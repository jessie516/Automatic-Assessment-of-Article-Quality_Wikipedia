He moved to [[Philadelphia]] in 1819, and established a weekly literary paper entitled the \\'\\'National Recorder\\'\\', whose name he changed in 1821 to the \\'\\'Saturday Magazine\\'\\'. \\nIn July 1822, he again changed it to a monthly called the \\'\\'Museum of Foreign Literature and Science\\'\\', which was edited during the first year by [[Robert Walsh (diplomat)|Robert Walsh]], and subsequently by himself and his brother Squier (born in [[Burlington, New Jersey]], 9 December 1803; died in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], 4 July 1886). After conducting this with great success for nearly 22 years, he moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]].\\n\\nIn Boston in April 1844, he began \\'\\'Littell\\'s Living Age\\'\\', a weekly literary periodical, published from an office at the corner of Bromfield and Tremont Streets.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Directory 1852&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855 he began the publication in Boston of the \\'\\'Panorama of Life and Literature\\'\\', a monthly. Littell was the author of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[[Tariff of 1833|Compromise Tariff]]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which was advocated by [[Henry Clay]] and carried through the [[U.S. Congress]] during the administration of [[Andrew Jackson|President Jackson]]. He died in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].\\n\\n==Family==\\nHis brother Squier Littell was a [[physician]] who eventually became surgeon to the Wills Ophthalmic Hospital of Philadelphia 1834\\xe2\\x80\\x931864. His brother John Stockton Littell (born in Burlington, New Jersey, in 1806; died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 11 July 1875) was an author who published a sketch of the \\'\\'Life, Character, and Services of Henry Clay\\'\\' and other pieces. Eliakim Littell\\'s grandfather of the same name was a captain in the [[American Revolution]], and did good service in the defence of [[Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey|Springfield, New Jersey]], 4 June 1780. The brothers\\' cousin William Littell (born in New Jersey about 1780; died in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], in 1825) was a lawyer, a member of the Kentucky bar, who for many years reported the decisions of the [[Court of Appeals|court of appeals]] of Kentucky. In addition to his legal publications, he wrote \\'\\'Festoons of Fancy in Essays, Humorous, Sentimental, and Political, in Prose and Verse\\'\\'.\\n\\n==Works==\\n{{Wikisource|Littell\\'s Living Age}}\\n{{wikiquote}}\\n* The Museum of Foreign Literature and Science.

It was built between 1968 and 1971 for [[North American Aviation]]/[[Rockwell International]], and designed by [[William Pereira]]. \\n\\nSince 1974 it has been owned and managed by the [[General Services Administration]]. [[National Archives and Records Administration]] had holdings for the Pacific region stored here, but has since moved to another location. Primary tenants are now regional offices of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service]].\\n\\n==History==\\n\\nThe building was designed by [[William Pereira]], who developed a stepped pyramid silhouette that is rare in American architecture. The unusual form refers to [[ziggurat]]s, ancient [[Mesopotamian]] temples.\\n\\nThe building was originally constructed in 1968 for [[North American Aviation]], a defense and aerospace industries manufacturer, to house the company\\'s corporate offices on the top floors and an electronics manufacturing plant on the bottom two floors. The building is located in the heart of a shallow valley surrounded by the San Joaquin Hills. The site was chosen in part because, in the mid-1960s, it was a very quiet area of southern Orange County. North American Aviation wanted an area that would be private and secure.  Construction took nearly three years, and in 1971 the building was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2015/08/09/the-ziggurat-how-a-white-elephant-became-a-county-landmark/|title=The Ziggurat: How a white elephant became a county landmark|date=Aug 9, 2015|access-date=Aug 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hunt Construction Group|Huber, Hunt &amp; Nichols, Inc.]] was the general contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Chet Holifield Federal Building Determination of Eligibility |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58e2d1d32994ca63f3cf33bd/t/60406a6ca32c6111c2e14bef/1614834295849/3.+CHFB+DoE+FINAL+2016-01-29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nThe building\\'s construction was undertaken at a transformative time in the defense industry: while it was still under construction, North American Aviation merged with [[Rockwell International]], a manufacturing conglomerate that worked in the defense and space industries. But, Rockwell never occupied the building.  \\n\\nThere are a couple of accounts as to why this happened: The more common story is that as the [[Vietnam War]] wound down, Rockwell\\'s defense contract with the federal government fell through. The company had a large building without enough work to support staff there.  \\n\\n[[William \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Morris]], a corporate architect for North American, who contributed to the building\\'s design, told the \\'\\'[[Orange County Register]]\\'\\' in 1993 that the building was deemed too fanciful for the defense contractor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe chairman of the board came to take a tour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Morris said of a 1969 visit to the building. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe got to the fourth floor and he said one thing, a short sentence: \\xe2\\x80\\x98This is far too nice for an electronics firm.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And everything came to a screeching halt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nDesigned to accommodate 7,000 aerospace employees, after the acquisition by Rockwell the building sat empty for several years.  Rockwell eventually offered to trade the building to the United States government in exchange for three surplus government facilities of equal value located near Los Angeles International Airport. In 1974, GSA assumed control of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nIn 1978, the [[United States Congress]] passed a bill to rename the building in honor of Democratic Congressman [[Chester E. Holifield|Chester E. &quot;Chet&quot; Holifield]],&lt;ref&gt;H.R.12138 -- A bill to name a certain Federal building in Laguna Niguel, California, the &quot;Chet Holifield Building&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; who had represented [[California\\'s 19th congressional district]] from 1943 to 1974. Much of the building continued to be vacant for the next decade. \\n\\nAfter GSA attempted to sell the building in the 1980s, it decided to keep it and assign agencies to it. This area of California had undergone rapid development while the building was held and federal agencies had increased staff in the area to serve the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; Today, the building\\'s primary tenants are the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. Holdings of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] for the Pacific region were once located in the building but have since been relocated to a new center in [[Perris, California]].\\n\\nIn 2019 the Chet Holifield Federal Building was one of five California properties on the list of Federal properties recommended for disposal by the Public Buildings Reform Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Enclosure - High Value Asset List |url=https://www.pbrb.gov/pbrb/files/2021/01/PBRB-Official-Recommendations-to-OMB-10_31_2019.pdf |website=Public Buildings Reform Board |publisher=United States Government |access-date=April 22, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2024 it was listed for sale on the [[General Services Administration|GSA]] auctions website with a starting bid of $70 Million. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=LAGUNA RIDGE |website=GSA Auctions |url=https://realestatesales.gov/gsaauctions/aucdsclnk?sl=SFRAN924107704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n==Architecture==\\nPerhaps innovative for its time, the building has more recently been described as &quot;appearing to be one part government building and two parts apocalyptic stronghold&quot;, and as a &quot;white elephant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThe sculptural Chet Holifield Federal Building is a stepped pyramidal form that has a similar appearance to ancient ziggurats. Architect [[William L. Pereira]] designed it. A large portion of the more than one million square foot building is below grade. It is located on a {{convert|92|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land in [[Laguna Niguel, California]], between [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]], and approximately {{convert|4|mi|km}} from the Pacific coastline.\\n\\nThe building has seven tiers and is constructed of angled, painted, pre-cast concrete panels with reticulation, a textured finish that displays curvilinear forms. The building displays some characteristics of the [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist style]] of Modern architecture, which is distinguished by weighty, massive forms; rough, exposed concrete surfaces; broad, expansive wall planes; and recessed windows.\\n\\nThe building has a concrete frame; the lateral force-resisting system consists of concrete shearwalls and single-level concrete moment frames. It was constructed on spread footings and caissons. Anodized aluminum windows, which are separated by slanting concrete walls with triangular forms, are recessed between the horizontal levels. Evenly spaced windows provide a consistent rhythm to the symmetrical building, which has a sprawling horizontal emphasis. The top tier of the building has a large flat roof with attached protruding vertical elements, providing additional texture to the structure.  The building also contains large amounts of asbestos that has been detected numerous times over the years, particularly during a water main break in March 2013.\\n\\nThe east entrance is trapezoidal in form, referencing the overall shape of the building. A moat of smooth rocks surrounds the building on three sides, alluding to the idea that the massive structure is a modern-day fortress. A formal, classically inspired, symmetrical plaza is located outside of the main entrance. Grass panels, trees, landscaped beds, and planters greet visitors and provide contrast to the massive concrete structure. When the site was developed, more than 2,500 trees and 6,500 shrubs were included in the initial landscape plan. Concrete benches echo the materials and form of the building.\\n\\nIn the lobby, both escalators and elevators provide high-speed vertical movement. Pereira\\'s efficient interior circulation system enabled a maximum travel time of approximately five minutes between any two points in the building. Select walls are covered in wood paneling and some areas contain wooden slat ceilings, several of which are coffered. Vinyl tile and carpet cover the floors. Portions of the interior were redesigned by GSA to accommodate increased office space.\\n\\nOther buildings on the site include a maintenance warehouse; 500,000-gallon water tank that services the fire protection system; energy plant, cooling tower; a 1,000,000-gallon thermal energy storage tank; and security buildings. A [[heliport]] is located on the site and additional landscaped areas are found throughout the large parcel. When constructed, the complex had 6,200 parking spaces, which radiate diagonally along the building axes, in anticipation of the thousands of employees expected to occupy the facility.\\n\\nIn 2003, state-of-the-art upgrades and modifications to the roofing were completed as part of an energy-saving plan that saves $650,000 per year in utility costs. Elevators, critical to efficient circulation in the building, were upgraded in 2005.\\n\\nNo extensive asbestos remediation has been undertaken by GSA to date although large amounts of asbestos are known to be contained above the drop ceiling tiles. Many of these tiles have been damaged and/or missing over the years. Many employees observed effects of this during March 2013, after a water pipe burst. Employees continued to work in affected areas although they often found white dust on their desks upon returning to work in the morning.  Employees were not informed about possible asbestos contamination until April 2013.  Since wider broadcast of asbestos contamination post-March 2013, yearly air sample tests are conducted. As of February 2018, Asbestos Containing Material (ACM) Inspection surveys have been distributed in attempts to contact former and current employees in what appears to be the first effort to compile data on possible asbestos-related illnesses/ deaths related to current/ former building staff members.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}\\n\\n[[File:Chet Holifield Federal Building 2013.jpg|thumb|325px|The north entrance in 2013]]\\n\\n==Timeline ==\\n*1968: Construction commences\\n*1971: Construction completed\\n*1974: GSA assumes ownership of building\\n*1975: Used in filming of \\'\\'[[Death Race 2000]]\\'\\'\\n*1978: Building renamed to honor Chet Holifield\\n*1995: Exterior used in filming of movie \\'\\'[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]\\'\\', starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Rene Russo]].

The 1936 [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]] building, designed by [[Arthur Brown, Jr.]], is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and is a contributing property to the [[San Francisco Civic Center|San Francisco Civic Center Historic District]], which is a [[National Historic Landmark]].\\n\\n==Building==\\nIn 1906, a [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|major earthquake devastated San Francisco]] and destroyed more than 28,000 buildings, many as a result of subsequent fires. As the city rebuilt, it adopted a plan for a civic center, first developed in 1899 by English architect [[B.J.S. Cahill]], to consolidate government buildings in a central location. The last building completed for the [[San Francisco Civic Center]], the Federal Building was a critical component of the seven-building complex that included government buildings, a library, and an opera house. The Civic Center design incorporates City Beautiful planning, a concept that relies on [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] design principles and classically inspired, monumental architecture. San Francisco\\'s Civic Center is one of the nation\\'s most successful examples of the [[City Beautiful]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA&quot;&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/portal/ext/html/site/hb/category/25431/actionParameter/exploreByBuilding/buildingId/588 Federal Building, San Francisco, CA], from the [[General Services Administration]].&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nIn 1927, the government allocated $2.5 million for the Federal Building\\'s design and construction, although final costs reached a total of $3 million. San Francisco city officials donated a site in 1930. Architect Arthur Brown, Jr. designed the building, which was constructed between 1934 and 1936, under the auspices of Supervising Architect of the Treasury Louis A. Simon. Brown studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the world\\'s preeminent architectural school, graduating in 1901. He was the sole architect of the Federal Building, as well as the Opera House and Veterans Building, both significant components of the Civic Center. Brown and his partner John Bakewell, Jr. designed City Hall, a 1915 Beaux Arts architectural masterpiece. Also located within the Civic Center, the City Hall commission established the partners\\' careers.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nIn 1975, construction commenced on United Nations Plaza, designed by noted landscape architect Lawrence Halprin and located next to the Federal Building. The one-acre pedestrian area was named to honor the establishment of the U.N., which occurred in the Veterans Building on June 26, 1945. The Federal Building is a contributing element to the San Francisco Civic Center, which the Secretary of the Interior designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The building was vacated in 2007 after the [[San Francisco Federal Building|new federal building]] was constructed in San Francisco. The U.S. [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) took over the building in 2013 after its renovation.\\n\\n===Architecture===\\n\\nThe Federal Building is an excellent example of Second Renaissance Revival architecture, displaying style-defining features such as distinct horizontal divisions, a rusticated base, and classical ornamentation including columns on the exterior elevations. The building occupies the block bounded by United Nations Plaza, and Hyde, McAllister, and Leavenworth streets. It has a rectangular footprint with an interior courtyard that allows natural light into the interior. The six-story steel frame is encased in fireproof concrete with concrete flooring and roof slabs, features that officials and architects agreed were important precautions after the fires resulting from the 1906 earthquake. The street elevation walls are constructed of brick but faced with granite, with the exception of a section of the McAllister Street elevation, which is faced in terracotta.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nAt the first two stories, the granite is rusticated to articulate the base of the building. The upper stories of the south facade, which faces United Nations Plaza, are covered with smooth-faced granite and dominated by a colonnade of detached two-story Doric columns that are aligned with Doric pilasters on the building. A classical balustrade supports the railing between the columns. Fenestration consists primarily of regularly spaced rectangular windows with multi-pane configurations. The attic story is set back from the wall plane of the building and is surrounded by a classical balustrade and topped by a molded cornice.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n[[File:Federal Office Building, San Francisco door.jpg|thumb|left|187px|A corner door]]\\n\\nThe main entrance, consisting of three arched openings, is located at the center of the south elevation. The central arch is topped by a keystone that contains a medallion with a carved shield motif, while the flanking arches each are topped by a medallion featuring an eagle holding olive branches. Secondary entrances are located on the southeast and southwest corners of the building, where the meeting points of the exterior walls have been designed as concave arc configurations. Round arches with ornate medallions placed on the keystones also mark these entrances, and Doric porticos are located above the second story of the corners. Male and female mascarons (carved faces) adorn the exterior. The carvings sport different horticulturally themed headpieces, including corn, wheat, cat tails, and oak leaves. The hipped roof is covered with light grey lead-coated copper.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThe main entrance vestibule and first-floor lobby are the most grand and richly detailed interior spaces in the building. The terrazzo flooring features a marble border. Grey marble wainscot, rising to a height of more than twenty-seven feet, covers the walls. Above the wainscot, the cast-stone walls spring into the barrel vaulted ceiling, which features molded hexagonal, rectangular, and diamond-shaped decorative coffers and shell motifs. A detailed cornice and doorway surmounted with a triangular pediment add to the classically inspired design of the entry spaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nCast-stone arches separate the first-floor elevator lobby from the corridors. The original bronze elevator doors remain and bronze is also used on other historic elements of the elevator lobby, including a mailbox, clocks, telephone booths, and building directory and bulletin board frames. The lobby leads to an internal courtyard that is open to the sky. Walkways are interspersed with trees, shrubbery, and groundcover plantings.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nSeveral significant interior spaces remain intact. The former Board Room for the U.S. Navy is located on the second floor. Paneled wainscot covers the lower portions of walls, while the upper areas are plaster. The former office of the General Inspector, Supply Corps is a rectangular room with rounded corners. Double-leaf French doors admit natural light and lead to an exterior balcony. A wood and plaster cornice tops the walls. The former Collector of Internal Revenue office contains a similar cornice and paneled wood wainscot covers the walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nAnother important interior space is the former naval Commandant\\'s Suite, a circular ceremonial room, twenty feet in diameter, with adjacent offices, restroom, dressing room, and waiting room. The parquet oak floor contains a centrally placed U.S. Navy seal. An original fireplace with an ornate verde antique marble Rococo-style mantel remains in the room.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n== History ==\\n[[File:A.I.D.S. Vigil at United Nations Plaza.jpg|thumb|267px|right|AIDS/ARC Vigil in 1985]]\\n\\nIn 1977, after frustration that the secretary of the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] had delayed signing regulations implementing [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] for four years, disability rights protestors marched to this federal building and began a sit-in that became a 26-day occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2015/11/09/patient-no-more-show-in-berkeley-documents-an-historic-disability-rights-protest/|title=\\'Patient No More\\' show in Berkeley documents a historic disability rights protest|last=Stange|first=Margit|date=2015-11-09|website=Berkeleyside|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[504 Sit-in]] was led by [[Judith Heumann]] and organized by [[Kitty Cone]].

Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse]]\\nThe \\'\\'\\'Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse\\'\\'\\' is a historic building on Stout Street in downtown [[Denver, Colorado]], which serves as a [[courthouse]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]]. Completed in 1965, the building was renamed for Colorado Congressman [[Byron G. Rogers]] in 1984. In 1996 and 1997, the criminal case against bomber [[Timothy McVeigh]] was conducted there.  Additionally, the federal building is home to 11 federal agencies, including the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]\\'s new Rocky Mountain Regional location that opened on June 30, 2014.  The building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2016.\\n\\n==Building history==\\n\\nIn the years following [[World War II]], the population of Denver, Colorado, grew rapidly as numerous federal agencies located to the city. The existing federal building could no longer accommodate growing space needs, and the government began planning for a new complex to house the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado|United States District Court]] and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]]. In 1959, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) selected the accomplished Denver architectural firm [[James Sudler Associates]] as the lead designer, with another skilled Denver firm, Fisher &amp; Davis, assisting. James Sudler designed numerous Modern buildings in the Denver area, including the exuberant Church of the Risen Christ and the [[Denver Art Museum]] (with [[Gio Ponti]]).\\n\\nIn 1961, the federal government allotted $687,000 to purchase the downtown Denver site, bound by Champa, Stout, Nineteenth, and Twentieth streets, adjacent to the existing post office and custom house. Officials appropriated an additional $20 million in 1962 for the construction of the complex, with groundbreaking occurring the same year. The first occupants moved into the building in 1965. In 1984, the complex was named to honor [[Byron G. Rogers]] (1900-1983), who represented Colorado in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1951 to 1971. Rogers was instrumental in securing the original funds for the courthouse.\\n\\nThe trial of [[Timothy McVeigh]], the bomber responsible for the 1995 attack on the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]], was held at the courthouse in 1996 and 1997. To find an impartial jury, the court moved the case to Denver, where McVeigh was tried and convicted.\\n\\nIn 1999, GSA initiated alterations to the entrance to accommodate security needs. Local preservationists asked GSA to consider the potential significance of the complex before commencing work that would alter character-defining features. As a result, GSA developed a sensitive design that retained these important elements. The unexpected public interest led GSA to commission a study to better understand the architecture and context of buildings from this era. In 2003, GSA published Growth, Efficiency, and Modernism: GSA Buildings of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. The publication has received several awards and strengthened GSA\\'s reputation as a leader in the preservation field.\\n\\n==Architecture==\\n\\nThe courthouse consists of three distinct components: an 18-story office tower, a low courthouse, and a landscaped plaza. This three-part design combination was typical of Modern architecture and is perhaps best exemplified by the [[United Nations Headquarters]] complex in [[Manhattan|New York]]. Sudler\\'s design for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse is an excellent example of Formalism, a style of Modern architecture that incorporates flat rooflines, columnar supports, symmetry, high-quality materials, and works of art.\\n\\nThe tall office building has an unusual, angular footprint. While the center sections measure 103 feet in width, the ends are only 80 feet wide. The street level is clad in white marble panels, as are the narrow unfenestrated elevations of the building. Upper stories of the primary elevations exhibit an alternating rhythm of beige pre-cast concrete panels and projecting windows. Public spaces on the interior have marble wainscoting and terrazzo floors with bronze dividers. The low, rectangular courthouse derives its form from two nearby federal buildings that inspired Sudler: the 1931 U.S. Custom House and the 1916 [[Byron R. White United States Courthouse]] (the former main post office). Sudler\\'s design alludes to earlier classical architecture in scale, form, and color of materials. The building is clad primarily in pre-cast aggregate stone panels with a light tan color. On the Champa Street elevation, the panels have profiles that evoke the footprint and windows of the office tower. White marble is visible in bands at the top and bottom of the courthouse. Windows are oriented vertically and in pairs, running in tall bands divided by thin strips of marble. The Stout Street elevation features a metal art screen, a common element of Formalism, over large windows; the screen also serves to control direct sunlight on the interior. Like the office tower, interior public spaces of the courthouse have marble wainscoting and terrazzo floors. The courtroom walls are finished in panels of alternating polished light and dark woods with prominent grain patterns.\\n\\n[[Public art]] is a critical component of the complex. GSA allotted $50,000 of the original construction budget for works of art. Pieces include the large bronze [[Great Seal of the United States]] and a stylized [[mahogany]] carving called \\'\\'Justice, Freedom, and the Release from Bondage\\'\\', both by Denver sculptor William Joseph. A bronze bas-relief art column entitled \\'\\'Federal Services\\'\\' by [[Edgar Britton]] is located within the landscaped plaza. The column resembles a totem pole and contains carvings inspired by [[Native American art]]. The cylinder originally acted as a canopy support, but was moved when the entrance was reconfigured. In 2006, Jim Campbell created a dynamic light installation along the Champa Street elevation, with a companion piece in the main lobby.\\n\\nIn 1999, GSA initiated a $1.65 million project as part of its First Impressions program. The plaza and entrance configuration were modified to improve security screening and make the facility more efficient and welcoming to employees and visitors. The inviting new plaza skillfully and unobtrusively incorporates security features as well as elements of the architects\\' design that were never constructed. The existing covered walkway, or canopy, was retained and a new glass pavilion was added at the convergence of the office tower and the courthouse to facilitate security screening. New lighting and a restored water feature were also included in the design. The project received a Standing Ovation Award from [[Historic Denver]], Inc., in 2001 and a 2006 Honor Award from the Denver Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]].\\n\\nThe low courthouse building underwent a full modernization between 2002 and 2006. The project included upgrades to mechanical systems, reconfiguration of interior spaces, and [[asbestos abatement]].\\n\\n==Significant events==\\n* 1959: Architects James Sudler Associates and Fisher &amp; Davis retained\\n* 1962: Construction begins\\n* 1965: Construction completed\\n* 1966: Building dedicated\\n* 1984: Building named to honor Byron G.

It is a courthouse for the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]].\\n\\n==Building history==\\n\\nThe Federal Building and U.S. Custom House is part of a complex of four federal buildings located in close proximity to each other in downtown Denver, the others being the [[Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse|Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse]], the [[Byron White United States Courthouse|Byron White U.S. Courthouse]], and the [[Alfred A. Arraj United States Courthouse|Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse]].&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/ext/html/site/hb/category/25431/actionParameter/exploreByBuilding/buildingId/745|title=GSA - Find a Building|date=2009-08-24|work= Federal Building and U.S. Custom House, Denver, CO : Building Overview|publisher=U.S. General Services Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nThe federal government acquired the site, which was previously home to the East Denver High School, in three parcels between 1928 and 1930 for just under $300,000. The building replaced Denver\\'s overcrowded 1892 custom house, located at another location in the city.&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nDesigns for the original portion of the building, completed in 1931, came from the [[Office of the Supervising Architect]] of the U.S. Treasury, which at that time was led by [[James A. Wetmore]]. Both this building and the nearby Byron White U.S. Courthouse are clad in the same Colorado [[Yule marble]] used in the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] in Washington, D.C. Indiana [[limestone]] was originally planned for cladding the building, and would have been less expensive. However, members of Congress from Colorado successfully argued for use of local materials. The building was completed in May 1931 at a total cost of $1,260,000.&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nA 1937 addition nearly doubled the size of the building. Denver architects [[Temple Hoyne Buell]] and [[G. Meredith Musick]] designed the addition. The cladding material was once again controversial. In this case, Colorado Yule marble was substituted for Georgia marble after local officials successfully argued that the materials of the original building and addition should match, and that the revenue from the marble purchase should benefit Colorado.&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThough it housed various federal agencies, the building\\'s primary occupant was the [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs Service]]. Its revenues averaged $500,000 per year, and eventually climbed to $1,400,000 in 1957. In need of more space, the Customs Service moved to the former [[Stapleton Airport]] in 1957. The major building tenant is now the [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy court]].&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt; The building has been listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1979.&lt;ref name =&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, protesters often used the U.S. Courthouse plaza across the street. In 1975, a bomb exploded in a first floor men\\'s room of the building, but there was no significant structural damage. A group calling themselves the Continental Revolutionary Army took credit for the bombing.&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n==Architecture==\\n\\nThe five-story Federal Building and U.S. Custom House is a skillfully executed example of Second [[Renaissance Revival architecture]]. The arched first floor window and door openings, detailed cornices, emphasis on the horizontal elements, and stately overall appearance of the building are all characteristic of this architectural style. It has a steel frame on poured concrete footings and a flat composite roof. The base is clad in granite, as are the stairs leading to the entry doors. The remainder of the Nineteenth, Stout, and California street elevations of the building are clad in smooth-rubbed, coarse cut Colorado Yule marble with terra-cotta ornamentation. The fifth floor, which is recessed eight feet, is clad in brick, as are the courtyard-facing elevations of the building.&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nMarble quoins (cornerstones) highlight the transition from marble to brick facade. [[Terracotta]] is used for a belt course above the first floor, cornices, and spandrels between the windows of the second and third, and third and fourth stories. Decorative terra cotta swags are located above the ornamental grillwork that flanks the main entry door. The symmetrical plan is E-shaped with a semi-enclosed courtyard at the north end. The windows are spaced evenly and are designed to create a balanced overall look for the building. The tops of the first floor windows and the main entry doorway are arched. Spandrels that separate the second, third, and fourth story windows feature eagles and shields, emphasizing the federal use of the building. The primary entrance is on Nineteenth Street at the midpoint of the south elevation, and a penthouse is located above this central point that rises twenty feet above the parapet coping (decorative capping at the top of the wall).&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThe centered main entry is the focal point of the exterior. In 1972, the original bronze entry doors were removed and replaced with aluminum doors. A terracotta eagle tops a semicircular fanlight above the doorway. [[Tuscan order]] columns flanking the entrance support an entablature inscribed with the name of the building and capped by a decorative [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]].&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nIn the lobby, polished Colorado Yule marble surrounds the doors leading from the vestibule and clads the lower portion of the walls on either side of those doors. It also surrounds the elevators and extends for several feet on either side of the elevators, covering the lower portion of the walls. Only one of the light fixtures, which have oval etched-glass domes suspended within brass frameworks and hanging from the ceiling via brass chains, is original; the others were replicated. The bronze and leaded glass doors between the vestibule and the lobby were recently restored. Glass panes allow light to flood the lobby and the bronze surrounds and details reinforce the stately appearance of the building. There are staircases with marble treads at each end of the corridors leading off of the lobby. The layout of each floor of the building is identical, with offices lining each corridor. The wainscoting and baseboards are all marble, as are the bathroom partitions in the 1931 portion of the building.&lt;ref name =&quot;GSA&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nThe 1937 addition resulted in extensions to each side of the building that nearly doubled the area and made the central courtyard less visible from the street. Additional penthouses were added at the California and Stout Street ends of the building to house the upper portions of the elevator shafts.

The centre of English Catholicism was the [[English College, Douai|English College]] at [[Douai]] ([[University of Douai]], France) founded in 1568 by [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]], formerly of [[Queen\\'s College, Oxford]], and Canon of York, and subsequently [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], for the purpose of training priests to convert the English again to Catholicism. And it was here where the Catholic translation of the Bible into English was produced.\\n\\nA run of a few hundred or more of the New Testament, in [[quarto]] form (not large folio), was published in the last months of 1582 (Herbert #177), during a temporary migration of the college to [[Rheims]]; consequently, it has been commonly known as the Rheims New Testament. Though he died in the same year as its publication, this translation was principally the work of [[Gregory Martin (scholar)|Gregory Martin]], formerly Fellow of [[St. John\\'s College, Oxford]], close friend of [[Edmund Campion]]. He was assisted by others at Douai, notably Allen, [[Richard Bristow]], [[William Reynolds (theologian)|William Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Worthington (Douai)|Thomas Worthington]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/8300/8300-h/8300-h.htm Gutenberg website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://originaldouayrheims.com Original Douay Rheims.com website]&lt;/ref&gt; who proofed and provided notes and annotations. The [[Old Testament]] is stated to have been ready at the same time but, for want of funds, it could not be printed until later, after the college had returned to Douai. It is commonly known as the Douay Old Testament. It was issued as two quarto volumes dated 1609 and 1610 (Herbert #300). These first New Testament and Old Testament editions followed the [[Geneva Bible]] not only in their quarto format but also in the use of Roman type.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}\\n\\n[[File:1582_Rhemes_New_Testament.pdf|thumb|250px|Title page of the 1582 Rheims New Testament, transcribed into Modern English &quot;specially for the discovery of the corruptions of divers late translations, and for clearing the controversies in religion.&quot;]]\\nAs a recent translation, the Rheims New Testament had an influence on the translators of the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]]. Afterwards it ceased to be of interest to the Anglican church. Although the cities are now commonly spelled as [[Douai]] and as [[Reims]], the Bible continues to be published as the \\'\\'Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims Bible\\'\\' and has formed the basis of some later [[Catholic Bible]]s in English.\\n\\nThe title page runs: &quot;The Holy Bible, faithfully translated into English out of the authentic Latin. Diligently conferred with the Hebrew, Greek and other Editions&quot;. The cause of the delay was &quot;our poor state of banishment&quot;, but there was also the matter of reconciling the Latin to the other editions. William Allen went to Rome and worked, with others, on the revision of the Vulgate. The [[Sixtine Vulgate]] edition was published in 1590. The definitive [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate|Clementine]] text followed in 1592. Worthington, responsible for many of the annotations for the 1609 and 1610 volumes, states in the preface: &quot;we have again conferred this English translation and conformed it to the most perfect Latin Edition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Orchard, \\'\\'A Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture\\'\\', (Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, 1951). Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n==Style ==\\nThe Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims Bible is a translation of the [[Latin Vulgate]], which is itself a translation of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] texts. The Vulgate was largely created due to the efforts of Saint [[Jerome]] (345&amp;ndash;420), whose translation was declared to be the authentic Latin version of the Bible by the [[Council of Trent]]. While the Catholic scholars &quot;conferred&quot; with the Hebrew and [[Greek language|Greek]] originals, as well as with &quot;other editions in diverse languages&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;1582 Rheims New Testament, &quot;Preface to the Reader.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; their avowed purpose was to translate [[formal translation|after a strongly literal manner]] from the Latin Vulgate, for reasons of accuracy as stated in their Preface and which tended to produce, in places, stilted syntax and Latinisms. The following short passage (\\'\\'[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 3:6&amp;ndash;12\\'\\'), is a fair example, admittedly without updating the spelling conventions then in use:\\n\\n{{blockquote|The Gentiles to be coheires and concorporat and comparticipant of his promise in Christ JESUS by the Gospel: whereof I am made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given me according to the operation of his power. To me the least of al the sainctes is given this grace, among the Gentils to evangelize the unsearcheable riches of Christ, and to illuminate al men what is the dispensation of the sacrament hidden from worldes in God, who created all things: that the manifold wisdom of God, may be notified to the Princes and Potestats in the celestials by the Church, according to the prefinition of worldes, which he made in Christ JESUS our Lord. In whom we have affiance and accesse in confidence, by the faith of him.}}\\n\\nOther than when rendering the particular readings of the Vulgate Latin, the English wording of the Rheims New Testament follows more or less closely the [[Protestant]] version first produced by [[William Tyndale]] in 1525, an important source for the Rheims translators having been identified as that of the revision of Tyndale found in an English and Latin diglot New Testament, published by [[Miles Coverdale]] in Paris in 1538.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, G. J. [https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic30philuoft#page/566/mode/2up &quot;The Evolution of Our English Bible&quot;], \\'\\'The American Catholic Quarterly Review\\'\\', Vol. XXX, page 581, 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Making of the English Bible|first= Benson|last = Bobrick|publisher = Phoenix|date = 2001| pages = 196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= \\'\\'The English Versions of the Bible\\'\\'; in R.C.

Consequently, the Rheims New Testament is much less of a new version, and owes rather more to the original languages, than the translators admit in their preface. Where the Rheims translators depart from the Coverdale text, they frequently adopt readings found in the Protestant [[Geneva Bible]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Making of the English Bible|first= Benson|last = Bobrick|publisher = Phoenix|date = 2001| pages = 195}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those of the [[Wycliffe\\'s Bible|Wycliffe]] Bible, as this latter version had been translated from the Vulgate, and had been widely used by English Catholic churchmen unaware of its [[Lollard]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bruce|first=Frederick Fyvie|title=John Wycliffe and the English Bible|url=http://www.churchsociety.org/churchman/documents/Cman_098_4_Bruce.pdf|publisher=Church society|journal=Churchman|date=April 1998|access-date=September 22, 2015|archive-date=July 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728190209/http://www.churchsociety.org/churchman/documents/Cman_098_4_Bruce.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= \\'\\'The English Versions of the Bible\\'\\'; in R.C.

Many highly regarded translations of the Bible routinely consult Vulgate readings, especially in certain difficult Old Testament passages; but nearly all modern Bible versions, Protestant and Catholic, go directly to original-language Hebrew, [[Aramaic]], and Greek biblical texts as their translation base, and not to a secondary version like the Vulgate. The translators justified their preference for the Vulgate in their Preface, pointing to accumulated corruptions within the original language manuscripts available in that era, and asserting that [[Jerome]] would have had access to better manuscripts in the original tongues that had not survived. Moreover, they could point to the Council of Trent\\'s decree that the Vulgate was, for Catholics, free of doctrinal error.\\n\\nIn their decision consistently to apply Latinate language, rather than everyday English, to render religious terminology, the Rheims&amp;ndash;Douay translators continued a tradition established by [[Thomas More]] and [[Stephen Gardiner]] in their criticisms of the biblical translations of William Tyndale. Gardiner indeed had himself applied these principles in 1535 to produce a heavily revised version, which has not survived, of Tyndale\\'s translations of the Gospels of Luke and John. More and Gardiner had argued that Latin terms were more precise in meaning than their English equivalents, and consequently should be retained in Englished form to avoid ambiguity. However, David Norton observes that the Rheims&amp;ndash;Douay version extends the principle much further. In the preface to the Rheims New Testament the translators criticise the Geneva Bible for their policy of striving always for clear and unambiguous readings; the Rheims translators proposed rather a rendering of the English biblical text that is faithful to the Latin text, whether or not such a word-for-word translation results in hard to understand English, or transmits ambiguity from the Latin phrasings:\\n\\n{{blockquote|1=we presume not in hard places to modifie the speaches or phrases, but religiously keepe them word for word, and point for point, for feare of missing or restraining the sense of the holy Ghost to our phantasie...acknowledging with S. Hierom, that in other writings it is ynough to give in translation, sense for sense, but that in Scriptures, lest we misse the sense, we must keep the very wordes.}}\\n\\nThis adds to More and Gardiner the opposite argument, that previous versions in standard English had improperly imputed clear meanings for obscure passages in the Greek source text where the Latin Vulgate had often tended to rather render the Greek literally, even to the extent of generating improper Latin constructions. In effect, the Rheims translators argue that, where the source text is ambiguous or obscure, then a faithful English translation should also be ambiguous or obscure, with the options for understanding the text discussed in a marginal note:\\n\\n{{blockquote|1=so, that people must read them with licence of their spiritual superior, as in former times they were in like sort limited. such also of the Laitie, yea &amp; of the meaner learned Clergie, as were permitted to read holie Scriptures, did not presume to inteprete hard places, nor high Mysteries, much lesse to dispute and contend, but leaving the discussion thereof to the more learned, searched rather and noted the godlie and imitable examples of good life and so learned more humilitie, obedience... }}\\n\\nThe translation was prepared with a definite [[polemic]]al purpose in opposition to Protestant translations (which also had polemical motives). Prior to the Douay-Rheims, the only printed English language Bibles available had been Protestant translations. The Tridentine&amp;ndash;Florentine [[Biblical canon]] was naturally used, with the [[Deuterocanonical books]] incorporated into the Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims Old Testament, and only 3 Esdras, 4 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] section.\\n\\nThe translators excluded the apocryphal Psalm 151, this unusual oversight given the otherwise &quot;complete&quot; nature of the book is explained in passing by the annotations to Psalm 150 that &quot;S. Augustin in the conclusion of his ... Sermons upon the Psalms, explicateth a mysterie in the number of an hundred and fieftie[.]&quot;\\n\\n==Influence==\\n[[File:Title Page of the Rheims New Testament with the first page of the Gospel According to Matthew Compared with the Bishop\\'s Bible, 1589.jpg|thumb|Title page of the Rheims New Testament alongside the first page of the Gospel According to Matthew from the Bishops\\' Bible, 1589, edited by William Fulke, who believed the Bishops\\' Bible New Testament was superior to the Rheims New Testament]]\\n\\nIn England the Protestant [[William Fulke]] unintentionally popularized the Rheims New Testament through his collation of the Rheims text and annotations in parallel columns alongside the 1572 Protestant [[Bishops\\' Bible]]. Fulke\\'s original intention through his first combined edition of the Rheims New Testament with the so-called Bishops\\' Bible was to prove that the Catholic-inspired text was inferior to the Protestant-influenced Bishops\\' Bible, then the official Bible of the Church of England. Fulke\\'s work was first published in 1589; and as a consequence the Rheims text and notes became easily available without fear of criminal sanctions.\\n\\nThe translators of the Rheims appended a list of these unfamiliar words;&lt;ref&gt;Appendices, &quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kofWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA771 The Explication of Certaine Wordes]&quot; or &quot;[http://www.catholicfirst.com/thefaith/bible/appendix.html Hard Wordes Explicated]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; examples include &quot;acquisition&quot;, &quot;adulterate&quot;, &quot;advent&quot;, &quot;allegory&quot;, &quot;verity&quot;, &quot;calumniate&quot;, &quot;character&quot;, &quot;cooperate&quot;, &quot;prescience&quot;, &quot;resuscitate&quot;, &quot;victim&quot;, and &quot;evangelise&quot;. In addition the editors chose to transliterate rather than translate a number of technical Greek or Hebrew terms, such as &quot;[[azymes]]&quot; for unleavened bread, and &quot;pasch&quot; for [[Passover]].\\n\\n== Challoner Revision {{anchor|Challoner Revision}}==\\n\\n===Translation===\\nThe original Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims Bible was published during a time when Catholics were being persecuted in Britain and Ireland and possession of the Douay\\xe2\\x80\\x93Rheims Bible was a crime. By the time possession was not a crime the English of the Douay\\xe2\\x80\\x93Rheims Bible was a hundred years out-of-date. It was thus substantially &quot;revised&quot; between 1749 and 1777 by [[Richard Challoner]], the Vicar Apostolic of London. Bishop Challoner was assisted by Father [[Francis Blyth]], a Carmelite Friar. Challoner\\'s revisions borrowed heavily from the King James Version (being a convert from [[Protestantism]] to [[Catholicism]] and thus familiar with its style). The use of the Rheims New Testament by the translators of the King James Version is discussed below. Challoner not only addressed the odd prose and much of the Latinisms, but produced a version which, while still called the Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims, was little like it, notably removing most of the lengthy annotations and marginal notes of the original translators, the lectionary table of gospel and epistle readings for the Mass. He retained the full 73 books of the Vulgate proper, aside from Psalm 151. At the same time he aimed for improved readability and comprehensibility, rephrasing obscure and obsolete terms and constructions and, in the process, consistently removing ambiguities of meaning that the original Rheims&amp;ndash;Douay version had intentionally striven to retain.\\n\\nThis is \\'\\'Ephesians 3:6&amp;ndash;12\\'\\' in the original 1582 Douay-Rheims New Testament:\\n\\n{{blockquote|The Gentils to be coheires and concorporate and comparticipant of his promise in Christ IESVS by the Ghospel: wherof I am made a Minister according to the guift of the grace of God, which is giuen me according to the operation of his power.

In whom we haue affiance and accesse in confidence by the faith of him.}}\\n\\nThe same passage in Challoner\\'s revision gives a hint of the thorough stylistic editing he did of the text:\\n\\n{{blockquote|That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body: and copartners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power.

He followed this with an edition of the whole bible in 1750, making some 200 further changes to the New Testament. He issued a further version of the New Testament in 1752, which differed in about 2,000 readings from the 1750 edition, and which remained the base text for further editions of the bible in Challoner\\'s lifetime. In all three editions the extensive notes and commentary of the 1582/1610 original were drastically reduced, resulting in a compact one-volume edition of the Bible, which contributed greatly to its popularity. Gone also was the longer paragraph formatting of the text; instead, the text was broken up so that each verse was its own paragraph. The [[Biblical apocrypha#Clementine Vulgate|three apocrypha]], which had been placed in an appendix to the second volume of the Old Testament, were dropped. Subsequent editions of the Challoner revision, of which there have been very many, reproduce his Old Testament of 1750 with very few changes.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}\\n\\nChalloner\\'s 1752 New Testament was extensively further revised by Bernard MacMahon in a series of Dublin editions from 1783 to 1810, for the most part adjusting the text away from agreement with that of the King James Version, and these various Dublin versions are the source of many, but not all, Challoner versions printed in the United States in the 19th century. Editions of the Challoner Bible printed in England sometimes follow one or another of the revised Dublin New Testament texts, but more often tend to follow Challoner\\'s earlier editions of 1749 and 1750 (as do most 20th-century printings, and on-line versions of the Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims bible circulating on the internet). An edition of the Challoner-MacMahon revision with commentary by [[George Leo Haydock]] and Benedict Rayment was completed in 1814, and a reprint of Haydock by [[F. C. Husenbeth]] in 1850 was [[imprimatur|approved]] by [[Bishop Wareing]]. A reprint of an approved 1859 edition with Haydock\\'s unabridged notes was published in 2014 by Loreto Publications.\\n\\nThe Challoner version, officially approved by the Church, remained the Bible of the majority of English-speaking Catholics well into the 20th century. It was first published in America in 1790 by Mathew Carey of Philadelphia. {{anchor|DRA}}Several American editions followed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, prominent among them an edition published in 1899 by the John Murphy Company of Baltimore, with the \\'\\'[[imprimatur]]\\'\\' of [[James Gibbons|James Cardinal Gibbons]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archbishop of Baltimore]]. This edition included a chronology that was consistent with [[young-earth creationism]] (specifically, one based on [[James Ussher]]\\'s [[Ussher chronology|calculation of the year of creation]] as 4004 BC). In 1914, the John Murphy Company published a new edition with a modified chronology consistent with new findings in Catholic scholarship; in this edition, no attempt was made to attach precise dates to the events of the first eleven chapters of Genesis, and many of the dates calculated in the 1899 edition were wholly revised. This edition received the approval of [[John Murphy Farley|John Cardinal Farley]] and [[William Henry O\\'Connell|William Cardinal O\\'Connell]] and was subsequently reprinted, with new type, by P. J. Kenedy &amp; Sons. Yet another edition was published in the United States by the Douay Bible House in 1941 with the \\'\\'imprimatur\\'\\' of [[Francis Spellman|Francis Cardinal Spellman]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archbishop of New York]]. In 1941 the New Testament and Psalms of the Douay\\xe2\\x80\\x93Rheims Bible were again heavily revised to produce the New Testament (and in some editions, the Psalms) of the [[Confraternity Bible]]. However, so extensive were these changes that it was no longer identified as the Douay\\xe2\\x80\\x93Rheims.\\n\\nIn the wake of the 1943 promulgation of [[Pope Pius XII]]\\'s encyclical \\'\\'[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]\\'\\', which authorized the creation of vernacular translations of the Catholic Bible based upon the original Hebrew and Greek, the Douay-Rheims/Challoner Bible was supplanted by subsequent Catholic English translations. The Challoner revision ultimately fell out of print by the late 1960s, only coming back into circulation when [[TAN Books]] reprinted the 1899 Murphy edition in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About TAN Books and publishers, Inc.|url=http://www.tanbooks.com/abouttan.htm|website=tanbooks.com|publisher=TAN Books|access-date=August 6, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981206053705/http://www.tanbooks.com/abouttan.htm|archive-date=December 6, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n==Names of books==\\nThe names, numbers, and chapters of the Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims Bible and the Challoner revision follow that of the Vulgate and therefore differ from those of the King James Version and its modern successors, making direct comparison of versions tricky in some places. For instance, the books called [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] in the King James Version are called 1 and 2 Esdras in the Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims Bible. The books called [[1 Esdras|1]] and [[2 Esdras]] in the King James Version are called 3 and 4 Esdras in the Douay, and were classed as apocrypha. A table illustrating the differences can be found [[Books of the Latin Vulgate|here]].\\n\\nThe names, numbers, and order of the books in the Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims Bible follow those of the Vulgate except that the three apocryphal books are placed after the Old Testament in the Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims Bible; in the [[Clementine Vulgate]] they come after the [[New Testament]]. These three apocrypha are omitted entirely in the Challoner revision.\\n\\nThe Psalms of the Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims Bible follow the numbering of the [[Vulgate]] and the [[Septuagint]], whereas those in the KJV follow that of [[Masoretic Text]]. For details of the differences see the article on the [[Psalms]]. A summary list is shown below:\\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;\\n|+Psalm number correspondences\\n!width=&quot;50%&quot;| Douay&amp;ndash;Rheims\\n!width=&quot;50%&quot;| King James Version\\n|-\\n|colspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;|1&amp;ndash;8\\n|-\\n|align=&quot;right&quot;| 9\\n| 9&amp;ndash;10\\n|-\\n|align=&quot;right&quot;| 10&amp;ndash;112\\n| 11&amp;ndash;113\\n|-\\n|align=&quot;right&quot;| 113\\n| 114&amp;ndash;115\\n|-\\n|align=&quot;right&quot;| 114&amp;ndash;115\\n| 116\\n|-\\n|align=&quot;right&quot;| 116&amp;ndash;145\\n| 117&amp;ndash;146\\n|-\\n|align=&quot;right&quot;| 146&amp;ndash;147\\n| 147\\n|-\\n|colspan=2 align=center|148&amp;ndash;150\\n|}\\n\\n==Influence on the King James Version==\\n\\nThe Old Testament &quot;Douay&quot; translation of the Latin Vulgate arrived too late on the scene to have played any part in influencing the [[King James Version]].&lt;ref&gt;As noted in Pollard, Dr Alfred W. \\'\\'Records of the English Bible: The Documents Relating to the Translation and Publication of the Bible in English, 1525&amp;ndash;1611\\'\\', London, Oxford University Press, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rheims New Testament had, however, been available for over twenty years. In the form of William Fulke\\'s parallel version, it was readily accessible. Nevertheless, the official instructions to the King James Version translators omitted the Rheims version from the list of previous English translations that should be consulted, probably deliberately.\\n\\nThe degree to which the King James Version drew on the Rheims version has, therefore, been the subject of considerable debate; with James G Carleton in his book \\'\\'The Part of Rheims in the Making of the English Bible\\'\\'&lt;ref&gt;Clarendon Press, Oxford 1902&lt;/ref&gt; arguing for a very extensive influence, while Charles C Butterworth proposed that the actual influence was small, relative to those of the [[Bishops\\' Bible]] and the [[Geneva Bible]].\\n\\nMuch of this debate was resolved in 1969, when Ward Allen published a partial transcript of the minutes made by [[John Bois]] of the proceedings of the General Committee of Review for the King James Version (i.e., the supervisory committee which met in 1610 to review the work of each of the separate translation \\'companies\\'). Bois records the policy of the review committee in relation to a discussion of \\'\\'1 Peter 1:7\\'\\' &quot;we have not thought the indefinite sense ought to be defined&quot;; which reflects the strictures expressed by the Rheims translators against concealing ambiguities in the original text. Allen shows that in several places, notably in the reading &quot;manner of time&quot; at \\'\\'Revelation 13:8\\'\\', the reviewers incorporated a reading from the Rheims text specifically in accordance with this principle. More usually, however, the King James Version handles obscurity in the source text by supplementing their preferred clear English formulation with a literal translation as a marginal note. Bois shows that many of these marginal translations are derived, more or less modified, from the text or notes of the Rheims New Testament; indeed Rheims is explicitly stated as the source for the marginal reading at \\'\\'Colossians 2:18\\'\\'.\\n\\nIn 1995, Ward Allen in collaboration with Edward Jacobs further published a collation, for the four Gospels, of the marginal amendments made to a copy of the Bishops\\' Bible (now conserved in the Bodleian Library), which transpired to be the formal record of the textual changes being proposed by several of the companies of King James Version translators. They found around a quarter of the proposed amendments to be original to the translators; but that three-quarters had been taken over from other English versions. Overall, about one-fourth of the proposed amendments adopted the text of the Rheims New Testament. &quot;And the debts of the [KJV] translators to earlier English Bibles are substantial. The translators, for example, in revising the text of the synoptic Gospels in the Bishops\\' Bible, owe about one-fourth of their revisions, each, to the Geneva and Rheims New Testaments. Another fourth of their work can be traced to the work of Tyndale and Coverdale. And the final fourth of their revisions is original to the translators themselves&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Allen| first = Ward S|title = The Coming of the King James Gospels; a collation of the Translators work-in-progress|publisher = University of Arkansas Press| date = 1995| pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\nOtherwise the English text of the King James New Testament can often be demonstrated as adopting latinate terminology also found in the Rheims version of the same text. In the majority of cases, these Latinisms could also have been derived directly from the versions of Miles Coverdale or the [[Wyclif Bible]] (i.e., the source texts for the Rheims translators), but they would have been most readily accessible to the King James translators in Fulke\\'s parallel editions. This also explains the incorporation into the King James Version from the Rheims New Testament of a number of striking English phrases, such as &quot;publish and blaze abroad&quot; at \\'\\'Mark 1:45\\'\\'.\\n\\n==Douay-Rheims Only movement==\\nMuch like the case with the King James Version, the Douay\\xe2\\x80\\x93Rheims has a number of devotees who believe that it is a superiorly authentic translation in the English language, or, more broadly, that the Douay is to be preferred over all other English translations of Scripture. Apologist [[Jimmy Akin]] opposes this view, arguing that while the Douay is an important translation in Catholic history, it is not to be elevated to such status, as new manuscript discoveries and scholarship have challenged that view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/uncomfortable-facts-about-the-douay-rheims|title=Uncomfortable Facts About the Douay-Rheims|last=Akin|first=Jimmy|date=February 1, 2002|website=[[Catholic Answers|Catholic Answers Magazine]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180324094548/https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/uncomfortable-facts-about-the-douay-rheims|archive-date=March 24, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n==Modern Harvard-Dumbarton Oaks Vulgate==\\n\\nHarvard University Press, and Swift Edgar and Angela Kinney at Dumbarton Oaks Library have used a version of Challoner\\'s Douay\\xe2\\x80\\x93Rheims Bible as both the basis for the English text in a dual Latin-English Bible (The Vulgate Bible, six volumes) and, unusually, they have also used the English text of the Douay-Rheims in combination with the modern \\'\\'Biblia Sacra Vulgata\\'\\' to reconstruct (in part) the pre-Clementine Vulgate that was the basis for the Douay-Rheims for the Latin text. This is possible only because the Douay-Rheims, alone among English Bibles, and even in the Challoner revision, attempted a word-for-word translation of the underlying Vulgate. A noted example of the literalness of the translation is the differing versions of the Lord\\'s Prayer, which has two versions in the Douay-Rheims: the Luke version uses \\'daily bread\\' (translating the Vulgate \\'\\'quotidianum\\'\\') and the version in Matthew reads &quot;supersubstantial bread&quot; (translating from the Vulgate \\'\\'supersubstantialem\\'\\'). Every other English Bible translation uses &quot;daily&quot; in both places; the underlying Greek word is the same in both places, and Jerome translated the word in two different ways because then, as now, the actual meaning of the Greek word \\'\\'epiousion\\'\\' was unclear.\\n\\nThe Harvard\\xe2\\x80\\x93Dumbarton Oaks editors have been criticized in the \\'\\'[[The Medieval Review|Medieval Review]]\\'\\' for being &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; in their approach; their decision to use Challoner\\'s 18th-century revision of the Douay-Rheims, especially in places where it imitates the King James Version, rather than producing a fresh translation into contemporary English from the Latin, despite the Challoner edition being &quot;not relevant to the Middle Ages&quot;; and the &quot;artificial&quot; nature of their Latin text which &quot;is neither a medieval text nor a critical edition of one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Marsden|first1= Richard|date= June 26, 2011|title= Edgar, The Vulgate Bible vol. 1|url= https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/article/view/17268/23386|journal= The Medieval Review|access-date= April 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bruce|first1= Scott G.|date= February 27, 2012|title= Edgar, The Vulgate Bible, Vol. II|url= https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/article/view/17488/23606|journal= The Medieval Review|access-date= April 13, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;\\n\\n==See also==\\n{{Portal|Religion|Bible|Judaism|Christianity}}\\n* [[Tyndale Bible]] (1526)\\n* [[Coverdale Bible]] (1535)\\n* [[Matthew Bible]] (1537)\\n* [[Taverner\\'s Bible]] (1539)\\n* [[Great Bible]] (1539)\\n* [[Geneva Bible]] (1560)\\n* [[Bishops\\' Bible]] (1568)\\n* [[King James Version|King James Bible]] (1611)\\n\\n== Citations ==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n== General references ==\\n* Much of the above text was taken from the article [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KtVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219 &quot;English Versions&quot;] by Sir [[Frederic G.

She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 16 December 1944, but [[World War II]] ended before she was completed, and she sat idle until construction resumed in 1948. On 26 October 1949, she was both christened \\xe2\\x80\\x94 by her sponsor, Charlotte Linn\\xc3\\xa9 Woodward, wife of [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Clark H. Woodward]], who also sponsored the [[USS Grampus (SS-207)|previous USS \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' (SS-207)]] and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]].\\n\\n==Operational history==\\n\\n===1949-1966===\\nWith her new [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]]ing equipment, which permitted her to remain submerged for periods far longer than the [[World War II]] fleet [[submarine]]s, \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' served as a prototype for the [[GUPPY]] submarines and also incorporated many features to appear later in nuclear submarines. Attached to SubDiv 61 at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], she participated in a variety of exercises along the East Coast and in the [[Caribbean Sea]], including [[torpedo]] and attack exercises, snorkeling tests and demonstrations, and antisubmarine training. \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' also did a great deal of work with the early HUK (Hunter-Killer) antisubmarine patrols, now a vital part of American defenses, to whose development she greatly contributed.\\n\\nFrom 5 January to 2 April 1955 \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' proceeded independently to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], where she &quot;showed the flag&quot; at [[Algiers]], [[Naples]], [[Barcelona]], [[Malta]], [[Beirut]], [[Monaco]], and [[Gibraltar]] before returning to Norfolk and her routine of exercises and tests, spaced with regular overhauls at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. During the late 1950s and early 1960s \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' operated out of Norfolk in the North Atlantic.\\n\\nUnder the command of Lieutenant Commander D.A. Kilmer, \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' sailed with Task Force &quot;Alfa&quot; for six weeks prior to 13 February 1964. On 3 April, she deployed with the [[US 6th Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] in the Mediterranean Sea until 3 August.\\n\\nShe operated out of the [[Virginia Capes]] until entering [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] in mid-April 1965 for overhaul. After refresher training and shakedown in the fall, \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' operated along the East Coast engaging primarily in ASW exercises.\\n\\nShe departed [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on 13 May 1966 for the eastern Atlantic and Northern European countries to participate in NATO ASW exercises. Back in Norfolk on 30 August, she resumed operations in the [[Virginia Capes]] area and [[Caribbean Sea]] until sailing 29 December to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], for repairs in the naval shipyard.

She was the sixth ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for \\'\\'Grampus griseus\\'\\', also known as [[Risso\\'s dolphin]], a member of the [[dolphin]] family [[Delphinidae]]. Her [[World War II]]  service was in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. She completed five war patrols in the following 14 months, and is credited with sinking over 45,000 tons of Japanese [[merchant shipping]] and [[warship]]s. She was declared lost with all hands in March 1943; of the twelve \\'\\'Tambor\\'\\'-class submarines, only five survived the war. She received three [[battle star]]s for her World War II service.\\n\\n==Construction and commissioning==\\n\\'\\'Grampus\\'\\'\\xe2\\x80\\xb2s [[keel]] was [[Keel-laying|laid down]] by the [[Electric Boat]] Company of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], [[Connecticut]]. She was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 23 December 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Clark H. Woodward, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 23 May 1941 at [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], Connecticut.\\n\\n==Operational history==\\n\\n===Pacific===\\n\\nAfter shakedown in [[Long Island Sound]], \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' sailed to the [[Caribbean Sea]] with {{USS|Grayback|SS-208|3}} on 8 September to conduct a modified war patrol, returning to [[New London, Connecticut]], on 28 September. The Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] found \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' undergoing post-shakedown overhaul at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], but soon ready for war on 22 December, she sailed for the Pacific, reaching Pearl Harbor on 1 February 1942, via the [[Panama Canal]] and [[Mare Island]].\\n\\nOn her first war patrol from 8 February to 4 April 1942, \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' sank an 8636-ton tanker Kaijo Maru No.2 4 March 1942, the only kill of her short career,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/2919.html Uboat net]&lt;/ref&gt; and reconnoitered [[Kwajalein]] and [[Wotje]] atolls, later the scene of bloody but successful landings. \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\'\\' second patrol en route to [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], [[Australia]], and her third patrol from that base were marred by a heavy number of antisubmarine patrol craft off [[Truk Lagoon]] and poor visibility as heavy rains haunted her path along the [[Luzon]] and [[Mindoro]] coasts.\\n\\nTaking aboard four [[Coastwatchers|coast watchers]], \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' sailed from Fremantle on 2 October 1942 for her fourth war patrol. Despite the presence of Japanese [[destroyer]]s, she landed the coast watchers on [[Vella Lavella]] and [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]] islands while conducting her patrol. This patrol, during the height of the [[Guadalcanal]] campaign, took \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' into waters teeming with Japanese men-of-war. She sighted a total of four enemy [[cruiser]]s and 79 destroyers in five different convoys. Although she conducted a series of aggressive attacks on the Japanese ships, receiving 104 depth charges for her work, \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' was not credited with sinking any ships. On 18 October 1942 \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' even scored a direct hit on the \\'\\'[[Japanese cruiser Yura|Yura]]\\'\\', but the torpedo failed to explode. She returned to Australia on 23 November.\\n\\n\\'\\'Grampus\\'\\'\\' fifth war patrol, from 14 December 1942 to 19 January 1943, took her across access lanes frequented by Japanese submarines and other ships. Air and water patrol in this area was extremely heavy and although she conducted several daring attacks on the 41 contacts she sighted, \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' again was denied a kill.\\n\\n==Sinking==\\n\\nIn company with \\'\\'Grayback\\'\\', \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' departed [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] on 11 February 1943 for her sixth war patrol, from which she failed to return; the manner of her loss still remains a mystery. Japanese [[seaplane]]s reported sinking a submarine on 18 February in \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\'\\xe2\\x80\\xb2s patrol area, but \\'\\'Grayback\\'\\' reported seeing \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' in that same area on 4 March. \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' is believed to have damaged the Japanese [[merchant ship]] \\'\\'Keiyo Maru\\'\\' (6,442 [[Gross register ton|GRT]]) on 19 February&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/2919.html Uboat.

A heavy [[oil slick]] was sighted there the following day, indicating that \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' may have been lost there in a night attack or gun battle against the destroyers. The Japanese destroyers had by then already been sunk in the [[Battle of Blackett Strait]], a night action with U.S. [[light cruiser]]s and destroyers.\\n\\nWhen repeated attempts failed to contact \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\', the submarine was declared missing and presumed lost with all hands.

Her {{convert|73|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[keel]] was laid down in 1820. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] in early August 1821. The need to suppress [[piracy]] and to maintain ships to catch slavers led to the building of five such schooners, the largest of which was \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\'.

When he called upon her commander to surrender, he was met with cannon and small arms fire. \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' answered in turn, and reduced the bogus Spaniard to a floating wreck in {{frac|3|1|2}} minutes. The brig [[Striking the colors|struck her colors]] and Lt. Gregory discovered that she was \\'\\'Palmyra\\'\\', a [[Puerto Rico]]-based pirate carrying the papers of a [[privateer]] as a subterfuge. \\'\\'[[Lloyd\\'s List]]\\'\\' named the privateer as \\'\\'Panchetta\\'\\', of 18 guns and 92 men.

However, the district judge ruled that the Africans had been illegally enslaved and must be returned to Africa. It was the government that appealed on behalf of the slaveholders, and \\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' was not needed.\\n\\n\\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' continued her duties in the protection of shipping in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] until August 1841, when she was detached from the [[Africa Squadron]] while lying at [[Boston Navy Yard]] and attached to the [[Home Squadron]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 23 January 1843.\\n\\n\\'\\'Grampus\\'\\' was last spoken to by {{USS|Madison|1832|2}} off [[St. Augustine, Florida]] on 15 March 1843.

At the age of 22 he moved to [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]] and became the rabbi of the city\\'s orthodox synagogue. He became friends with the mostly non-Orthodox Belzberg family who would help him fund the Simon Wiesenthal Center. In 1977, he moved to Los Angeles and bought a building on [[Pico Boulevard]] using a $500,000 donation from [[Samuel Belzberg]] which was matched with another half a million from Toronto-based real estate maven Joseph Tannenbaum.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat1990jul15&quot;/&gt; \\n\\nIn the building he founded a [[yeshiva]], a religious Jewish school, today known as [[Yeshiva University High Schools of Los Angeles]], and a small Holocaust museum, with Belzberg as founding chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Tycoon, philanthropist, \\'had a huge heart\\', \\'\\'National Post\\'\\', April 9, 2018, &quot;He put up the initial $ 500,000 to start the centre in 1977 and was the founding chairman.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal was convinced to bless the museum with his name. Edward Norden, writing for \\'\\'[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]\\'\\', dismissed the museum as &quot;a low-tech affair fashioned by and for Jews and holding nothing against the Gentiles back\\xe2\\x80\\x94an outsized portrait of Pius XII was given a prominent place among pictures of those who \\'didn\\'t care.\\' The message was that Jews have enemies, murderous enemies, and should look out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2009&quot;/&gt;\\n\\nHier, a skillful fundraiser, networked with the Hollywood c\\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa9brit\\xc3\\xa9, local politicians, and businessmen and raised large sums of money which he used to expand his operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2009&quot;/&gt;\\n\\n=== Museum of Tolerance ===\\n{{Further|Museum of Tolerance}}\\nIn 1985, the center was incorporated separately from the yeshiva in order to bid for state funding for the construction of a bigger Holocaust museum. This bid was vociferously opposed by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and secular Jewish organizations due to the unclear separation between the yeshiva and the center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2009&quot;/&gt; At the time, the same persons sat on the board of both the center and the yeshiva.\\n\\nAnother reason for the opposition was that Los Angeles already had a Holocaust museum; the Martyrs\\' Memorial Museum (later renamed to the [[Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust]]) and Hier\\'s bid was seen as undue competition by parts of Los Angeles Jewish community which also criticized him for exploiting the memory of the Holocaust. Fred Diament, president of the Holocaust survivor group 1939 Club who helped establish the competing Martyrs\\' Memorial, blasted the organization in an interview with the \\'\\'Los Angeles Times\\'\\' in 1985:&lt;ref name=&quot;lat1985may19&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last1=Chazanov | first1=Mathis | last2=Gladstone | first2=Mark | title=\\'Museum of Tolerance\\' : Proposed $5-Million State Grant for Wiesenthal Facility Provokes Some Concern Over Church, State Separation | website=Los Angeles Times | date=May 19, 1985 | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-05-19-me-9303-story.html | access-date=August 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; \\n{{blockquote|text=As a survivor, what aggravates me is that they collect lots of money in the name of the Holocaust.
