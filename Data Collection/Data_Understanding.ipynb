Moore began his solo career in the 1970s and achieved major success with 1979's \\\"[[Parisienne Walkways]]\\\", which is considered his [[signature song]]. During the 1980s, Moore transitioned into playing hard rock and heavy metal with varying degrees of international success. In 1990, he returned to his roots with ''[[Still Got the Blues]]'', which became the most successful album of his career. Moore continued to release new music throughout his later career, collaborating with other artists from time to time. Moore died on 6 February 2011 from a heart attack while on holiday in Spain.\\n\\nMoore was often described as a [[virtuoso]] and has been cited as an influence by many other guitar players. He was voted as one of the greatest guitarists of all time on respective lists by ''[[Total Guitar]]'' and ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Louder]]''. Irish singer-songwriter [[Bob Geldof]] said that \\\"without question, [Moore] was one of the great Irish bluesmen\\\".<ref name=\\\"BBC obituary\\\">{{cite news |title=Irish rock guitarist Gary Moore: an obituary |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12382274 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=7 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208020612/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12382274 |archive-date=8 February 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=9 September 2020}}</ref> For most of his career, Moore was heavily associated with Peter Green's famed [[Greeny (guitar)|1959 Gibson Les Paul]] guitar.

The first installment in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|franchise of the same name]], it was the [[Firsts in animation|first entirely computer-animated feature film]], as well as the first feature film from Pixar. It was directed by [[John Lasseter]] (in his feature [[directorial debut]]) and produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], from a screenplay written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] and a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. The film features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (American actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\\n\\nTaking place in a world where [[toy]]s come to life when humans are not present, the plot of ''Toy Story'' focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and a modern space cadet action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz when he becomes their owner Andy's favorite toy.\\n\\nFollowing the success of ''[[Tin Toy]]'', a [[short film]] that was released in 1988, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film that was told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \\\"edgier\\\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \\\"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\\\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced ''Toy Story'' under minor financial constraints.\\n\\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22 of that year. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\\\"Numbers\\\" /> eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the [[1995 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1995]]. The film received critical acclaim and holds a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|{{RT data|score}} approval rating]] on film aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. It was praised for the technical innovation of the 3D animation, script, Newman's score, appeal to all age groups, and voice performances (particularly Hanks and Allen); it is frequently lauded as [[List of films considered the best#Animation (shorts and features)|one of the best animated films ever made]] and, due to its status as the first computer-animated film, one of the most important films in the medium's history and film at large.<ref name=\\\"best-animation\\\" /> The film received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations\\u2014[[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (the first animated film to be nominated for the award), [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \\\"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\\\", and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\\u2014in addition to being honored with a non-competitive [[Special Achievement Academy Award]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Susan |title=How 'Toy Story' changed the face of animation, taking off 'like an explosion' |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toy-story-anniversary-20150930-story.html |access-date=September 30, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070711/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toy-story-anniversary-20150930-story.html|archive-date=October 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2005, ''Toy Story'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\", one of nine films designated in its first year of eligibility. The success of ''Toy Story'' launched a multimedia franchise. It spawned three sequels beginning with ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999), a spin-off film ''[[Lightyear (film)|Lightyear]]'' (2022), numerous [[Toy Story (franchise)#Toy Story Treats (1996)|short films]], and a planned fourth sequel. The film also had a theatrical 3D re-release in 2009 as part of a double feature with the second film.\\n\\n== Plot ==\\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->\\n\\nA group of sentient [[toys]], who pretend to be lifeless when humans are around, are preparing to move into a new house with their young owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], his infant sister [[List of Toy Story characters#Molly Davis|Molly]] and their single mother [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Mrs. Davis]]. Learning that Andy's birthday party has been unexpectedly moved to an earlier date, several toys \\u2014 including [[List of Toy Story characters#Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog (Toy Story)|Slinky Dog]], [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex the tyrannosaur]], [[Hamm (Toy Story)|Hamm the piggy bank]], and [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]] the [[porcelain doll]] \\u2014 become concerned that Andy might receive something that will replace them. To calm them, [[Sheriff Woody]], Andy's favorite toy and their ''[[de facto]]'' leader, sends [[Sarge (Toy Story)|Sarge]] and his [[Army men|green army men]] to spy on Andy's birthday party with a [[baby monitor]]. Andy receives a [[Buzz Lightyear]] [[action figure]], who believes he is an actual Space Ranger and does not know he is a toy. Buzz impresses the others with his high-tech features and becomes Andy's new favorite toy, provoking Woody's jealousy.\\n\\nTwo days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet. To ensure Andy brings him along and not Buzz, Woody tries knocking Buzz behind the desk with the [[radio-controlled car]] [[List of Toy Story characters#RC|RC]]. However, Buzz is accidentally knocked out of the bedroom window instead, and most of the other toys believe Woody has deliberately killed Buzz. Andy takes Woody with him, but Buzz furiously confronts him in the car. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind; after a further quarrel, they hitch a ride to the restaurant on a Pizza Planet delivery truck. \\n\\nAt Pizza Planet, Buzz mistakes a [[claw crane]] full of [[List of Toy Story characters#The Aliens|Little Green Men]] for a rocket, and climbs in, pursued by Woody. [[List of Toy Story characters#Phillips family|Sid Phillips]], Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor, takes the two from the crane to his house, where they encounter his [[English Bull Terrier|Bull Terrier]] [[List of Toy Story characters#Phillips family|Scud]] and his \\\"mutant\\\" toys, made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.\\n\\nBuzz, after watching a television commercial promoting him, realizes he is a toy after all. He attempts to fly but falls, breaks his arm, and suffers a mental breakdown. After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid tapes Buzz to a [[firework|rocket]], planning to blow him up the following day. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is to make Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to blow him up, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to \\\"break the rules\\\" and frighten Sid into never harming toys again.\\n\\nNow freed, Buzz and Woody pursue the Davis' [[moving truck]], but Scud attacks Woody. Buzz stays behind to fight off the dog; Woody climbs into the truck, and pushes RC out to rescue Buzz. Still thinking Woody has killed Buzz, the toys also toss him out of the truck. Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys see them and realize their mistake. RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket strapped to Buzz. Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide through the sunroof of Mrs. Davis' car, landing safely inside.\\n\\nAs the toys listen in on the [[Christmas]] gift opening in the new house, Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a [[List of Toy Story characters#Other|Mrs. Potato Head]]. Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be \\\"worse\\\" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a [[dachshund]] [[List of Toy Story characters#Buster|puppy]].\\n\\n== Voice cast ==\\n{{multiple image\\n| direction = horiztotal\\n| align = right\\n| total_width = 400\\n| footer = (left-to-right) [[Tom Hanks]] (pictured in 2016) and [[Tim Allen]] (2012), the voices of [[Woody (Toy Story)|Woody]] and [[Buzz Lightyear]] respectively\\n| image1 = Tom Hanks 2016.jpg\\n| image2 = Tim Allen 2012.jpg\\n}}\\n{{See also|List of Toy Story characters|l1=List of ''Toy Story'' characters}}\\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Woody, a [[pullstring]] [[cowboy]] doll who is Andy's favorite toy.\\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Buzz Lightyear, a Space Ranger [[action figure]], Andy's second favorite toy, and Woody's rival, who later becomes his best friend.\\n* [[Don Rickles]] as Mr. Potato Head, a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body.\\n* [[Jim Varney]] as Slinky Dog, a [[dachshund]] [[slinky]] toy.\\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Rex, a nervous green ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' figurine.\\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Hamm, a smart-talking [[piggy bank]].\\n* [[Annie Potts]] as Bo Peep, a [[Bisque doll|porcelain]] shepherdess doll and Woody's love interest.\\n* [[John Morris (American actor)|John Morris]] as Andy Davis, the toys' owner.\\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as Sid Phillips, Andy's next-door neighbor and bully, who destroys toys for fun.\\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Mrs. Davis, Andy and Molly's single mother.\\n* [[R.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988, Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', which was told from the perspective of a toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[61st Academy Awards|1989 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\\n\\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]], CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]], sought to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \\\"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\\\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film. {{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney film outside the studio.

They later learned that while Katzenberg was pushing the idea of working with Pixar, Schneider did not want to bring in a non-Disney animation studio. Katzenberg arranged to meet directly with the Pixar contingent, this time including Lasseter and Jobs. The Pixar team proposed a [[List of United States Christmas television specials|Christmas television special]], ''A Tin Toy Christmas'', as a first step, but Katzenberg countered that as long as they were gearing up to transition from 30-second commercials to a half-hour special, they might as well go all the way and make a feature-length film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\\n\\nKatzenberg also made it clear that he was only working with Pixar to get access to Lasseter's talents,{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} and that the Pixar team would be signing up to work with a self-described \\\"tyrant\\\" and micro-manager.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} However, he invited them to talk with Disney's animators and get their opinions on working under him and Lasseter was impressed with what he heard.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} The two companies began negotiations, although they disagreed on key points including whether Disney would get the rights to Pixar's animation technology{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} or whether Pixar would retain partial ownership of the films, characters, and home video and sequel rights.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} As Pixar was nearing bankruptcy and desperate for funds,{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} they settled on a deal that would allow Disney to have complete ownership and control of the films and characters, including the rights to make sequels without Pixar's involvement, while Pixar would get approximately 12.5% of ticket sales.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\\\"BizWeekBOX\\\" /> These early negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}\\n\\nAn agreement to produce a feature film based on ''Tin Toy'' with a working title of ''Toy Story'' was finalized, and production began soon thereafter.<ref name=\\\"PixMagicMan\\\">{{cite news |last=Schlender |first=Brent |url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm |title=Pixar's magic man |date=May 17, 2006 |publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]] |access-date=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715081233/http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Writing ===\\nOriginally, ''Toy Story'' was going to feature \\\"Tinny\\\", the wind-up one-man band toy from the ''Tin Toy'' short film, along with \\\"the dummy\\\", a [[ventriloquist's dummy]]. While the film's premise was still about toys' desire to be played with by children, the rest of the film's script, which involved Tinny being left behind at a gas station, meeting up with the dummy, and having a series of adventures before finding their way into a kindergarten classroom where they can be played with every day, was quite different.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=121}} Katzenberg was unhappy with the [[Film treatment|treatment]] drafted by Lasseter, [[Andrew Stanton]], and [[Pete Docter]], as the two character's motivations were too similar. Instead, he encouraged them to write it as a [[buddy film]], giving the two main characters contrasting personalities, and having them only become friends after being forced to work together.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter delivered a revised treatment in September 1991 that more closely resembles the final version of the film: Tinny replaces the ventriloquist dummy as a child's favorite toy, their bickering causes them to be left behind at a gas station, they almost catch up to the family at a pizza restaurant, they have to escape a kid that mutilates toys, and the movie ends with a chase scene as the two toys try to catch up to the family's moving van.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}}\\n\\nThe script went through many changes before the final version of it. Lasseter decided Tinny was \\\"too antiquated\\\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure in the likes of ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' and was then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually [[Buzz Lightyear]] (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as the aforementioned ''G.I.

Convergent evolution creates '''analogous structures''' that have similar form or function but were not present in the [[last common ancestor]] of those groups. The [[cladistic]] term for the same phenomenon is [[Cladogram#Homoplasies|homoplasy]]. The [[recurrent evolution]] of flight is a classic example, as flying [[pterygota|insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[pterosaurs]], and [[bat]]s have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are ''analogous'', whereas ''[[homology (biology)|homologous]]'' structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions.  Bird, bat, and pterosaur [[wings]] are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions.\\n\\nThe opposite of convergence is [[divergent evolution]], where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution is similar to [[parallel evolution]], which occurs when two independent species evolve in the same direction and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, [[flying frog|gliding frog]]s have evolved in parallel from multiple types of [[tree frog]].\\n\\nMany instances of convergent evolution are known in [[plant]]s, including the repeated development of [[C4 photosynthesis|C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis]], [[seed dispersal]] by fleshy [[fruit]]s adapted to be eaten by animals, and [[carnivorous plant|carnivory]].\\n\\n==Overview==\\n[[File:Analogous & Homologous Structures.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Homology (biology)|Homology]] and analogy in mammals and insects: on the horizontal axis, the structures are homologous in morphology, but different in function due to differences in habitat.

From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene ([[genetic drift|selectively neutral]]) has a steadily decreasing [[probability]] of retaining potential functionality over time.

Her design differed from previous aircraft carriers. ''Ark Royal'' was the first ship on which the hangars and [[flight deck]] were an integral part of the hull, instead of an add-on or part of the [[wikt:superstructure|superstructure]]. Designed to carry a large number of aircraft, she had two hangar deck levels. She was used during a period that first saw the extensive use of naval air power; several carrier tactics were developed and refined aboard ''Ark Royal''.\\n\\n''Ark Royal'' operated in some of the most active naval theatres of the Second World War. She was involved in the first aerial U-boat kills of the war, [[Allied campaign in Norway|operations off Norway]], the [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|search for the German battleship]] {{Ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, and the [[Malta Convoys]]. ''Ark Royal'' survived several near misses and gained a reputation as a 'lucky ship'. She was torpedoed on 13 November 1941 by the {{GS|U-81|1941|6}} and sank the following day. One of her 1,488 crew members was killed. Her sinking was the subject of several inquiries, with investigators keen to know how the carrier was lost in spite of efforts to save the ship and tow her to the naval base at [[Gibraltar]]. They found that several design flaws contributed to the loss, which were rectified in new British carriers.\\n\\nThe wreck was discovered in December 2002 by an American underwater survey company using sonar mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle, under contract from the [[BBC]] for the filming of a documentary about the ship, at a depth of about {{convert|1000|m|order=flip}} and approximately {{convert|30|nmi|lk=in}} from Gibraltar.\\n\\n==Design==\\nIn 1923, the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]] prepared a 10-year building programme which included an aircraft carrier and 300&nbsp;aircraft for the [[Fleet Air Arm]].<ref name=\\\"Rossiter\\\">{{cite book |last=Rossiter |title=Ark Royal |pages=43\\u201344}}</ref> The economic downturn following the First World War caused it to be postponed. In 1930, the [[Director of Naval Construction]], [[Arthur Johns (naval architect)|Sir Arthur Johns]], began to update the plans for the carrier by incorporating recently developed technology.<ref name=\\\"Rossiter\\\"/> His aim was to increase the number of aircraft carried by shortening the landing and take-off distances of aircraft using [[Arresting gear|arrestor gear]] and [[Aircraft catapult|compressed steam catapults]] respectively, which would make more deck space available for storage and aircraft preparation.<ref name=\\\"Rossiter\\\"/><ref name=BisChant/> Along with the inclusion of two hangar decks, this allowed ''Ark Royal'' to carry up to 72&nbsp;aircraft, although the development of larger and heavier aircraft during the carrier's construction meant that the actual number carried was between 50 and 60.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rossiter |title=Ark Royal |pages=48\\u201351}}</ref> ''Ark Royal'' featured an enclosed hangar design<ref>Friedman. When the flight deck becomes the strength deck, the aircraft hangars are then enclosed within the hull structure. The terms, 'enclosed' and 'open' hangars do not, strictly speaking, refer to a hangar that is closed or open on the sides, but rather to whether the hangar is, respectively, below or above the strength deck.</ref> where the flight deck was the 'strength deck'<ref>Friedman. The flight deck was designed with .75 in of Ducol steel. The enclosed hangar design required a deck of approximately this thickness to ensure adequate hull integrity, so the limited armour protection was a by-product of the enclosed hangar design. The strength deck is designed to carry structural loading in combination with the hull girder and side and bottom plating. Ship's structure above the strength deck is termed 'superstructure'. Ducol steel was an advanced type of high tensile steel which had great strength and was often used to provide armour for splinter protection.</ref> and was strongly built with .75in (19mm) thick [[Ducol]] steel plating. The two hangar decks were thus enclosed within the hull girder, which also gave splinter protection to the hangars. The machinery spaces were protected by {{convert|4.5|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[belt armour]].<ref name=BisChant/> Three lifts moved aircraft between the hangars and the flight deck.<ref name=BisChant/>\\n\\n[[File:HMS Ark Royal 19sb2j1.jpg|thumb|left|''Ark Royal''{{'}}s flight deck overhung the stern.

As a result, comprehensive [[Damage control (maritime)|damage control measures]] were not initiated until 49&nbsp;minutes after the attack.

This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: ''Ark Royal'' depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised.

Originally released on May 5, 1992, for [[DOS]], it was inspired by the 1981 [[Muse Software]] video game ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', and is the third installment in the ''[[Wolfenstein]]'' series. In ''Wolfenstein 3D'', the player [[player character|assumes the role]] of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] spy [[William \\\"B.J.\\\" Blazkowicz]] during [[World War&nbsp;II]] as he escapes from the [[Nazi German]] prison Castle Wolfenstein and carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis. The player traverses each of the game's [[level (video games)|levels]] to find an elevator to the next level or kill a [[boss (video games)|final boss]], fighting Nazi soldiers, dogs, and other enemies with a knife and a variety of guns.\\n\\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the second major independent release by id Software, after the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series of episodes. In mid-1991, programmer [[John Carmack]] experimented with making a fast 3D [[game engine]] by restricting the gameplay and viewpoint to a single [[plane (geometry)|plane]], producing ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'' and ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]'' as prototypes. After a design session prompted the company to shift from the family-friendly ''Keen'' to a more violent theme, programmer [[John Romero]] suggested remaking the 1981 stealth shooter ''Castle Wolfenstein'' as a fast-paced action game. He and designer [[Tom Hall]] designed the game, built on Carmack's engine, to be fast and violent, unlike other computer games on the market at the time. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' features artwork by [[Adrian Carmack]] and sound effects and music by [[Bobby Prince]]. The game was released through Apogee in two sets of three episodes under the [[shareware]] model, in which the first episode is released for free to drive interest in paying for the rest. An additional episode, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a stand-alone retail title through FormGen.\\n\\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was a critical and commercial success and is considered one of the [[greatest video games ever made]]. It garnered numerous awards and sold over 250,000 copies by the end of 1995. It has been termed the \\\"grandfather of 3D shooters\\\", and is widely regarded as having helped popularize the first-person shooter genre and establishing the standard of fast-paced action and technical prowess for many subsequent games in the genre, as well as showcasing the viability of the shareware publishing model at the time. FormGen developed an additional two episodes for the game, while Apogee released a pack of over 800 fan-created levels. Id Software never returned to the series, but did license the engine to numerous other titles before releasing the source code for free in 1995, and multiple other games in the ''Wolfenstein'' series have been developed by other companies since 2001.\\n\\n==Gameplay==\\n[[File:Wolf3d pc.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot of the DOS version, showing the player character firing a submachine gun at guards|alt=A submachine gun firing at a falling brown-uniformed Nazi, while a second Nazi aims a pistol at the viewer]]\\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is a [[first-person shooter]] presented with rudimentary [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]]. The game is broken up into [[level (video games)|levels]], each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height.<ref name=\\\"CarmackComm\\\"/> Each level is themed after [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator.<ref name=\\\"Dragon197\\\"/> Levels\\u2014ten in the original episodes\\u2014are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a [[boss (video games)|boss fight]] with a particularly difficult enemy.<ref name=\\\"HG101\\\"/> While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and [[health (game terminology)|health]]. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a knife, a pistol, a submachine gun, and a rapid-fire [[chain gun]].<ref name=\\\"Dragon197\\\"/> The player can also find keys that allow them to pass through locked doors. While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as [[2.5D]] graphics.<ref name=\\\"MOD8793\\\"/>\\n\\nThe player's health is represented by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies.<ref name=\\\"Dragon192\\\"/> If the player's health falls to zero, they lose one [[life (video games)|life]] and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets.<ref name=\\\"Dragon197\\\"/> The player begins each episode with four lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels.<ref name=\\\"Dragon192\\\"/> Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition can be found in hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered.<ref name=\\\"HG101\\\"/> The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its [[porting|ports]] the player can only save between levels.<ref name=\\\"Dragon197\\\"/><ref name=\\\"HG101\\\"/>\\n\\n==Plot==\\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' is divided into two sets of three episodes: \\\"Escape from Castle Wolfenstein\\\", \\\"Operation: Eisenfaust\\\", and \\\"Die, F\\u00fchrer, Die!\\\" serve as the primary trilogy, with a second trilogy titled ''The Nocturnal Missions'' including \\\"A Dark Secret\\\", \\\"Trail of the Madman\\\", and \\\"Confrontation\\\". The protagonist is [[William \\\"B.J.\\\" Blazkowicz]], an American spy of [[Polish Americans|Polish descent]], and the game follows his efforts to destroy the Nazi regime. In \\\"Escape\\\", Blazkowicz has been captured while trying to find the plans for Operation Eisenfaust (Iron Fist) and imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, from which he must escape. \\\"Operation: Eisenfaust\\\" follows his discovery and thwarting of the Nazi plan to create an army of [[undead]] mutants in Castle Hollehammer, while in \\\"Die, F\\u00fchrer, Die!\\\" he infiltrates a [[F\\u00fchrerbunker|bunker]] under the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]], culminating in a battle with [[Adolf Hitler]] in a [[powered exoskeleton|robotic suit]] equipped with four [[chain gun]]s.\\n\\n''The Nocturnal Missions'' form a [[prequel]] storyline dealing with German plans for [[chemical warfare]]. \\\"A Dark Secret\\\" deals with the initial pursuit through a weapons research facility of the scientist responsible for developing the weaponry. \\\"Trail of the Madman\\\" takes place in Castle [[Erlangen]], where Blazkowicz's goal is to find the maps and plans for the chemical war. The story ends in \\\"Confrontation\\\", which is set in Castle [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]] as he confronts the Nazi general behind the chemical warfare initiative.\\n\\n===Spear of Destiny===\\nAn additional episode, titled ''Spear of Destiny'', was released as a retail game by [[FormGen]]. It follows Blazkowicz on a different prequel mission, trying to recapture the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] from the Nazis after it was stolen from [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. FormGen later developed two sequel episodes, \\\"Return to Danger\\\" and \\\"Ultimate Challenge\\\", each of which feature Blazkowicz as he fights through another Nazi base to recover the Spear of Destiny after it has been stolen again as part of a plot to [[German nuclear weapons program|build a nuclear weapon]] or [[evocation|summon demons]].\\n\\n==Development==\\n[[File:Simple raycasting with fisheye correction.gif|thumb|300px|right|A simple [[ray casting]] rendering similar to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine.

The orange area represents the player's [[field of view]].|alt=A rotating view of a complex 3D area, with an overhead view on the right showing the raycasting area as the view rotates]]\\nIn October\\u2013December 1990, a team of employees from programming studio [[Softdisk]] calling themselves Ideas from the Deep developed the three-part video game ''[[Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons]]'', the first game in the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series. The group, who worked at Softdisk in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], developing games for the ''Gamer's Edge'' video game subscription service and [[disk magazine]], was composed of programmers [[John Romero]] and [[John Carmack]], designer [[Tom Hall]], artist [[Adrian Carmack]], and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of the game in December through [[shareware]] publisher [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]], the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, confronted them on both their plans and their use of company resources to develop the game\\u2014the team had created it on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends\\u2014the team made no secret of their intentions. After a few weeks of negotiation, the team agreed to produce a series of games for ''Gamer's Edge'', one every two months.<ref name=\\\"MOD6676\\\"/>\\n\\nIdeas from the Deep, now formally established as [[id Software]], used some of these to prototype ideas for their own games.<ref name=\\\"IGNid\\\"/> Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with [[3D computer graphics]], which until then was largely the purview of [[amateur flight simulation|flight simulation games]] such as ''[[Wing Commander (video game)|Wing Commander]]'' (1990) or [[wire-frame model|wireframe]] 3D in games on [[mainframe computer]]s. Carmack found that this was largely due to the limitations of [[personal computer]]s of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast [[action game]] in 3D due to the [[rendering (computer graphics)|number of surfaces]] it needed to calculate, but felt that the increasing computational power of PCs meant that it may be possible.<ref name=\\\"MOD6676\\\"/><ref name=\\\"AM386\\\"/> During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through [[ray casting]], in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D [[game engine]] that used animated 2D [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'', in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters.<ref name=\\\"CarmackComm\\\"/><ref name=\\\"MOD6676\\\"/> In the fall of 1991, after the team\\u2014sans Wilbur\\u2014had relocated to [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and he had largely finished the engine work for ''[[Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy]]'', Carmack decided to implement a feature from ''[[Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss]]'', a [[role-playing video game|role-playing game]] in development by [[Looking Glass Studios|Blue Sky Productions]].<ref name=\\\"MOD7786\\\"/> ''Ultima Underworld'' was planned to display [[texture mapping|texture-mapped]] 3D graphics without ''Hovertank''{{'}}s restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting.<ref name=\\\"MOD7786\\\"/><ref name=\\\"UU\\\"/><ref name=\\\"UU2\\\"/> Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as ''Underworld'' was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from ''Hovertank 3D'' for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 ''[[Catacomb 3-D]]''.<ref name=\\\"CarmackComm\\\"/><ref name=\\\"MOD7786\\\"/> Upon seeing it, [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.<ref name=\\\"MOD7786\\\"/>\\n\\n[[File:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Romero]] in 2012|alt=Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses]]\\nIn November 1991, with the second ''Commander Keen'' trilogy of episodes nearing completion and their contractual obligations to Softdisk almost finished, id Software sat down to plan out their next major game. Designer Tom Hall, who initially wanted to do a third ''Keen'' trilogy, recognized that Carmack's programming focus had shifted from the 2D [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] series to 3D action games. After an initial proposal by Hall of a sci-fi project, \\\"It's Green and Pissed\\\", Romero suggested a 3D remake of the 1981 ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]''. The team was interested in the idea, as Romero, Hall, and John Carmack all had fond memories of the original title and felt the maze-like shooter gameplay fit well with Carmack's 3D game engine, while Adrian Carmack was interested in moving away from the child-friendly art style of ''Keen'' into something more violent. Encouraged by the reception to his idea, Romero expounded on it by proposing a \\\"loud\\\" and \\\"cool\\\" fast action game where the player could shoot soldiers before dragging and looting their bodies. The core of the gameplay would be fast and simple, for Romero believed that due to the novelty of a 3D game and control scheme, players would not be receptive to more complicated, slow gameplay.<ref name=\\\"RomeroComm\\\"/> He felt the game would occupy a unique place in the industry, which was then dominated by slower simulation and strategy games. Adrian and John Carmack were excited by the prospect, while Hall felt that it was enjoyable enough, and that since he was the company's designer that they could return to his ideas at a later date.<ref name=\\\"MOD8793\\\"/>\\n\\nInitially the team believed that they would be unable to use the ''Wolfenstein'' name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles.<ref name=\\\"MOD94104\\\"/> They contacted ''Castle Wolfenstein'' developer [[Silas Warner]], but learned that [[Muse Software]] had shut down in 1986, with all rights to ''Wolfenstein'' sold.<ref name=\\\"DawnFPS\\\"/> The rights last belonged to someone in [[Michigan]],<ref name=\\\"IDInterview\\\"/> and the team was able to purchase the trademark around mid-April 1992 for US$5,000.<ref name=\\\"WolfensteinRights\\\"/> Thus they were free to use the name ''Wolfenstein 3D''.<ref name=\\\"lombardi199407\\\"/> The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he guaranteed id a US$100,000 payment on the project.<ref name=\\\"MOD7786\\\"/> [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]], who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail ''Wolfenstein'' project to [[FormGen]], which had published id's December 1991 ''[[Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter]]'', overcoming the publisher's concerns over ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.<ref name=\\\"MOD94104\\\"/>\\n\\n[[File:John Carmack E3 2006.jpg|thumb|[[John Carmack]] in 2006|alt=Black and white photo of the head and shoulders of a man wearing glasses]]\\nThe project officially began on December 15, 1991.<ref name=\\\"IDInterview\\\"/> Romero and Hall designed the gameplay and aesthetics. Romero wanted the goal to be \\\"to mow down Nazis\\\", with the suspense of storming a Nazi bunker full of [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] soldiers and Hitler himself, as well as dogs, blood \\\"like you never see in games\\\", and straightforward, lethal weapons. He also composed the general storyline for the game.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-JagDev\\\"/> Hall designed the levels while also adding collectible objects in the form of treasure and food for health items.<ref name=\\\"MOD94104\\\"/> He also did sketches for the bosses and the title screen.<ref name=\\\"Gamasutra-CKTech\\\"/> Carmack programmed \\\"the core\\\" of the game's engine in a month; he added a few features to the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'', including support for doors and decorative non-wall objects, but primarily focused on making the game run smoother and faster with higher-resolution graphics.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-Jag\\\"/><ref name=\\\"CarmackComm\\\"/><ref name=\\\"MOD94104\\\"/> The game was programmed chiefly in [[ANSI C]], with its scaling and ray casting routines written in [[assembly language|assembly]].<ref name=\\\"IDInterview\\\"/> The graphics for the game were planned to be in 16 color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], but were changed to 256 color [[VGA]] four months before release, which also enabled the game to have higher resolutions.<ref name=\\\"GSMillerInt\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Gamasutra-EduFeature\\\"/> Romero in turn worked on building a game with the engine, removing elements of the initial design, like looting enemy bodies, that he felt interrupted the flow of fast gameplay.<ref name=\\\"MOD94104\\\"/> The sprites for the enemies and objects were hand drawn at eight different angles by Adrian Carmack using [[Electronic Arts]]'s ''[[Deluxe Paint|Deluxe Paint II]]''.<ref name=\\\"Gamasutra-EduFeature\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-BitTech\\\"/><ref name=\\\"DeluxePaintII\\\"/> Initially the team had an external artist who assisted him and created animated wall textures, but the team felt that the quality was poor and did not use it in the game.<ref name=\\\"GamasutraWalls\\\"/> The level design, by Romero and Hall, due to the grid-based level design, took some inspiration from ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and paid homage with a hidden ''Pac-Man'' level.<ref name=\\\"Pacman\\\"/> Romero later said in 2017 that making the levels was uninteresting compared to those from ''Commander Keen'' and had to prompt Hall to finish the maps with the promise of being able to buy himself a brand new car.<ref name=\\\"BoringLevels\\\"/><ref name=\\u201cPCGamer-Wolf3DHistory\\u201d/> The team was going to include some anti-fascist references and Nazi atrocities, but left them out to avoid controversies.<ref name=\\\"WaysideIdeas\\\"/> They ensured that the presentation of the game created the atmosphere that they wanted, adding violent animations by Adrian Carmack for enemies being shot and music and sound effects by ''Keen'' composer [[Bobby Prince]] to make the guns sound exciting.<ref name=\\\"MOD94104\\\"/> Prince took some inspiration from his days as a platoon soldier in the US Army.<ref name=\\\"PrinceArmy\\\"/> With the aid of a 16-bit sampler keyboard and cassette recorder, he composed realistic sounds from a shooting range in addition to [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] sounds. The development team along with Scott Miller did the voicing for the enemies.<ref name=\\\"SFXGamasutra\\\"/> Some of the enemy shouts were based on the original ''Castle Wolfenstein'' game.<ref name=\\\"DawnFPS\\\"/>\\n\\nAs development continued, id Software hired their former Softdisk liaison [[Kevin Cloud]] as an assistant artist, and moved the company out to [[Mesquite, Texas]], near where Apogee was located.<ref name=\\\"MOD94104\\\"/> Scott Miller of Apogee was pleased to have his star developers nearby, and agreed to not only increase their [[royalty payment|royalty]] rate to 50 percent, but have Apogee create their next game for Softdisk, ''ScubaVenture'', so that id could focus on ''Wolfenstein''. The game was intended to be released using Apogee's shareware model of splitting it into three episodes and releasing the first for free, with ten levels per episode.<ref name=\\\"MOD105112\\\"/> The level maps were designed in 2D using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which had been used for the entire ''Keen'' series as well as several other games.<ref name=\\\"TE5GameUltra\\\"/> Upon finding out that the team was able to create a level in a single day using the program, Miller convinced them to instead develop six episodes, which could be sold in different-sized packs.<ref name=\\\"CarmackComm\\\"/><ref name=\\\"MOD105112\\\"/> Around the same time, the team changed members and structure: id fired probationary president Mark Rein and brought back Jay Wilbur, who had stayed in Shreveport, to be both their CEO and business team; Bobby Prince moved into the office temporarily to record sound effects, while Adrian Carmack moved out of the office to get away from the noise.<ref name=\\\"MOD105112\\\"/>\\n\\nAs the game neared completion, FormGen contacted id with concerns over its violence and shock content. In response, id increased these aspects; Adrian Carmack added skeletons, corpses, and bloody wall details, and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German, along with a Death Cam that would show a replay of the death of the final boss of an episode. The team also added \\\"[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]\\\", the anthem of the [[Nazi Party]], to the opening screen. John Carmack, meanwhile, added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas, a feature that Hall had been pushing for months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons. Hall also added in cheat codes, and wrote a back story for the game. The team did a month of playtesting in the final stage of the game's development.<ref name=\\\"IDInterview\\\"/> In the early morning of May 5, 1992, the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to [[bulletin board system]]s. The other episodes were completed a few weeks later. The total development time had been around half a year, with a cost of around US$25,000 to cover the team's rent and US$750 per month salaries,<ref name=\\\"MOD113117\\\"/> plus around US$6,500 for the computer John Carmack used to develop the engine and the US$5,000 to get the ''Wolfenstein'' trademark.<ref name=\\\"DawnFPS\\\"/>\\n\\nThe following summer, most of the id Software team developed ''Spear of Destiny''. The single-episode game was a prequel to ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and used the same engine, but added new audio, graphics, and enemies. It was created in two months, and was published commercially by FormGen in September 1992.<ref name=\\\"SOD-Doom\\\"/><ref name=\\\"SOD-Romero\\\"/><ref name=\\\"SOD-5YearsDoom\\\"/> The publisher was concerned that the material would be controversial due to holy relics associated with World War{{nbsp}}II, but Romero felt it was similar to the Indiana Jones films.<ref name=\\\"ShootNazisInWolf3D\\\"/> Instead of working on the game, John Carmack experimented with a new graphics engine that was licensed for ''[[Shadowcaster]]'' and became the basis of the [[Doom engine|engine]] for id's next game, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993).<ref name=\\\"SOD-Doom\\\"/>\\n\\n==Release==\\nThe first episode was released as shareware for free distribution by Apogee and the whole original trilogy of episodes made available for purchase on May 5 as ''Wolfenstein 3D'', though the purchased episodes were not actually shipped to customers until a few weeks later. The second trilogy that Miller had convinced id to create was released soon after as an add-on pack titled ''The Nocturnal Missions''.<ref name=\\\"MOD113117\\\"/> Players were able to buy each trilogy separately or as a single game.<ref name=\\\"TUH\\\"/> In 1993 Apogee also published the ''Wolfenstein 3D Super Upgrades'' pack, which included 815 fan-made levels called \\\"WolfMaster\\\", along with a map editor titled \\\"MapEdit\\\" and a random level generator named \\\"Wolf Creator\\\".<ref name=\\\"3DRlegacy\\\"/><ref name=\\\"SuperWolfUpgrade\\\"/> A retail ''Wolfenstein'' episode double the length of the Apogee episodes, ''Spear of Destiny'', was released through FormGen on September 18, 1992. FormGen later published two mission packs titled \\\"Return to Danger\\\" and \\\"Ultimate Challenge\\\", each the same length as ''Spear of Destiny'', in May 1994, and later that year published ''Spear of Destiny'' and the two mission packs together as the ''Spear of Destiny Super CD Package''. Id released the original six Apogee episodes as a retail title through [[GT Interactive|GT Software]] in 1993 and produced a collection of both the Apogee and FormGen episodes released through [[Activision]] in 1998.<ref name=\\\"Apogee FAQ\\\"/>\\n\\nThere were two intended promotions associated with the original Apogee release, both of which were cancelled. A pushable wall maze led to a sign reading \\\"Call Apogee and say [[Aardwolf]]\\\" (\\\"Snapity\\\" in beta versions);<ref name=\\\"IDInterview\\\"/><ref name=\\\"JoeSigCall\\\"/> it was intended that the first person to find the sign and carry out its instructions would win a prize (consisting of US$1,000 or a line of Apogee games for life),<ref name=\\\"IDInterview\\\"/><ref name=\\\"JoeSigCall\\\"/> but the quick creation of level editors and [[cheating in video games|cheat]] programs for the game soon after release led id and Apogee to give up on the idea. Additionally, after completing an episode the player is given a three-letter code in addition to their total score and time. This code was intended to be a verification code as part of a high-score contest, but the sudden prevalence of editor programs resulted in the cancellation of the contest without ever being formally announced.<ref name=\\\"Aardwolf\\\"/>\\n\\n[[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]] bought the rights for the game,<ref name=\\\"SNESRights\\\"/> and commissioned id to port the game to the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) for a US$100,000 advance. The team was busy with the [[development of Doom|development of ''Doom'']], plus their work on ''Spear of Destiny'',<ref name=\\\"Romero-PortWolf3D\\\"/> and ignored the project for seven or eight months, finally hiring [[Rebecca Heineman]] to do the work.<ref name=\\\"wolf3d-Terraform\\\"/><ref name=\\\"GDC2011\\\"/><ref name=\\\"RomeroGDC\\\"/> She made no progress on the port, however, and the id team members instead spent three weeks frantically learning how to make SNES games and creating the port by March 1993.<ref name=\\\"wolf3d-Terraform\\\"/> This version was written in C and compiled in the 65816 assembly language, making use of [[binary space partitioning]] rather than raycasting in order to give it speed.<ref name=\\\"Romero-PortWolf3D\\\"/><ref name=\\\"scarydarkfast43-44\\\"/> Carmack had to resize existing images to fit the SNES resolution.<ref name=\\\"Romero-PortWolf3D\\\"/> [[Nintendo]] insisted on censoring the game in accordance with their policies; this included first making all blood green and then finally removing it, removing Nazi imagery and German voice clips, and replacing enemy dogs with giant rats.<ref name=\\\"wolf3d-Terraform\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-JagPlay\\\"/> The port was released in Japan on February 10, 1994, under the name ''Wolfenstein 3D: The Claw of Eisenfaust'' before being released in North America and Europe later that year.<ref name=\\\"WolfenJP\\\"/> Using the source code of the SNES port, on a whim John Carmack later converted the game to run on the [[Atari Jaguar]]. [[Atari Corporation]] approved the conversion for publication and Carmack spent three weeks, assisted by [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]], improving the port's graphics and quality to what he later claimed was four times more detail than the DOS version. He also removed the changes that Nintendo had insisted on.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-Jag\\\"/> The game itself, however, had to be slowed down to work properly on the console.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-JagPlay\\\"/>\\n\\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' has also been ported to numerous other platforms.<ref name=\\\"GameFan2-6\\\"/> In 1993, Alternate Worlds Technology licensed ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and converted it into a [[virtual reality]] arcade game.<ref name=\\\"VR-Wolf3D\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-AVT\\\"/> The 1994 Acorn Archimedes port was done in UK by programmer Eddie Edwards and published by Powerslave Software.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-RISC\\\"/><ref name=\\\"wolfencorn\\\"/> By 1994, a port for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive]] was under development by [[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]], who intended to release it by September, but it was cancelled due to technical problems.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-MDrive\\\"/><ref name=\\\"SFus5\\\"/> The 1994 [[Classic Mac OS]] version of the game had three releases: ''The First Encounter'', a shareware release; ''The Second Encounter'', with 30 exclusive levels; and ''The Third Encounter'', with all 60 levels from the DOS version.<ref name=\\\"MacWolf\\\"/> An [[Atari Lynx]] version of the game was offered earlier by Atari for id, but work on the port was never started, save for a few images.<ref name=\\\"Romero-PortWolf3D\\\"/><ref name=\\\"LynxUG\\\"/><ref name=\\\"LynxPodcast\\\"/> A [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] version was released in October 1995.<ref name=\\\"wolfen3do\\\"/><ref name=\\\"WolfenJP3DO\\\"/> The Apple IIGS port was started in Fall 1994 by Vitesse with Heineman as the initial developer, with later graphics assistance by Ninjaforce Entertainment, but due to licensing problems with id it was not released until February 1998.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-GSII\\\"/><ref name=\\\"NinjaForce\\\"/><ref name=\\\"SheppyWare\\\"/> An open source [[iOS]] port programmed by John Carmack himself was released in 2009.<ref name=\\\"CarmackComm\\\"/><ref name=\\\"wolfenios\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-iOS\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-OpenSource\\\"/> An unofficial port for the [[Game Boy Color]] was made in 2016.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-GBC\\\"/> An Android port titled ''Wolfenstein 3D Touch'' (later renamed ''ECWolf'') was released and published by Beloko Games.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3D-Android\\\"/> Other releases include the [[Game Boy Advance]] (2002), [[Xbox Live Arcade]], and [[PlayStation Network]].<ref name=\\\"wolfengba\\\"/><ref name=\\\"wolfenxbla\\\"/><ref name=\\\"wolfenpsn\\\"/> These ports' sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the original. Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes ''Spear of Destiny'', and a 2007 [[Steam (service)|Steam]] release for PC, macOS, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes.<ref name=\\\"wolfenios\\\"/><ref name=\\\"wolfensteam\\\"/> [[Bethesda Softworks]], whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of ''Wolfenstein 3D''{{'}}s release by producing a free-to-play [[browser game|browser-based]] version of the game in 2012, though the website was removed a few years later.<ref name=\\\"wolfenbrowse\\\"/>\\n\\n==Reception==\\nId had no clear expectations for ''Wolfenstein''{{'}}s commercial reception, but hoped that it would make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000.<ref name=\\\"MOD113117\\\"/> The game was selling at a rate of 4,000 copies a month by mail order.<ref name=\\\"PrimaGames\\\"/> ''[[PC Zone]]'' quoted a shareware distributor as saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was the top shareware seller of 1992.<ref name=\\\"PCZ\\\"/> By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' as well as ''Spear of Destiny'' had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly by the end of the year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space.<ref name=\\\"GamasutraDoom\\\"/> By mid-1994 150,000 shareware copies were registered and id Software had sold another 150,000 retail copies of ''Spear of Destiny''; the company estimated that one million shareware copies were distributed worldwide.<ref name=\\\"lombardi199407\\\"/> Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|banned from sale in Germany]] due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols by the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] in 1994, and again in 1997 for ''Spear of Destiny''.<ref name=\\\"MOD113117\\\"/><ref name=\\\"GamasutraDoom\\\"/><ref name=\\\"GamasutraBPS\\\"/> Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed the game five months after release, describing it as: \\\"View from the character's point of view: It's a real shooter. The game is easy to play, and it runs well ... This is the only game of its type.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Famitsu\\\"/> The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier ''Commander Keen'' series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart; where ''Commander Keen'' games were bringing Apogee around $10,000 a month, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' averaged $200,000 per month for the first year and a half.<ref name=\\\"GamasutraDoom\\\"/><ref name=\\\"20YearsGameUltra\\\"/> The game sold 250,000 copies by 1995 and grossed $2.5 million in revenue.<ref name=\\\"1995Sales\\\"/>\\n\\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' won the 1992 Best Arcade game award from ''[[Compute!]]'', the 1992 Most Innovative Game and Best Action Game awards from ''[[VideoGames & Computer Entertainment]]'', the 1992 Reader's Choice&nbsp;\\u2014 Action/Arcade Game award from ''Game Bytes'', the 1993 Best Action/Arcade Game, Best Entertainment Software, and People's Choice awards at the [[Shareware Industry Awards]], the 1993 Best Action Game award from ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', and a [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]] from the [[Software Publishers Association]] for Best Action/Arcade Game.<ref name=\\\"3DRlegacy\\\"/><ref name=\\\"SIAaward\\\"/><ref name=\\\"scarydarkfast11\\\"/><ref name=\\\"CGW106\\\"/><ref name=\\\"CGW111\\\"/> It was the first shareware title to win a Codie, and id (with six employees) became the smallest company to ever receive the award. ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was noted as one of the top games of the year at the 1993 [[Game Developers Conference]].<ref name=\\\"CGW108\\\"/>\\n\\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' was well received by reviewers upon its release. Chris Lombardi of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' praised the \\\"sparse [but] gorgeous\\\", \\\"frighteningly realistic\\\", and \\\"extremely violent\\\" graphics, as well as the immersive sound and music. Noting the violence, he warned \\\"those sensitive to such things to stay home\\\". Lombardi concluded that ''Wolfenstein 3D'', alongside ''Ultima Underworld'' released two months prior, was \\\"the first game technologically capable of creating a sufficient element of disbelief\\u2013suspension to emotionally immerse the player in a threatening environment\\\", stating that they knew of no other game that could \\\"evoke such intense psychological responses from its players\\\".<ref name=\\\"CGW98\\\"/> ''Wolfenstein'' twice received 5 out of 5 stars in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' in 1993; Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser termed it \\\"definitely one of the best arcade games ever created for PC\\\", highly praised the graphics and sound, and said that the \\\"fast-paced action\\\" could keep players enthralled for weeks if they were not concerned about the violence.<ref name=\\\"Dragon192\\\"/> [[Sandy Petersen]], in the first \\\"Eye of the Monitor\\\" column, claimed that \\\"there is nothing else quite like ''Wolfenstein''\\\" and that it had \\\"evolved almost beyond recognition\\\" from the original 1981 game. He enthusiastically praised the speed and gameplay, calling it \\\"a fun game with lots of action\\\" and \\\"a fun, fairly mindless romp\\\", though he did note that at higher difficulty settings or later levels it became extremely hard.<ref name=\\\"Dragon197\\\"/> The ''Spear of Destiny'' retail episode was also rated highly by ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s Bryan A. Walker, who praised the added enemy types, though he noted that it was essentially the same game as the shareware episodes.<ref name=\\\"CGW102\\\"/> Formgen's ''Spear of Destiny'' mission packs \\\"Return to Danger\\\" and \\\"Ultimate Challenge\\\" were reviewed by Paul Hyman of ''Computer Gaming World'', who praised the updated graphical details and sound, as well as the smooth gameplay, but noted its overall dated graphics and lack of gameplay changes from the original game.<ref name=\\\"SODPack-CGWreview\\\"/>\\n\\nThe early ports of the game also received high reviews, though their sales have been described as \\\"dismal\\\".<ref name=\\\"NGen11\\\"/> The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential.<ref name=\\\"EGMSNESreview\\\"/> In 1995, ''[[Total!]]'' ranked the game 84th on their \\\"Top 100 SNES Games\\\" list.<ref name=\\\"Total\\\"/> ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' rated the Jaguar version similarly to the Super NES version, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions of the game, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play.<ref name=\\\"EGMJAGreview\\\"/> A ''[[GamePro]]'' review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying ''Wolfenstein 3D'' \\\"set a new standard for PC gaming\\\" and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities.<ref name=\\\"GPJAGreview\\\"/> A ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' review of the Jaguar version was less enthusiastic, terming it good but not up to the standards of newer games.<ref name=\\\"NGjag\\\"/> Its review of the Macintosh version of the game was also mild, stating that \\\"there isn't a staggering amount of freshness here, but the action is fast, deadly, and (surprise) addictive\\\".<ref name=\\\"NGmac\\\"/>\\n\\nMajor Mike of ''GamePro'' commended the 3DO version's complete absence of [[pixelation]], fast scaling, \\\"rousing\\\" music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, \\\"still packs a punch as a first-person shooter\\\".<ref name=\\\"GP3DOreview\\\"/> ''Wolfenstein 3D'' won ''GamePro''{{'}}s Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed ''[[The Need for Speed]]'' and ''[[D (video game)|D]]''.<ref name=\\\"3DOaward\\\"/> ''Maximum'', on the other hand, while stating that the 3DO port was better than the original and as good as the Jaguar version, felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' and the PlayStation version of ''Doom'' that a new port was pointless, with the game now \\\"somewhat tiresome and very, very repetitive\\\".<ref name=\\\"MAX3DOreview\\\"/> A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' asserted that ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was \\\"still as [[video game addiction|addictive]] as it ever was\\\" but essentially agreed with ''Maximum'', contending that anyone interested in first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or \\\"moved on\\\" to more advanced games in the genre.<ref name=\\\"NGen12\\\"/> More modern reviews include one for the [[Xbox 360]] port in 2009 by Ryan McCaffrey of ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'', who heavily criticized it for non-existent enemy AI and bad level design and found it notably inferior to ''Doom'', and one that same year by Daemon Hatfield of [[IGN]], who gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was \\\"dated and flawed\\\", it was \\\"required playing for any first-person shooter

|access-date=August 3, 2023}}</ref>\\n}}\\n\\n''Wolfenstein 3D'' has been called the \\\"grandfather of 3D shooters\\\",<ref name=\\\"CGWHallofFame\\\"/> specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity.<ref name=\\\"CGWHallofFame\\\"/><ref name=\\\"AGGreview\\\"/><ref name=\\\"IGN100\\\"/><ref name=\\\"WIREDretro\\\"/> It has also been called \\\"the ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' of shooters\\\".<ref name=\\\"AGreview\\\"/> Although some prior computer shooting-based games existed, they were generally [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|scrolling shooters]], while ''Wolfenstein 3D'' helped move the market towards first-person shooters. It has also been credited with confirming shareware distribution as a serious and profitable business strategy at the time;<ref name=\\\"GamasutraDoom\\\"/><ref name=\\\"CGWHallofFame\\\"/> ''VideoGames & Computer Entertainment'' claimed in September 1992 that the game \\\"justified the existence of shareware\\\", and in July 1993 ''Computer Gaming World'' claimed that it \\\"almost single-handedly\\\" demonstrated the viability of shareware as a method of publishing, leading to a wave of other shareware first-person shooters.<ref name=\\\"CGW108\\\"/><ref name=\\\"VGCE\\\"/><ref name=\\\"DSretro\\\"/> The game's high revenue compared to prior, smaller 2D titles led Apogee as well as others in the shareware games industry to move towards larger, 3D titles built by larger development teams.<ref name=\\\"20YearsGameUltra\\\"/>\\n\\nDuring development, id approached [[Sierra Entertainment]], then one of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing ''Commander Keen'' and an early version of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', CEO [[Ken Williams (game developer)|Ken Williams]] offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was excited by the deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front as part of the deal rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\\\"MOD94104\\\"/> By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, ''Doom'', the success of ''Wolfenstein 3D'' led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.<ref name=\\\"GamasutraDoom\\\"/> In 1996, ''Computer Gaming World'' declared ''Wolfenstein 3D'' the 97th-best computer game ever released.<ref name=\\\"cgw150\\\"/> \\n\\nThe game is also recognized as the principal cause for Germany banning video games that contain certain types of symbols and imagery from extremist groups like Nazis under its [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' section 86a]] up through 2018. Section 86a had \\\"social adequacy\\\" allowances for works of art, but in 1998, a High District Frankfurt Court case evaluating the Nazi imagery within ''Wolfenstein 3D'' determined that video games did not fall under this allowance. The court ruled that because video games drew younger audiences, \\\"this could lead to them growing up with these symbols and insignias and thereby becoming used to them, which again could make them more vulnerable for ideological manipulation by national socialist ideas\\\".<ref name=\\\"ars tech ban\\\"/> Up through 2018, the Germany software ratings board, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) refused to rate any game that included inappropriate symbols and imagery, effectively banning the game for sale within the country. By May 2018, a new court ruling was made in response to a parody web browser game, in which the [[Public prosecutor's office (Germany)|Public Prosecutor's Office]] confirmed there were no breaches of the law in the game's content.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3DNoBan\\\"/><ref name=\\\"CivicEnlighten\\\"/> Following this, the ban was reversed by the German government in August, having determined that the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' decision was outdated since the USK now included age ratings alongside other content warnings, and that video games should be considered as art under the social adequacy allowance.<ref name=\\\"ars tech ban\\\"/><ref name=\\\"GermanBanReversed\\\"/> In November 2019, ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was formally struck from the \\\"Index\\\", the list of games banned from sale in Germany.<ref name=\\\"Wolf3dGermanyok\\\"/>\\n\\nAfter the game's release, id Software licensed the engine to other developers, like the ''Commander Keen'' engine before it, as part of a series of engine licensing deals that id has made throughout its history; games using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine or derivatives of it include ''[[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold|Blake Stone]]'', the [[Capstone Software]] games ''[[Corridor 7: Alien Invasion|Corridor 7]]'' and ''[[Operation Body Count]]'', as well as ''[[Super 3D Noah's Ark]]''.<ref name=\\\"ENGINEbs\\\"/><ref name=\\\"ENGINEna\\\"/> Apogee intended to produce an expansion pack in 1993 titled ''Rise of the Triad: Wolfenstein 3D Part II'', designed by Tom Hall using the ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine, but during development the game was changed into a stand-alone title with an enhanced engine, ''[[Rise of the Triad]]''.<ref name=\\\"ENGINErott\\\"/> Additionally, Softdisk produced ''[[Catacomb Abyss]]'' using the prototype ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine from ''Catacomb 3-D'' as part of the ''Catacomb Adventure Series'' trilogy of sequels.<ref name=\\\"Apogee FAQ Softdisk\\\"/> Although ''Wolfenstein 3D'' was not designed to be editable or modified, players developed character and level editors to create original alterations to the game's content.<ref name=\\\"CarmackComm\\\"/><ref name=\\\"MOD113117\\\"/> John Carmack and Romero, who had played numerous mods of other games, were delighted, and overrode any concerns about copyright issues by the others.<ref name=\\\"MOD113117\\\"/> The modding efforts of ''Wolfenstein'' players led id Software to explicitly design later titles like ''Doom'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' to be easily modifiable by players, even including the map editing tools id Software used with the games.<ref name=\\\"CarmackComm\\\"/><ref name=\\\"MOD166\\\"/><ref name=\\\"OW\\\"/> The source code for the original ''Wolfenstein 3D'' engine was released by id in 1995; when making the 2009 iOS port, Carmack used some of the enhancements to the engine made by fans after its release.<ref name=\\\"CarmackComm\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Apogee FAQ\\\"/> The game's technical achievements also led to numerous imitators such as ''[[Ken's Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Nitemare 3D]]'', ''[[The Terminator: Rampage]]'', ''[[Pie in the Sky (game engine)#Terminal Terror|Terminal Terror]]'' and ''[[The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki]]'', among others.<ref name=\\\"ROTThistory\\\"/>\\n\\nAlthough id Software did not develop another ''[[Wolfenstein]]'' game, as their development focus shifted to ''Doom'' shortly after release,<ref name=\\\"MOD113117\\\"/> and has never returned to the series, multiple ''Wolfenstein'' titles have been produced by other companies, sometimes using game engines developed by id. The first of these newer ''Wolfenstein'' games was ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' in 2001, a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, and the most recent titles are the 2019 games ''[[Wolfenstein: Youngblood]]'' and ''[[Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot]]''.<ref name=\\\"RTCW\\\"/><ref name=\\\"WTNC\\\"/>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|refs=\\n\\n<!-- GAMEPLAY -->\\n\\n<ref

It is the ninth game in the main ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. The plot focuses on a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow a thief named [[Zidane Tribal]] who kidnaps princess [[Garnet Til Alexandros XVII]] as part of a ploy by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, [[Queen Brahne]] of Alexandria, who started the war.\\n\\nGame development occurred in parallel with ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''. Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy VII|VII]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII|VIII]]'' by returning to the medieval style of the earlier games. Consequently, it draws heavy influence from the original ''[[Final Fantasy (game)|Final Fantasy]]'' and features allusions to the rest of the series. The game introduced new features to the series despite this approach, such as \\\"Active Time Event\\\" cutscenes, \\\"Mognet\\\", and skill systems. ''Final Fantasy IX'' was the last game in the main series whose [[Music of Final Fantasy IX|music]] was composed solely by [[Nobuo Uematsu]].\\n\\n''Final Fantasy IX'' was released to critical acclaim and commercial success, selling more than 5.5 million copies on PlayStation by March 2016. It was re-released in 2010 as a PS1 Classic on the [[PlayStation Store]]\\u2014this version was compatible with [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]; [[PlayStation Vita]] support arrived in 2012. In 2016 Square Enix released an enhanced port featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements, which would be released on several platforms. An animated series adaptation by Square Enix and [[Cyber Group Studios]] was announced in 2021.\\n\\n==Gameplay==\\n{{See also|Gameplay of Final Fantasy}}\\n[[File:Ff9 screenshot fieldicon1.png|thumb|left|The field icon indicates an object is inspectable, such as this ticket booth.]]\\n\\nIn ''Final Fantasy IX'', the player navigates a character through the game world, exploring areas and interacting with [[non-player character]]s.

To traverse these impediments, players can ride [[chocobo]]s, sail on a boat, or pilot [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Airships and transport|airships]]. Like previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, players enter battles caused by [[random encounter]]s with enemies while traveling across the world map or hostile field screens.<ref name=\\\"gameguide\\\" /><ref name=\\\"RevIGN\\\" /> ''Final Fantasy IX'' offers a new approach to town exploration with Active Time Events (ATE). These allow the player to view events unfolding at different locations, providing character development, unique items, and prompts for story-altering decisions. ATEs are occasionally used to simultaneously control two teams when the party divides to solve puzzles and navigate mazes.<ref name=\\\"gameguide\\\" />\\n\\n===Combat and character progression===\\n[[File:Ff9 screenshot bossbattle.png|thumb|right|In this early [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle, Steiner attacks the enemy while Zidane awaits the player's menu input.]]\\n\\nWhen the player encounters an enemy, the map changes to a battle screen.

Trance mode amplifies the character's strength and allows the player to select more powerful attack commands.<ref name=\\\"RevGS\\\" /> For example, Vivi's \\\"Black Magic\\\" command changes into \\\"Double Black\\\", allowing him to cast two magic spells at once.<ref name=\\\"gameguide\\\" /> Winning battles awards money, items, \\\"[[experience point]]s\\\", and \\\"ability points\\\".<ref name=\\\"gameguide\\\" />\\n\\nExperience points determine a character's combat attributes like agility, strength, and magical power. Accumulating sufficient experience points results in a \\\"level up\\\", which permanently increases combat attributes. Equipment worn by a character may also amplify their attributes. Certain weapons and armor also bestow special abilities, which the character may use when equipped. When the character earns enough ability points, it becomes usable without the item equipped.<ref name=\\\"gameguide\\\" /> There are two types of abilities: action and support. Action abilities require [[magic point]]s to use and include magical spells and special moves used in battle. Support abilities provide functions that remain in effect passively, such as increasing power against certain types of enemies. The maximum number of effects characters can equip at once is determined by level.<ref name=\\\"gameguide\\\" /><ref name=\\\"RevGS\\\" />\\n\\n==Plot==\\n<!-- This section has been edited to comply with the featured article criteria.

Most of Gaia's population lives on the Mist Continent, named after the thick Mist that blankets the lowlands. Large mountain ranges act as natural borders that separate its four nations: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra. Alexandria is a warmongering monarchy that controls the eastern half of the continent. One of its cities is Treno, a cultural nexus under perpetual starlight that is home to many aristocrats and paupers alike. The technologically advanced Lindblum, a hub of airship travel, is nestled on a plateau to the southwest. Both countries feature a mix of humans, humanoids, and [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals. Burmecia, a kingdom showered by endless rain, is in the northwest. Cleyra, a neighboring settlement that seceded from Burmecia due to its appreciation for war, is situated in a giant tree in the desert, protected by a sandstorm. Both are inhabited by anthropomorphic rats with a fondness for dance and spear fighting.\\n\\nPlayers eventually explore the Outer, Lost, and Forgotten Continents as well. Civilizations on the Outer Continent include Conde Petie, home of the dwarves; Black Mage Village, a secret settlement of sentient magician drones; and Madain Sari, once home to a near-extinct race of horned humanoid [[Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Summoning|summoners]] who conjure powerful magical beings called eidolons. Also on the Outer Continent is the Iifa Tree, which disperses the Mist to other continents through its roots.

En route to Lindblum, the group discovers that Brahne is manufacturing soulless black mage soldiers that look similar to Vivi. In Lindblum, Cid confirms that he hired the group to protect Garnet from Brahne's newfound aggression. After learning that Alexandria has invaded Burmecia with the black mages, Zidane and Vivi join Freya to investigate. Garnet and Steiner secretly return to Alexandria to reason with Brahne.<ref group=\\\"q\\\">'''Dagger''': I have to help Mother&nbsp;...

Brahne imprisons Garnet, extracts her eidolons,<ref group=\\\"q\\\">'''Queen Brahne''': Zorn, Thorn! Prepare to extract the eidolons from Garnet.</ref> and uses the eidolon, Odin to destroy Cleyra while Zidane's group defends the city. The party escapes on Brahne's airship, rendezvous with Steiner, and rescues Garnet. Meanwhile, Brahne cripples Lindblum with another eidolon, Atomos.<ref group=\\\"q\\\">'''Minister Artania''': Yes, Princess. The castle was spared. Regent Cid is alive.</ref> Cid explains that Kuja supplies Brahne with black mages and the knowledge to use eidolons.

On the Outer Continent, the party defeats Lani and meets Eiko, a summoner who lives with a group of moogles in the village of Madain Sari. Eiko leads Zidane and the others to the Iifa Tree. Inside, they learn that Kuja uses Mist to create the black mages and that Vivi was a prototype.<ref group=\\\"q\\\">'''Zidane''': What kind of weapons did Kuja make? / '''Soulcage''': Kuja called them black mages, dark spawn of the Mist.</ref> The party defeats the monster that generates the Mist within the Tree, which clears it from the Mist Continent. While waiting for Kuja's reprisal at Madain Sari, Lani and Amarant attempt to kidnap Eiko but Zidane and the moogles foil them. Amarant then challenges Zidane to a duel and loses. He joins the party and Garnet learns of her heritage as a summoner who was adopted by Brahne as a child. At the Tree, Brahne attempts to kill Kuja with an eidolon so she can rule unopposed, but he takes control of it and destroys her and her army.<ref group=\\\"q\\\">'''Queen Brahne''': Kuja!

I granted you the freedom to do as you wish in Gaia for one purpose alone.

An eidolon with the power to bury Garland! His powers are so incredible; I cannot even come close. I must destroy him before Terra's plan is activated, or my soul will no longer be my own!</ref> The party chases Kuja through a portal to Terra, where the antagonists' goals become clear. The Terrans created Garland to merge their dying world with Gaia; Garland, in turn, created self-aware, soulless vessels called Genomes.<ref group=\\\"q\\\">'''Garland''': I constructed the Genomes to be vessels for the souls of the people of Terra when they awaken.</ref> For millennia, Garland has been using the Iifa Tree to replace deceased Gaian souls with the hibernating Terran souls, turning the former into Mist in the process; this will allow the Terrans to be reborn into the Genomes after the planetary merge.<ref group=\\\"q\\\">'''Garland''': the Iifa Tree blocks the flow of Gaia's souls, while it lets those of Terra flow freely.</ref><ref group=\\\"q\\\">'''Garland''': The role of the Iifa Tree is that of Soul Divider.

Kuja is just an angel of death who sends souls to the Tree of Iifa. / '''Garland''': Yes, my angel of death.

Kuja defeats Garland, who reveals before dying that the former has a limited lifespan anyhow: Garland designed Zidane to be his replacement.<ref group=\\\"q\\\">'''Garland''': There's a limit to your life&nbsp;...

Kuja's still alive.

However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search. There are specialized [[data structures]] designed for fast searching, such as [[hash tables]], that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.\\n\\nThere are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, [[fractional cascading]] speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in [[computational geometry]] and in numerous other fields. [[Exponential search]] extends binary search to unbounded lists. The [[binary search tree]] and [[B-tree]] data structures are based on binary search.\\n\\n== Algorithm ==\\nBinary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array.

However, it is sometimes necessary to find the leftmost element or the rightmost element for a target value that is duplicated in the array. In the above example, the 4th element is the leftmost element of the value 4, while the 5th element is the rightmost element of the value 4.

The comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as every level above the lowest level of the tree is filled completely.{{Efn|Any search algorithm based solely on comparisons can be represented using a binary comparison tree. An ''internal path'' is any path from the root to an existing node. Let <math>I</math> be the ''internal path length'', the sum of the lengths of all internal paths. If each element is equally likely to be searched, the average case is <math>1 + \\\\frac{I}{n}</math> or simply one plus the average of all the internal path lengths of the tree. This is because internal paths represent the elements that the search algorithm compares to the target. The lengths of these internal paths represent the number of iterations ''after'' the root node. Adding the average of these lengths to the one iteration at the root yields the average case. Therefore, to minimize the average number of comparisons, the internal path length <math>I</math> must be minimized. It turns out that the tree for binary search minimizes the internal path length. {{Harvnb|Knuth|1998}} proved that the ''external path'' length (the path length over all nodes where both children are present for each already-existing node) is minimized when the external nodes (the nodes with no children) lie within two consecutive levels of the tree. This also applies to internal paths as internal path length <math>I</math> is linearly related to external path length <math>E</math>. For any tree of <math>n</math> nodes, <math>I = E - 2n</math>. When each subtree has a similar number of nodes, or equivalently the array is divided into halves in each iteration, the external nodes as well as their interior parent nodes lie within two levels. It follows that binary search minimizes the number of average comparisons as its comparison tree has the lowest possible internal path length.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Further analysis of binary search\\\"}}}} Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, increasing the number of iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over ''all'' elements is worse than binary search. By dividing the array in half, binary search ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Further analysis of binary search\\\"}}\\n\\n=== Space complexity ===\\nBinary search requires three pointers to elements, which may be array indices or pointers to memory locations, regardless of the size of the array.

The average case is different for successful searches and unsuccessful searches. It will be assumed that each element is equally likely to be searched for successful searches. For unsuccessful searches, it will be assumed that the [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]] between and outside elements are equally likely to be searched. The average case for successful searches is the number of iterations required to search every element exactly once, divided by <math>n</math>, the number of elements. The average case for unsuccessful searches is the number of iterations required to search an element within every interval exactly once, divided by the <math>n + 1</math> intervals.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Further analysis of binary search\\\"}}\\n\\n==== Successful searches ====\\n<!-- E stands for \\\"expected\\\" -->\\nIn the binary tree representation, a successful search can be represented by a path from the root to the target node, called an ''internal path''. The length of a path is the number of edges (connections between nodes) that the path passes through. The number of iterations performed by a search, given that the corresponding path has length <math>l</math>, is <math>l + 1</math> counting the initial iteration. The ''internal path length'' is the sum of the lengths of all unique internal paths. Since there is only one path from the root to any single node, each internal path represents a search for a specific element. If there are <math>n</math> elements, which is a positive integer, and the internal path length is <math>I(n)</math>, then the average number of iterations for a successful search <math>T(n) = 1 + \\\\frac{I(n)}{n}</math>, with the one iteration added to count the initial iteration.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Further analysis of binary search\\\"}}\\n\\nSince binary search is the optimal algorithm for searching with comparisons, this problem is reduced to calculating the minimum internal path length of all binary trees with <math>n</math> nodes, which is equal to:{{Sfn|Knuth|1997|loc=\\u00a72.3.4.5 (\\\"Path length\\\")}}\\n\\n<math>\\nI(n) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\log_2(k) \\\\right \\\\rfloor\\n</math>\\n\\nFor example, in a 7-element array, the root requires one iteration, the two elements below the root require two iterations, and the four elements below require three iterations.

If an internal node, or a node present in the tree, has fewer than two child nodes, then additional child nodes, called external nodes, are added so that each internal node has two children. By doing so, an unsuccessful search can be represented as a path to an external node, whose parent is the single element that remains during the last iteration. An ''external path'' is a path from the root to an external node. The ''external path length'' is the sum of the lengths of all unique external paths.

Assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, each iteration makes 1.5 comparisons on average. A variation of the algorithm checks whether the middle element is equal to the target at the end of the search. On average, this eliminates half a comparison from each iteration. This slightly cuts the time taken per iteration on most computers. However, it guarantees that the search takes the maximum number of iterations, on average adding one iteration to the search. Because the comparison loop is performed only <math display=\\\"inline\\\">\\\\lfloor \\\\log_2 (n) + 1 \\\\rfloor</math> times in the worst case, the slight increase in efficiency per iteration does not compensate for the extra iteration for all but very large <math display=\\\"inline\\\">n</math>.{{Efn|{{Harvnb|Knuth|1998}} showed on his [[MIX (abstract machine)|MIX]] computer model, which Knuth designed as a representation of an ordinary computer, that the average running time of this variation for a successful search is <math display=\\\"inline\\\">17.5 \\\\log_2 n + 17</math> units of time compared to <math display=\\\"inline\\\">18 \\\\log_2 n - 16</math> units for regular binary search.

For example, comparing a pair of 64-bit unsigned integers would require comparing up to double the bits as comparing a pair of 32-bit unsigned integers. The worst case is achieved when the integers are equal. This can be significant when the encoding lengths of the elements are large, such as with large integer types or long strings, which makes comparing elements expensive. Furthermore, comparing [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] values (the most common digital representation of [[real number]]s) is often more expensive than comparing integers or short strings.\\n\\nOn most computer architectures, the [[Central processing unit|processor]] has a hardware [[Cache (computing)|cache]] separate from [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. Since they are located within the processor itself, caches are much faster to access but usually store much less data than RAM. Therefore, most processors store memory locations that have been accessed recently, along with memory locations close to it. For example, when an array element is accessed, the element itself may be stored along with the elements that are stored close to it in RAM, making it faster to sequentially access array elements that are close in index to each other ([[locality of reference]]). On a sorted array, binary search can jump to distant memory locations if the array is large, unlike algorithms (such as [[linear search]] and [[linear probing]] in [[hash tables]]) which access elements in sequence. This adds slightly to the running time of binary search for large arrays on most systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khuong|first1=Paul-Virak|last2=Morin|first2=Pat|s2cid=23752485|author2-link= Pat Morin |title=Array Layouts for Comparison-Based Searching|journal=Journal of Experimental Algorithmics|year=2017|volume=22|at=Article 1.3|doi=10.1145/3053370|arxiv=1509.05053}}</ref>\\n\\n== Binary search versus other schemes ==\\nSorted arrays with binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval, taking <math display=\\\"inline\\\">O(n)</math> time for each such operation.

The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary search trees.

For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as [[van Emde Boas tree]]s, [[fusion tree]]s, [[trie]]s, and [[bit array]]s. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute.<ref name=\\\"pred\\\" /> As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.<ref name=\\\"judyarray\\\" />\\n\\n== Variations ==\\n\\n=== Uniform binary search ===\\n{{Main|Uniform binary search}}\\n[[File:Uniform binary search.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[Uniform binary search]] stores the difference between the current and the two next possible middle elements instead of specific bounds.]]\\nUniform binary search stores, instead of the lower and upper bounds, the difference in the index of the middle element from the current iteration to the next iteration. A [[lookup table]] containing the differences is computed beforehand. For example, if the array to be searched is {{math|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]}}, the middle element (<math>m</math>) would be {{math|6}}. In this case, the middle element of the left subarray ({{math|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}}) is {{math|3}} and the middle element of the right subarray ({{math|[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]}}) is {{math|9}}. Uniform binary search would store the value of {{math|3}} as both indices differ from {{math|6}} by this same amount.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"An important variation\\\"}} To reduce the search space, the algorithm either adds or subtracts this change from the index of the middle element.

A search takes <math display=\\\"inline\\\">\\\\lfloor \\\\log_2 x + 1\\\\rfloor</math> iterations before binary search is started and at most <math display=\\\"inline\\\">\\\\lfloor \\\\log_2 x \\\\rfloor</math> iterations of the binary search, where <math display=\\\"inline\\\">x</math> is the position of the target value.

It works on the basis that the midpoint is not the best guess in many cases. For example, if the target value is close to the highest element in the array, it is likely to be located near the end of the array.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Interpolation search\\\"}}\\n\\nA common interpolation function is [[linear interpolation]].

Binary search trees are one such generalization&mdash;when a vertex (node) in the tree is queried, the algorithm either learns that the vertex is the target, or otherwise which subtree the target would be located in. However, this can be further generalized as follows: given an undirected, positively weighted graph and a target vertex, the algorithm learns upon querying a vertex that it is equal to the target, or it is given an incident edge that is on the shortest path from the queried vertex to the target. The standard binary search algorithm is simply the case where the graph is a path. Similarly, binary search trees are the case where the edges to the left or right subtrees are given when the queried vertex is unequal to the target.

The earliest known example was the Inakibit-Anu tablet from Babylon dating back to {{circa|200 BCE}}. The tablet contained about 500 [[sexagesimal]] numbers and their [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] sorted in [[lexicographical order]], which made searching for a specific entry easier. In addition, several lists of names that were sorted by their first letter were discovered on the [[Aegean Islands]]. ''[[Catholicon (1286)|Catholicon]]'', a Latin dictionary finished in 1286 CE, was the first work to describe rules for sorting words into alphabetical order, as opposed to just the first few letters.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"History and bibliography\\\"}}\\n\\nIn 1946, [[John Mauchly]] made the first mention of binary search as part of the [[Moore School Lectures]], a seminal and foundational college course in computing.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"History and bibliography\\\"}} In 1957, [[W.

In a letter to the East India Company, Cocks wrote:\\n\\n{{Blockquote|I find the man tractable and willing to do your worships the best service he may... I am persuaded I could live with him seven years before any extraordinary speeches should happen between us.<ref name=\\\"CocksDiary\\\" />}}\\n\\nInstead of returning to England, Adams accepted employment with the newly founded Hirado trading factory, signing a contract on 24{{nbsp}}November 1613, with the East India Company for the yearly salary of 100 [[Pound sterling#1601 to 1816|English Pounds]]. This was more than double the regular salary of 40 pounds earned by the other factors at Hirado. Adams had a lead role, under [[Richard Cocks]] and together with six other compatriots (Tempest Peacock, Richard Wickham, William Eaton, Walter Carwarden, Edmund Sayers and William Nealson), in organising this new English settlement. Adams had advised the Company against the choice of Hirado, which was small and far away from the major markets in Osaka and Edo; he had recommended selection of [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] near Edo for a post. However, Saris wanted to keep an eye on the Dutch activities, and also distrusted Adams.<ref>Rogers, p. 217.</ref>\\n\\n===Expeditions to Asia===\\nDuring the ten-year operations of the East India Company (1613 to 1623), only three English ships after the ''Clove'' brought cargoes directly from London to Japan. They were invariably described as having poor value on the Japanese market. The only trade which helped support the factory was that organised between Japan and South-East Asia; this was chiefly Adams selling Chinese goods for Japanese silver:\\n<blockquote>Were it not for hope of trade into China, or procuring some benefit from Siam, Pattania and Cochin China, it were no staying in Japon, yet it is certen here is silver enough & may be carried out at pleasure, but then we must bring them commodities to their liking.<ref name=\\\"CocksDiary\\\">Richard Cocks' diary, 1617</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=April 2024}}</blockquote>\\n\\n[[File:Japanese Red Seal Ship Shuinsen 1634.png|thumb|A Japanese [[red seal ship]] used for Asian trade \\u2013 1634, unknown artist]]\\n\\nAdams tried to organise an expedition to the legendary [[Northwest Passage]] from Asia, which would have greatly reduced the sailing distance between Japan and Europe. Ieyasu asked him if \\\"our countrimen could not find the northwest passage\\\" and Adams contacted the [[East India Company]] to organise manpower and supplies. The expedition never got underway. In his later years, Adams made a number of trading voyages to [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siam]] and [[Cochinchina]], sometimes for the company, sometimes for his own account. He is recorded in Japanese records as the owner of a red seal ship of 500 tons. Given the few ships that the company sent from England and the poor trading value of their cargoes (broadcloth, knives, looking glasses, Indian cotton, etc.), Adams was influential in gaining trading certificates from the shogun to allow the company to participate in the red seal system. It made a total of seven junk voyages to Southeast Asia with mixed profit results. Four were led by William Adams as captain. Adams renamed a ship he acquired in 1617 as ''Gift of God;'' he sailed it on his expedition that year to Cochinchina. The expeditions he led are described more fully below.\\n\\nIn 1614, Adams wanted to organise a trade expedition to Siam to bolster the company factory's activities and cash situation. He bought and upgraded a 200-ton Japanese junk for the company, renaming her ''Sea Adventure'', and hired about 120 Japanese sailors and merchants, as well as several Chinese traders, an Italian and a Castilian (Spanish) trader. The heavily laden ship left Hirado in November 1614. The merchants Richard Wickham and Edmund Sayers of the English factory's staff also joined the voyage. The expedition was to purchase raw silk, Chinese goods, [[Biancaea sappan|sappan wood]], deer skins and ray skins (the latter used for the hilts of Japanese swords). The ship carried \\u00a31,250 in silver and \\u00a3175 of merchandise (Indian cottons, Japanese weapons and lacquerware). The party encountered a typhoon near the [[Ryukyu Islands]] (modern [[Okinawa]]) and had to stop at [[Naha]] on 27 January 1615. King [[Sh\\u014d Nei]] refused to assist with repairs, the crew went on strike, and the ship was ordered to surrender its anchorage in February.<ref>Rogers, p. 221-222.</ref> It returned to Hirado in June 1615 with a cargo of produce from the Ryukyus, including Japan's first [[sweet potato]]es, which were initially cultivated by the Company in Hirado and later grown in [[Satsuma province]].<ref>Rogers, p. 223.</ref>\\n\\nAfter a trip to Edo to meet with the ambassador from [[New Spain]] on Shogun Ieyasu's orders, Adams left Hirado on 7 December 1615 for Ayutthaya in Siam on the refitted ''Sea Adventure,'' intent on obtaining sappan wood for resale in Japan.<ref>Rogers, pp. 223-224.</ref> His cargo was chiefly silver (\\u00a3600) and the Japanese and Indian goods unsold from the previous voyage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} In Bangkok, Adams met with the King of Siam and obtained a trading license for the English, and then sailed the ''Sea Adventure'' to Japan with 143 tonnes of sappan wood and 3,700 deer skins, returning to Hirado in 47 days. (The return trip took from 5 June to 22 July 1616).<ref>Rogers, p. 224.</ref>\\n\\nLess than a week before Adams's return, Ieyasu died, giving his son Shogun [[Hidetada]] practical control over the country. Hidetada was less interested in foreign affairs than Ieyasu, and excluded Adams from his next audience with the Company, in part due to distrust stemming from Adams's wife's conversion to Christianity.<ref>Rogers, p. 229.</ref> However, three weeks later, Hidetada met with Adams, and in September he agreed to maintain the English trading privileges and also issued a new red seal permit (''shuinj\\u014d'') to Adams, which allowed Adams to continue trade activities overseas under the shogun's protection. While Hidetada confined English trading activities to Hirado and Nagasaki, and barred Japanese merchants from purchasing goods from foreigners in Osaka and Kyoto, Adams retained his ''hatamoto'' status and was exempt from these restrictions.<ref>Rogers, p. 230-231.</ref>\\n\\nAdams declined to join an English expedition from Hirado in December 1616; there is evidence that he was suffering from a mental breakdown around this time due to the death of Ieyasu and political aftershocks, as well as physical injuries Adams sustained on the way back from Edo after meeting Hidetada.<ref>Rogers, p. 232.</ref>\\n\\nIn March 1617, Adams set sail for Cochinchina, having purchased the junk Sayers had brought from Siam and renamed it the ''Gift of God''. He intended to find two English factors, Tempest Peacock and Walter Carwarden, who had departed from Hirado two years before to explore commercial opportunities on the first voyage to Southeast Asia by the English factory in Hirado. Adams learned in Cochinchina that Peacock had been plied with drink, and killed for his silver. Carwarden, who was waiting in a boat downstream, realised that Peacock had been killed and hastily tried to reach his ship. His boat overturned and he drowned. Adams sold a small cargo of broadcloth, Indian piece goods and ivory in Cochinchina for the modest amount of \\u00a3351.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\\n\\nAdams then sailed ''Gift of God'' to Osaka, met with Hidetada at [[Fushimi Castle]] in September 1617, and obtained new red seal licenses. He agreed to sell both the ship and the licenses to the English factory in Hirado.<ref>Rogers, p. 242.</ref>\\n\\n===Rifts with English and Dutch===\\nAdams joined a Dutch mission from Hirado to Edo in July 1618. Shortly thereafter, the Dutch brought the captured English ship ''Attendance'' to Hirado, sparking hostilities between the previously friendly English and Dutch merchants there. Adams refused to help the English appeal to the Shogun about the issue, arguing that Hidetada would not be interested.<ref>Rogers, pp. 246-249.</ref> Adams later changed his mind and met with Hidetada in October, but due to Adams's prior sale of his Red Seal license to the English, and disturbances that occurred on the resulting voyage, Hidetada refused to grant further licenses to the factory. Adams returned to Hirado in December after spending months attempting to save the English factory.<ref>Rogers, p. 250.</ref>\\n\\nAdams arranged a final voyage to Cochinchina and Tonkin from March to August 1619, using a personal Red Seal license rather than working for the English. During this voyage, England and the Netherlands went to war in Asia, and Adams contracted a tropical disease which caused his health to deteriorate remarkably. However, after returning to Hirado, Adams managed to rescue three English prisoners who were imprisoned on a Dutch ship.<ref>Rogers, pp. 251-252.</ref> In the final months of his life, Adams assisted the English factory by acting as a broker for trade with the governor of Nagasaki.<ref>Rogers, p. 257.</ref>\\n\\n== Family ==\\nAdams was recorded to have married Mary Hyn in the parish church of [[St Dunstan's, Stepney]]<ref name=\\\"milton\\\" /> on 20 August 1589.

In his will, he left his townhouse in Edo, his fief in Hemi, and 500 English pounds to be divided evenly between his family in England and his family in Japan. The English family's portion of the inheritance did not reach London until 1622, at which point Mary Hyn was already dead.<ref>Rogers, p. 262.</ref>\\n\\nCocks wrote: \\\"I cannot but be sorrowful for the loss of such a man as Capt William Adams, he having been in such favour with two Emperors of Japan as never any Christian in these part of the world.\\\"<ref name=\\\"CocksDiary\\\" />\\n\\nCocks records that Hidetada transferred the lordship from William Adams to his son Joseph Adams with the attendant rights to the estate at Hemi.<ref name=\\\"CocksDiary\\\" /> Cocks continued to remain in contact with Adams's Japanese family, sending gifts. On the Christmas after Adams's death, Cocks gave Joseph his father's sword and dagger. In March 1622, he offered silks to Joseph and Susanna. Cocks also administered Adams's trading rights (the ''shuinj\\u014d'') for the benefit of Adams's children, Joseph and Susanna. He carried this out conscientiously.\\n\\nIn 1623, the unprofitable English trading factory in Hirado was dissolved by the East India Company and Cocks departed for England, the Dutch traded on Adams' children's behalf via the red seal ships.

The Meiji period had seen the slow introduction of kimono types that mediated between the informal and the most formal, a trend that continued throughout the Taish\\u014d period, as social occasions and opportunities for leisure increased under the abolition of class distinctions. As Western clothing increased in popularity for men as everyday clothing, the kimono industry further established its own traditions of formal and informal dress for women; this saw the invention of the {{transliteration|ja|h\\u014dmongi}}, divisions of {{transliteration|ja|tomesode}} (short-sleeved) kimono for women, and {{transliteration|ja|montsuki hakama}}.{{r|Valk|p=133-134|q=Noriko Harada notes that women in the early 20th century began to attend public events and formal, ritual events more, and as a result, they needed a new kind of formal wear. A particularly savvy invention on the part of the industry was the h\\u014dmongi in the Taisho era (1912\\u20131926), which is now women's formal wear par excellence (Harada in Koizumi 2006: 39). Toby Slade writes that by the Taisho period, department stores, many of which started out as kimono shops, were involved in marketing trends in kimono style (Slade 2009: 132; see also Milhaupt 2014: 104-5). In this way, the industry was instrumental in establishing not just trends but the modern rules of the 'kimono canon' itself. Many of these rules had not existed before the 20th century. Many of these rules, such as the montsuki hakama for men, and the h\\u014dmongi and tomesode kimono for women, invented in the early 20th century, remain entrenched today. This is the reason why there is a proliferation of types of kimono for women and very few for men: the industry knew that they could no longer expect men to buy kimono, but there was a lucrative market in selling to women and creating ever-expanding types of kimono that women felt they needed to have in order to be equipped for every possible occasion.}} The bridal kimono [[Hope chest|trousseau]] ({{transliteration|ja|oyomeiri d\\u014dgu}}), an uncommon practice of the upper classes in the Edo period, also became common throughout the middle classes;{{r|Valk|p=67, 76}} traditions of kimono bridalwear for marriage ceremonies were also codified in this time, which resembled the bridalwear of samurai-class women.{{r|Valk|p=82, 93, 146}} Standards of {{transliteration|ja|kitsuke}} at this time began to slowly graduate to a more formalised, neatened appearance, with a flat, uniform {{transliteration|ja|ohashori}} and a smooth, uncreased {{transliteration|ja|obi}}, which also resembled the \\\"proper\\\" {{transliteration|ja|kitsuke}} of upper-class women. However, {{transliteration|ja|kitsuke}} standards were still relatively informal, and would not become formalised until after World War II.\\n\\n====Sh\\u014dwa period (1926\\u20131989)====\\n[[File:Cha-baori (easy haori) 1957.jpg|thumb|A 1957 clothing ad, showing postwar {{transliteration|ja|kitsuke}} standards for women, which promoted a neater, more standardised appearance]]\\nWhile kimono were no longer common wear for men, they remained everyday wear for Japanese women until [[Japan during World War II|World War II]] (1940\\u20131945).{{r|Valk|p=17}} Though the Taish\\u014d period had seen a number of invented traditions, standards of {{transliteration|ja|kitsuke}} (wearing kimono) were still not as formalised in this time, with creases, uneven {{transliteration|ja|ohashori}} and crooked {{transliteration|ja|obi}} still deemed acceptable.{{r|Valk|p=44-45}}\\n\\nDuring the war, kimono factories shut down, and the government encouraged people to wear {{transliteration|ja|[[monpe]]}} (also romanised as {{transliteration|ja|mompe}}) \\u2013 trousers constructed from old kimono \\u2013 instead.{{r|Valk|p=131}} Fibres such as rayon became widespread during WWII, being inexpensive to produce and cheap to buy, and typically featured printed designs.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} Cloth rationing persisted until 1951, so most kimono were made at home from repurposed fabrics.{{r|Valk|p=131}}\\n\\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the Japanese economy boomed,{{r|Valk|p=36}} and silk became cheaper,{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} making it possible for the average family to afford silk kimono.{{r|Valk|p=76}} The kimono retail industry had developed an elaborate codification of rules for kimono-wearing, with types of kimono, levels of formality, and rules on seasonality, which intensified after the war; there had previously been rules about kimono-wearing, but these were not rigidly codified and varied by region and class.{{r|Valk|p=36}} Formalisation sought perfection, with no creases or unevenness in the kimono, and an increasingly tubular figure was promoted as the ideal for women in kimono.{{r|Valk|p=44-45}} The kimono-retail industry also promoted a sharp distinction between Japanese and Western clothes;{{r|Valk|p=54}} for instance, wearing Western shoes with Japanese clothing (while common in the Taish\\u014d period) was codified as improper;{{r|Valk|p=16}} these rules on proper dressing are often described in Japanese using the English phrase \\\"Time, Place, and Occasion\\\" (TPO). As neither Japanese men or women commonly wore kimono, having grown up under wartime auspices, commercial {{transliteration|ja|kitsuke}} schools were set up to teach women how to don kimono.{{r|Valk|p=44}} Men in this period rarely wore kimono, and menswear thus escaped most of the formalisation.{{r|Valk|p=36, 133}}).\\n\\nKimono were promoted as essential for ceremonial occasions;{{r|Valk|p=76, 135}} for instance, the expensive {{transliteration|ja|[[furisode]]}} worn by young women for {{transliteration|ja|[[Seijinshiki]]}} was deemed a necessity.{{r|Valk|p=60}} Bridal trousseaus containing tens of kimono of every possible subtype were also promoted as ''de rigueur'', and parents felt obliged to provide{{r|Valk|p=76}} kimono trousseaus that cost up to 10 million yen (~\\u00a370,000),{{r|Valk|p=262}} which were displayed and inspected publicly as part of the wedding, including being transported in transparent trucks.{{r|Valk|p=81}}\\n\\nBy the 1970s, formal kimono formed the vast majority of kimono sales.{{r|Valk|p=132}} Kimono retailers, due to the pricing structure of brand new kimono, had developed a relative monopoly on not only prices but also a perception of kimono knowledge, allowing them to dictate prices and heavily promote more formal (and expensive) purchases, as selling a single formal kimono could support the seller comfortably for three months. The kimono industry peaked in 1975, with total sales of 2.8 trillion yen (~\\u00a318 billion). The sale of informal brand new kimono was largely neglected.{{r|Valk|p=135, 136}}\\n\\n====Heisei period (1989\\u20132019)====\\nThe economic collapse of the 1990s bankrupted much of the kimono industry{{r|Valk|p=129}} and ended a number of expensive practices.{{r|Valk|p=98}} The rules for how to wear kimono lost their previous hold over the entire industry,{{r|Valk|p=36}} and formerly-expensive traditions such as bridal kimono trousseaus generally disappeared, and when still given, were much less extensive.{{r|Valk|p=98}} It was during this time that it became acceptable and even preferred for women to wear Western dress to ceremonial occasions like weddings and funerals.{{r|Valk|pp=95, 263}} Many women had dozens or even hundreds of kimono, mostly unworn, in their homes; a secondhand kimono, even if unworn, would sell for about 500 yen (less than \\u00a33.50;{{r|Valk|p=98}} about US$5), a few percent of the bought-new price. In the 1990s and early 2000s, many secondhand kimono shops opened as a result of this.{{r|Valk|p=98}}\\n\\nIn the early years of the 21st century, the cheaper and simpler {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} became popular with young people.{{r|Valk|p=37}} Around 2010, men began wearing kimono again in situations other than their own wedding,{{r|Valk|p=36, 159}} and kimono were again promoted and worn as everyday dress by a small minority.{{r|Valk}}\\n\\n====Reiwa period (2019\\u2013present)====\\nToday, the majority of people in Japan wear Western clothing as everyday attire, and are most likely to wear kimono either to formal occasions such as wedding ceremonies and funerals, or to summer events, where the standard kimono is the easy-to-wear, single-layer cotton {{transliteration|ja|yukata}}.\\n\\nIn 2019, the mayor of Kyoto announced that his staff were working to register \\\"Kimono Culture\\\" on [[UNESCO]]'s [[intangible cultural heritage]] list.<ref name=\\\"Guardian2019-07-01\\\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/01/our-traditional-garment-is-not-spandex-kim-kardashian-west-renames-brand-amid-outcry|title=#KimOhNo: Kim Kardashian West renames Kimono brand amid outcry|last=Ho|first=Vivian|date=2019-07-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-07-02|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\\n\\n==Textiles==\\n{{main|Tanmono}}\\n[[File:Komono cropped.png|thumb|left|A child wearing a {{transliteration|ja|furisode}} kimono in full formal dress|165x165px]]\\n\\nBoth kimono and {{transliteration|ja|obi}} are made from a wide variety of fibre types, including hemp, linen, silk, Japanese [[Cr\\u00eape (textile)|cr\\u00eape]] (known as {{transliteration|ja|chirimen}}), and figured [[damask]] weaves ({{transliteration|ja|[[rinzu]]}}).

Motifs are typically worn a few weeks before the official 'start' of any given season, as it is considered fashionable to anticipate the coming season.\\n\\nThough men's kimono historically displayed just as much decoration and variety as women's kimono, in the modern era, the principal distinction of men's kimono in terms of seasonality and occasion is the fabric. The typical men's kimono is a subdued, dark colour; black, dark blues, greens and browns are common. Fabrics are usually matte, in contrast to the occasional satin weaves of some women's kimono. Some men's kimono have a subtle pattern, and textured fabrics are more common in informal men's kimono. Informal men's kimono may also feature slightly brighter colours, such as lighter purples, greens and blues.

As the [[seam allowance]] on nearly every panel features two [[selvedge]]s that will not fray, the woven edges of the fabric bolt are retained when the kimono is sewn, leading to large and often uneven seam allowances; unlike Western clothing, the seam allowances are not trimmed down, allowing for a kimono to be resewn to different measurements without the fabric fraying at the seams.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} This was also used to prolong the life of the garment by reversing the sleeves (hiding the worn cuff hem in the shoulder seam) or the back panels (swapping the high-stress center seam and the low-stress sides),<ref name=mochi_komon/> like the European custom of side-to-middling or end-to-middling bedsheets.\\n\\nHistorically, kimono were taken apart entirely to be washed \\u2013 a process known as {{transliteration|ja|arai-hari}}. Once cleaned, the fabric would be resewn by hand;<ref name=\\\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\\\"/> this process, though necessary in previous centuries, is uncommon in modern-day Japan, as it is relatively expensive.\\n\\nDespite the expense of hand-sewing, however, some modern kimono, including silk kimono and all formal kimono, are still hand-sewn entirely; even machine-sewn kimono require some degree of hand-sewing, particularly in finishing the collar, the hem, and the lining, if present. Hand-sewn kimono are usually sewn with a single running stitch roughly {{convert|3|mm}} to {{convert|4|mm}} long, with stitches growing shorter around the collar area for strength.

The shop will charge a fee separate to the cost of the fabric for it to be sewn to the customer's measurements, and fees for washing the fabric or weatherproofing it may be added as another separate cost.

These varieties are primarily based on formality and gender, with more women's varieties of kimono existing than men's.\\n\\nThe modern kimono canon was roughly formalised after WWII, following fabric shortages, a generation unfamiliar with wearing kimono in everyday life, and the postwar revival of kimono sales by {{transliteration|ja|gofukuya}}, traditional kimono shops. In previous centuries, types of kimono were not as distinct, with factors such as age and social class playing a much larger role in determining kimono types than they do presently. Beginning in the Meiji period, and following the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of class distinctions, kimono varieties began to change as Japanese society did, with new varieties being invented for new social situations.\\n\\n==={{anchor|Formality}}Formality===\\n[[File:MET_2001_428_45_mon_komon.jpg|thumb|right|A {{transliteration|ja|hinata kamon}} dyed onto a kimono]]\\n[[File:Shadow kamon on haori.jpg|thumb|A dyed 'shadow' ({{transliteration|ja|kage}}) {{transliteration|ja|kamon}} on the centre-back seam of a {{transliteration|ja|haori}}]]\\n\\nKimono range in variation from extremely formal to very casual. For women, the formality is determined mostly by pattern placement, decoration style, fabric choice and colour. For men, whose kimono are generally monochromatic, formality is determined typically by fabric choice and colour. For both men and women, the accessories and {{transliteration|ja|obi}} worn with the kimono also determine formality.\\n\\nThe formality levels of different types of kimono are a relatively modern invention, having been developed between late Meiji- to post-war Japan, following the abolition of Edo-period sumptuary clothing laws in 1868.<ref name=\\\"restoration\\\">{{cite journal |last1=Fukatsu-Fukuoka |first1=Yuko |title=The Evolution of ''Yuzen''-dyeing Techniques and Designs after the Meiji Restoration |date=2004 |issue=475 |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1474&context=tsaconf |journal=Textile Society of America Symposium Proceedings |publisher=DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231007161552/https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1474&context=tsaconf |archive-date= Oct 7, 2023 }}</ref> These laws changed constantly, as did the strictness with which they were enforced, and were designed to keep the nouveau riche merchant classes from dressing above their station, and appearing better-dressed than monetarily-poor but status-rich [[samurai]] class.\\n\\n====Colours and patterns====\\nUnder feudal sumptuary laws, colours were restricted by class; for instance, [[indigo]]-dyed clothing was allowed for all classes, and was commonly seen in hand-dyed cotton, linen or hemp {{transliteration|ja|[[kasuri]]}} fabrics, but other dyes, such as reds and purples, were forbidden to those below a certain class. Sometimes, for some classes, designs were restricted to below the belt, to the bottoms of the sleeves (for {{transliteration|ja|furisode}}) or to along the hem ({{transliteration|ja|suso-moyo}}); sometimes they were banned altogether,<ref name=\\\"mochi_furisode\\\"/> and were transferred to the collar of the underkimono,<ref name=\\\"mochi_tomosode\\\"/> or the inside of the hem, where only the faintest glimpse would be intermittently visible. This type of subtle ostentation became an aesthetic known as {{transliteration|ja|[[Iki (aesthetics)|iki]]}}, and outlasted the sumptuary laws.<ref name=\\\"mochi_furisode\\\"/> Modern-day rules of formality, however, still echo clothing distinctions typically employed by the uppermost samurai classes.<ref name=\\\"mochi_furisode\\\"/>\\n\\nAspects of men's kimono still follow this extreme of {{transliteration|ja|iki}}. Bright, elaborate decoration is used on the lining of the {{transliteration|ja|haori}} (jacket), and on men's {{transliteration|ja|juban}} (underkimono), which is not worn as an outer layer outside the home, and so only shows at the neck and inside the sleeves. Women's {{transliteration|ja|juban}} were once bright and boldly-patterned (and were often kimono too damaged to use as an outer layer, repurposed), but are now typically muted pastel shades.<ref name=mochi_juban/><ref name=\\\"mochi_komon\\\"/> The outside of men's garments tended towards subtle patterns and colours even after the sumptuary laws lifted, with blues and blacks predominating, but designers later came to use browns, greens, purples, and other colours in increasingly bold patterns.\\n\\nOlder people generally wear more subtle patterns, and younger people brighter, bolder ones.\\n\\n====Fabric type====\\n[[File:Shinto married couple.jpg|thumb|left|Couple being married in formal traditional dress]]\\n\\nKimono vary widely in fabric type, and are not all made of silk. Certain types of fabric, such as wool, cotton, linen and hemp, are always considered informal, and so are not seen on more formal varieties of kimono.

This applies to all types of kimono, with a few caveats: the very informal {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} is always unlined, and thus only worn in summer; the most formal kimono, in contrast, are unlikely to be worn unlined in summer, as many people simply do not have more than one formal kimono to wear, and do not wear formal kimono often enough to warrant the purchase of a new, unlined kimono, just for summer wear. {{transliteration|ja|Obi}} also change fabric type in the summer months.\\n\\nWithin the two realms of lined and unlined, further distinctions exist for different months. Lined kimono are either made from transparent or gauze fabrics ({{transliteration|ja|usu-mono}}) or opaque fabrics, with kimono transitioning towards gauze fabrics at the height of summer and away from them as autumn begins.

In Japan, this process of changing clothes is referred to as ''[[Seasonal Wardrobe Change in Japan|koromogae]]''.\\n\\n====Crests====\\nFormality is also determined by the number and type of {{transliteration|ja|[[mon (badge)|mon]]}} or {{transliteration|ja|kamon}} (crests). Five crests ({{transliteration|ja|itsutsu mon}}) are the most formal, three crests ({{transliteration|ja|mitsu mon}}) are mid-formality, and one crest ({{transliteration|ja|hitotsu mon}}) is the least formal, used for occasions such as tea ceremony.

The type of crest adds formality as well. A \\\"full sun\\\" ({{transliteration|ja|hinata}}) crest, where the design is outlined and filled in with white, is the most formal type. A \\\"mid-shadow\\\" ({{transliteration|ja|nakakage}}) crest is mid-formality, with only the outline of the crest visible in white. A \\\"shadow\\\" ({{transliteration|ja|kage}}) crest is the least formal, with the outline of the crest relatively faint. Shadow crests may be embroidered onto the kimono, and full-embroidery crests, called {{transliteration|ja|nui mon}}, are also seen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mon and Kamon |url=https://wafuku.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/mon-kamon-%E2%80%93-japanese-emblem-crests-%E2%80%93-vintage-antique-japanese-kimonos/ |website=wafuku.co.uk |access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\\n\\n====Choice of accessories====\\nFormality can also be determined by the type and colour of accessories.

Though lengths can vary by a few centimetres, these lengths are informally standardised.\\n\\nMen's kimono sleeves are only ever one length, and women's sleeves are limited to a short length suitable for almost all types of kimono, or a longer length used for only one type of formal young women's kimono. In the modern day, the two lengths of women's sleeve worn on kimono are {{transliteration|ja|[[furisode]]}} length, which almost reaches the floor, and a shorter length, used for every other variety of women's kimono.\\n\\nBefore WWII, the length of women's kimono sleeves varied, with sleeves gradually shortening as a woman got older. During WWII, due to shortage of fabric, the 'short' length of women's kimono sleeves became standardised, and post-WWII, the realm of long kimono sleeves was narrowly curtailed to the realm of {{transliteration|ja|furisode}} only \\u2013 formal young women's and girl's kimono, where previously longer sleeves were seen on other varieties of dress, both formal and informal.

Women's {{transliteration|ja|juban}} and can either be patterned or entirely plain, and modern women's {{transliteration|ja|juban}} are frequently white in colour.\\n\\nMen's {{transliteration|ja|juban}} are often dyed in dark colours, and can be made of the same material as the outer kimono, as some kimono fabric bolts ({{transliteration|ja|[[tanmono]]}}) are woven with enough length to accommodate this. Men's {{transliteration|ja|juban}} are frequently more decorative than women's, often featuring a dyed pictorial scene in the upper back, such as a scene from ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.\\n\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, women's {{transliteration|ja|juban}} transitioned from being mostly red with bold white motifs to being white or light pastel colours.

From roughly the mid-1980s onwards, they began to be produced in a wider variety of colours and designs, responding to demand for a more casual kimono that could be worn to a summer festival, and have since become more formal than their previous status as bathrobes, with high-end, less colourful {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} sometimes standing in place of {{transliteration|ja|komon}}.\\n\\nIn the present day, many {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} are brightly coloured, featuring large motifs from a variety of different seasons. For women, they are worn with either a {{transliteration|ja|hanhaba obi}} (half-width {{transliteration|ja|obi}}) or a {{transliteration|ja|heko obi}} (a soft, sash-like {{transliteration|ja|obi}}), and are often accessorised with colourful hair accessories. For men, {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} are worn with either an informal {{transliteration|ja|kaku obi}} or a {{transliteration|ja|heko obi}}. Children generally wear a {{transliteration|ja|heko obi}} with {{transliteration|ja|yukata}}.\\n\\n{{transliteration|ja|Yukata}} are always unlined, and it is possible for women to wear a casual {{transliteration|ja|nagoya obi}} with a high-end, more subdued {{transliteration|ja|yukata}}, often with a {{transliteration|ja|juban}} underneath. A high-end men's {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} could also be dressed up in the same way.\\n\\nA {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} is traditionally worn as a single layer or over a {{transliteration|ja|hadajuban}} (an underkimono worn underneath the {{transliteration|ja|nagajuban}}, featuring a simplified construction). {{transliteration|ja|Yukata}} may also be worn over the top of a t-shirt and shorts. This distinguishes {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} from a more-formal {{transliteration|ja|komon}} kimono, where a {{transliteration|ja|nagajuban}} (also simply referred to as a {{transliteration|ja|juban}}, an underkimono resembling) is worn underneath, showing a second layer of collar at the neckline. However, some modern {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} are worn with collared cotton {{transliteration|ja|juban}} featuring a collar of linen, cotton or {{transliteration|ja|ro}}, for occasions such as informal eating-out.<ref name=mochi_juban/><ref name=mochi_komon/>\\n\\n===={{anchor|Tsumugi}}{{transliteration|ja|Tsumugi}}====\\n{{main|Tsumugi}}\\n\\n[[File:OshimaTsumugiDetail.jpg|thumb|left|Detailed {{nihongo||[[wikt:\\u7d63|\\u7d63]]|[[kasuri]]}} on an [[\\u014cshima-tsumugi]] Kimono]]\\n\\n{{nihongo||[[wikt:\\u7d2c|\\u7d2c]]|[[Tsumugi]]}} are casual silk kimono worn by both men and women. {{transliteration|ja|Tsumugi}} kimono traditionally referred to kimono woven in plain weave with [[silk noil]], short-[[staple (textiles)|staple]] silk fibre, though now include various types of casual silk kimono whereby the pattern is produced by weave as opposed to surface dying.<ref>https://kimonoya3daime.hatenadiary.org/entry/20100207/1265518918</ref> [[Tsumugi]] kimono are often dyed with [[Kasuri]] patterns.<ref>https://www.motoji.co.jp/blogs/artists-origins/oshima-tsumugi</ref>\\n\\n===={{anchor|Komon}}{{transliteration|ja|Komon}}====\\n[[File:Komon.jpg|thumb|A {{transliteration|ja|komon}} with a small, repeating floral pattern]]\\n{{nihongo3|{{lit|small pattern}}, though the patterns may in fact be large|[[wikt:\\u5c0f\\u7d0b|\\u5c0f\\u7d0b]]|Komon}} are informal women's kimono.

Designs can be made with any method; woven patterns, prints, stencilled patterns in alternating orientations, freehand painting ({{transliteration|ja|[[y\\u016bzen]]}}) or tie-dye patterns ({{transliteration|ja|[[shibori]]}}). Traditionally the direction of the fabric was alternated in adjacent panels (necessary due to the lack of shoulder seam), so patterns were generally reversible. If the pattern is the same way up on each panel, the {{transliteration|ja|komon}} is more formal, approaching {{transliteration|ja|tsukesage}}-level formality.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\\n\\nWoven geometric patterns (such as stripes) have no season, but others show images representing the season in general. Woven non-geometric patterns ({{transliteration|ja|[[kasuri]]}}) are also common. Small, dense patterns are often used; this is practical, as fine-scale patterns hides stains.\\n\\n{{transliteration|ja|Komon}} are made with informal materials such as {{transliteration|ja|[[tsumugi]]}} (slubbed silk), cotton, linen, ramie, and hemp. In the modern day, synthetic blends and synthetics are also used; rayon ({{transliteration|ja|jinken}}) and polyester are common.\\n\\nNow that kimono are not typically worn as informal clothing, {{transliteration|ja|komon}} are not worn as often as formal kimono, though they have a wider range of suitable use. {{transliteration|ja|[[#Edo komon|Edo komon]]}} are the most formal type of {{transliteration|ja|komon}}; they may have one to three crests, with a small, fine pattern that appears to be a solid colour from a distance, and so resembles the more formal {{transliteration|ja|iromuji}}.\\n\\n===={{anchor|Edo komon}}{{transliteration|ja|Edo komon}}====\\n[[File:MET 2001 428 40 det komon.jpg|thumb|right|This {{transliteration|ja|edo komon}} pattern is stencil-dyed onto the fabric.]]\\n{{nihongo||[[wikt:\\u6c5f\\u6238\\u5c0f\\u7d0b|\\u6c5f\\u6238\\u5c0f\\u7d0b]]|Edo komon}} are a type of {{transliteration|ja|komon}} worn by women characterised by an extremely small repeating pattern, usually done in white on a coloured background.

The {{transliteration|ja|susohiki}} worn by geisha and their apprentices are formal kimono worn to engagements, and so are always made of fine silk, resembling kimono of {{transliteration|ja|h\\u014dmongi}} formality and above in their pattern placement and background colour.\\n\\nThe {{transliteration|ja|susohiki}} worn by kabuki actors varies by role, and so can appear as the humble clothing of an Edo-period merchant's daughter, as well as the fine silk clothing of a samurai woman. These costumes may be made of polyester, as well as silk, informal silk fabrics, cotton, linen or hemp. Pattern placement, colour and design varies by role, with many roles having costume designs preserved from previous centuries.\\n\\nThe {{transliteration|ja|susohiki}} worn by people performing traditional Japanese dance typically feature a bold design in block colours, as their clothing must stand out from the stage. Performers performing in a group wear kimono identical to one another, with the bold designs creating visual unity between performers.\\n\\n==Related garments and accessories==\\n{{main|List of items traditionally worn in Japan}}\\n\\nThough the kimono is the national dress of Japan, it has never been the sole item of clothing worn throughout Japan; even before the introduction of Western dress to Japan, many different styles of dress were worn, such as the {{transliteration|ain|attus}} of the [[Ainu people]] and the {{transliteration|ryu|ryusou}} of the Ryukyuan people. Though similar to the kimono, these garments are distinguishable by their separate cultural heritage, and are not considered to be simply 'variations' of kimono such as the clothing worn by the working class is considered to be.\\n\\nSome related garments still worn today were the contemporary clothing of previous time periods, and have survived on in an official and/or ceremonial capacity, worn only on certain occasions by certain people.\\n\\nThere are a number of accessories that can be worn with the kimono, and these vary by occasion and use. Some are ceremonial, or worn only for special occasions, whereas others are part of dressing in kimono and are used in a more practical sense.\\n\\nBoth [[Geisha#Appearance|geisha]] and {{transliteration|ja|[[Maiko#Appearance|maiko]]}} wear variations on common accessories that are not found in everyday dress. As an extension of this, many practitioners of [[Japanese traditional dance]] wear similar kimono and accessories to geisha and {{transliteration|ja|maiko}}.\\n\\nFor certain traditional holidays and occasions some specific types of kimono accessories are worn. For instance, {{transliteration|ja|[[okobo]]}}, also known as {{transliteration|ja|pokkuri}}, are worn by girls for {{transliteration|ja|[[shichi-go-san]]}}, alongside brightly coloured {{transliteration|ja|furisode}}. {{transliteration|ja|Okobo}} are also worn by young women on {{transliteration|ja|[[seijin no hi]]}} (Coming of Age Day).\\n\\n==Layering==\\nPre-WW2, kimono were commonly worn layered, with three being the standard number of layers worn over the top of undergarments. The layered kimono underneath were known as {{transliteration|ja|d\\u014dnuki}}, and were often a patchwork of older or unwearable kimono taken apart for their fabric. Specifically-designed matching sets of formal layered kimono were known as {{transliteration|ja|o-tsui}}, and generally featured the same design presented on different background colours, such as white (innermost), red (middle layer) and black (outermost).<ref name=\\\"Taisho Kimono\\\"/>{{rp|42}} The innermost layers, known as {{transliteration|ja|shitagi}}, typically featured the plainest decorative techniques, such as dyework only, and the successive outer layers would feature techniques such as embroidery and couched gold thread, with the outermost layer \\u2013 known as the {{transliteration|ja|uwagi}} \\u2013 displaying the most extensive decoration.<ref name=\\\"Taisho Kimono\\\"/>{{rp|45}} These matching sets would be designed and created together, commonly as part of a bride's outfit for a wedding. Extant intact sets of {{transliteration|ja|o-tsui}} kimono are difficult to find, particularly in good condition, with the innermost kimono typically damaged and in poor condition.<ref name=\\\"Taisho Kimono\\\"/>{{rp|46}}\\n\\nIn modern Japan, at least one layer is typically worn next to the skin when wearing kimono. Traditionally, this would be the {{transliteration|ja|hadagi}} or {{transliteration|ja|hadajuban}}, a tube-sleeved, wrapped-front garment considered to be underwear, though in the modern day, regular underwear is sometimes worn instead, and a traditional {{transliteration|ja|hadajuban}} is not considered strictly necessary. A {{transliteration|ja|hadajuban}} is typically made of something more washable than silk, such as cotton, hemp, linen or some synthetic fibres.\\n\\nFor all forms of kimono except the {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} (excluding high-quality {{transliteration|ja|yukata}} dressed up as {{transliteration|ja|komon}}), a {{nihongo3|{{lit|long {{transliteration|ja|juban}}}}||nagajuban}}, often known and referred to as a {{transliteration|ja|juban}}, is worn over the top of any underwear. The {{transliteration|ja|juban}} resembles a kimono made of a lighter, thinner fabric, not uncommonly constructed without an {{transliteration|ja|okumi}} panel at the front, and often has a collar cover known as a {{transliteration|ja|han'eri}} sewn over its collar. The {{transliteration|ja|han'eri}}, which is visible at the neckline when worn underneath a kimono, is designed to be replaced and washed when needed.<ref name=mochi_juban/>\\n\\nIn modern-day Japan, layered kimono are generally only seen on the stage, whether for classical dances or in kabuki. A false second layer called a {{nihongo3|\\\"second wing\\\"|\\u6bd4\\u7ffc|hiyoku}} may be attached instead of an entirely separate kimono to achieve this look; the {{transliteration|ja|hiyoku}} resembles the lower half of a kimono's lining which, and is sewn to the kimono horizontally along the back. A {{transliteration|ja|hiyoku}} may have a false collar attached to it, or a matching false collar sewn to the kimono separately, creating the illusion of a layered kimono at the neckline; separate false sleeve cuffs may also be sewn into the kimono to create this effect.\\n\\nKimono featuring {{transliteration|ja|hiyoku}} can be seen in some kabuki performances such as {{transliteration|ja|[[Fuji Musume]]}}, where the kimono is worn with the {{transliteration|ja|okumi}} flipped back slightly underneath the {{transliteration|ja|obi}} to expose the design on the {{transliteration|ja|hiyoku}}. The {{transliteration|ja|hiyoku}} can also be seen on some bridal kimono.\\n\\n==Care==\\n[[Image:Kimonofold.jpg|thumb|right|200px|How to fold a kimono]]\\nIn the past, a kimono would often be entirely taken apart for washing, and then re-sewn for wearing.<ref name=\\\"Dalby Geisha\\\"/> This traditional washing method involves two steps: taking the kimono apart and washing each piece ({{transliteration|ja|toki arai}}) and then stretching each piece of a kimono onto a board to dry after they have been washed and starched ({{transliteration|ja|arai hari}}).<ref>{{cite AV media |date=13 August 2022 |script-title=ja:\\u3010\\u5b8c\\u5168\\u89e3\\u8aac\\u3011\\u81ea\\u5b85\\u3067\\u7740\\u7269\\u3092\\u6d17\\u3044\\u5f35\\u308a\\u3057\\u3066\\u307f\\u305f |type=video |language=ja |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=9PxdY317o7U |access-date=8 April 2023 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408102425/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PxdY317o7U |archive-date=8 April 2023 |via=YouTube |publisher=\\u3055\\u3068\\u3057\\u306e\\u548c\\u3061\\u3083\\u3093\\u306d\\u308b }}</ref> Because the stitches must be taken out for washing, traditional kimono need to be hand sewn. The process of traditionally washing kimono is very expensive and difficult and is one of the causes of the declining popularity{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} of kimono. Modern fabrics and cleaning methods have been developed that eliminate this need, although the traditional washing of kimono is still practiced, especially for high-end garments.\\n\\nNew, custom-made kimono are generally delivered to a customer with long, loose [[Tack (sewing)|basting]] stitches placed around the outside edges. These stitches are called {{transliteration|ja|shitsuke ito}} (not to be confused with {{transliteration|ja|kazari jitsuke}}, the small white prickstitching seen along the collar of {{transliteration|ja|kurotomesode}}). They are sometimes replaced for storage. They help to prevent bunching, folding and wrinkling, and keep the kimono's layers in alignment.\\n\\nLike many other traditional Japanese garments, there are specific ways to fold kimono. These methods help to preserve the garment and to keep it from creasing when stored. Kimono are often stored wrapped in acid-free paper envelopes known as {{transliteration|ja|tat\\u014dshi}}.\\n\\nKimono need to be [[Airing (air circulation)|aired out]] at least seasonally and before and after each time they are worn. Many people prefer to have their kimono [[dry cleaning|dry cleaned]]. Although this can be extremely expensive, it is generally less expensive than the traditional method of taking a kimono apart to clean it. This may, however, be impossible for certain fabrics or dyes.\\n\\n=={{transliteration|ja|Sanchi}}, Kimono Production Regions==\\nKimono are produced in different regions all over Japan. Locations known for making kimono are often called {{transliteration|ja|Sanchi}}.

Protons and neutrons constitute the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[atom]]s. Since protons and neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus, they are both referred to as [[nucleon]]s. Nucleons have a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit, or [[dalton (unit)|dalton]] (symbol: Da).  Their properties and interactions are described by [[nuclear physics]].  Protons and neutrons are not [[elementary particle]]s; each is composed of three [[quark]]s.\\n\\nThe [[chemical properties]] of an atom are mostly determined by the configuration of [[electron]]s that orbit the atom's heavy nucleus. The electron configuration is determined by the charge of the nucleus, which is determined by the number of protons, or [[atomic number]]. The number of neutrons is the [[neutron number]]. Neutrons do not affect the electron configuration.\\n\\nAtoms of a [[chemical element]] that differ only in neutron number are called [[isotopes]]. For example, [[carbon]], with atomic number 6, has an abundant isotope [[carbon-12]] with 6 neutrons and a rare isotope [[carbon-13]] with 7 neutrons.  Some elements occur in nature with only one [[stable nuclide|stable isotope]], such as [[fluorine]]. Other elements occur with many stable isotopes, such as [[tin]] with ten stable isotopes, or with no stable isotope, such as [[technetium]].\\n\\nThe properties of an atomic nucleus depend on both atomic and neutron numbers. With their positive charge, the protons within the nucleus are repelled by the long-range [[electromagnetic force]], but the much stronger, but short-range, [[nuclear force]] binds the nucleons closely together. Neutrons are required for the stability of nuclei, with the exception of the single-proton [[hydrogen]] nucleus. Neutrons are produced copiously in [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]]. They are a primary contributor to the [[nucleosynthesis]] of chemical elements within [[star]]s through fission, fusion, and [[neutron capture]] processes.\\n\\nThe neutron is essential to the production of nuclear power. In the decade after the [[Discovery of the neutron|neutron was discovered]] by [[James Chadwick]] in 1932, neutrons were used to induce many different types of [[nuclear transmutation]]s. With the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] in 1938, it was quickly realized that, if a fission event produced neutrons, each of these neutrons might cause further fission events, in a cascade known as a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. These events and findings led to the first self-sustaining [[nuclear reactor]] ([[Chicago Pile-1]], 1942) and the first [[nuclear weapon]] ([[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]], 1945).\\n\\nDedicated [[neutron source]]s like [[neutron generator]]s, [[research reactor]]s and [[spallation|spallation sources]] produce free neutrons for use in [[irradiation]] and in [[neutron scattering]] experiments. A free neutron spontaneously decays to a proton, an [[electron]], and an [[antineutrino]], with a [[Exponential decay#Mean lifetime|mean lifetime]] of about 15 minutes. Free neutrons do not directly ionize atoms, but they do indirectly cause [[ionizing radiation#Neutrons|ionizing radiation]], so they can be a biological hazard, depending on dose. A small natural \\\"neutron background\\\" flux of free neutrons exists on Earth, caused by [[cosmic ray]] [[air shower (physics)|showers]], and by the natural radioactivity of spontaneously fissionable elements in the [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]].\\n\\n== Neutrons in an atomic nucleus ==\\n{{Nuclear physics}}\\nAn [[atomic nucleus]] is formed by a number of protons, ''Z'' (the [[atomic number]]), and a number of neutrons, ''N'' (the [[neutron number]]), bound together by the [[nuclear force]]. Protons and neutrons each have a mass of approximately one [[dalton (unit)|dalton]]. The atomic number determines the [[chemical element|chemical properties]] of the atom, and the neutron number determines the [[isotope]] or [[nuclide]].<ref name=\\\"ENW\\\">{{Citation |editor1-last= Glasstone |editor1-first= Samuel |editor2-last= Dolan |editor2-first= Philip J. |title= The Effects of Nuclear Weapons |edition=3rd |publisher= U.S. Dept. of Defense and Energy Research and Development Administration, U.S. Government Printing Office |date= 1977 |isbn= 978-1-60322-016-3}}</ref>{{rp|4}} The terms isotope and nuclide are often used [[synonym]]ously, but they refer to chemical and nuclear properties, respectively.<ref name=\\\"ENW\\\"/>{{rp|4}} Isotopes are nuclides with the same atomic number, but different neutron number.

When bound within a nucleus, nucleons can [[radioactive decay|decay]] by the beta decay process. The neutrons and protons in a nucleus form a [[introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical system]] according to the [[nuclear shell model]]. Protons and neutrons of a [[nuclide]] are organized into discrete hierarchical [[energy level]]s with unique [[quantum numbers]]. Nucleon decay within a nucleus can occur if allowed by basic energy conservation and quantum mechanical constraints. The decay products, that is, the emitted particles, carry away the energy excess as a nucleon falls from one quantum state to one with less energy, while the neutron (or proton) changes to a proton (or neutron).\\n\\nFor a neutron to decay, the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial neutron state. In stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all filled, meaning each state is occupied by a pair of protons, one with [[Spin (physics)|spin]] up, another with spin down. When all available proton states are filled, the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] disallows the decay of a neutron to a proton.<ref name=\\\"Byrne_NNM\\\">Byrne, J.

But since the masses of a proton and of a [[deuteron]] can be measured with a mass spectrometer, the mass of a neutron can be deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass, with the difference being the mass of the neutron plus the [[binding energy]] of deuterium (expressed as a positive emitted energy). The latter can be directly measured by measuring the energy (<math>B_d</math>) of the single {{val|2.224|u=MeV}} gamma photon emitted when a deuteron is formed by a proton capturing a neutron (this is exothermic and happens with zero-energy neutrons). The small recoil kinetic energy (<math>E_{rd}</math>) of the deuteron (about 0.06% of the total energy) must also be accounted for.\\n: <math>m_n= m_d - m_p + B_d - E_{rd}</math>\\n\\nThe energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by X-ray diffraction techniques, as was first done by Bell and Elliot in 1948.

Neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an ionization track that is detectable, but the experiments are not as simple to carry out; other means for detecting neutrons, consisting of allowing them to interact with atomic nuclei, are more commonly used. The commonly used methods to detect neutrons can therefore be categorized according to the nuclear processes relied upon, mainly [[neutron capture]] or [[elastic scattering]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Ch. 14|title=Radiation Detection and Measurement|author=Knoll, Glenn F.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1979|isbn=978-0471495451|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/radiationdetecti00knol_0}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Neutron detection by neutron capture ===\\nA common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy released from [[neutron capture]] reactions into electrical signals. Certain nuclides have a high neutron capture [[cross section (physics)|cross section]], which is the probability of absorbing a neutron. Upon neutron capture, the compound nucleus emits more easily detectable radiation, for example an alpha particle, which is then detected. The nuclides {{SimpleNuclide|Helium|3}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Lithium|6}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Boron|10}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Uranium|233}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Uranium|235}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Neptunium|237}}, and {{SimpleNuclide|Plutonium|239}} are useful for this purpose. <!-- The following needs correction, errors due to lack of reference: These nuclides are rarely found in nature, but can be accumulated through processes such as isotopic enrichment.\\n\\nThe cross section for the process of neutron capture is much lower at high energies than at low energies. Therefore, the detection of neutrons by neutron capture requires a preceding slowing down of neutrons. For this purpose, a [[neutron moderator]] is used, typically a thick slab of polyethylene. Neutron detectors using the moderate-and-capture approach cannot measure neutron energy, precise time of arrival, or direction of incidence, because this information is lost during moderation. -->\\n\\n=== Neutron detection by elastic scattering ===\\nNeutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei, causing the struck nucleus to recoil. Kinematically, a neutron can transfer more energy to a light nucleus such as hydrogen or helium than to a heavier nucleus. Detectors relying on elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors. Recoiling nuclei can ionize and excite further atoms through collisions. Charge and/or scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal. A major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector. Methods such as pulse shape discrimination can be used in distinguishing neutron signals from gamma-ray signals, although certain inorganic scintillator-based detectors have been developed <ref>{{Cite journal |last = Ghosh |first = P. |author2 = W.

These include certain types of [[radioactive decay]] ([[spontaneous fission]] and [[neutron emission]]), and from certain [[nuclear reaction]]s. Convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop reactions such as natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides, often beryllium or deuterium, and induced [[nuclear fission]], such as occurs in nuclear reactors. In addition, high-energy nuclear reactions (such as occur in cosmic radiation showers or accelerator collisions) also produce neutrons from disintegration of target nuclei. Small (tabletop) [[particle accelerator]]s optimized to produce free neutrons in this way, are called [[neutron generator]]s.\\n\\nIn practice, the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons use radioactive decay to power neutron production. One noted neutron-producing [[radioisotope]], [[californium]]-252 decays (half-life 2.65 years) by [[spontaneous fission]] 3% of the time with production of 3.7 neutrons per fission, and is used alone as a neutron source from this process. [[Nuclear reaction]] sources (that involve two materials) powered by radioisotopes use an [[alpha decay]] source plus a beryllium target, or else a source of high-energy gamma radiation from a source that undergoes [[beta decay]] followed by [[gamma decay]], which produces [[photoneutron]]s on interaction of the high-energy [[gamma ray]] with ordinary stable beryllium, or else with the [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]]. A popular [[startup neutron source|source of the latter type]] is radioactive [[antimony-124]] plus beryllium, a system with a half-life of 60.9 days, which can be constructed from natural antimony (which is 42.8% stable antimony-123) by activating it with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, then transported to where the neutron source is needed.<ref>Byrne, J.

This forms the basis of [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA) and [[prompt gamma neutron activation analysis]] (PGNAA). NAA is most often used to analyze small samples of materials in a [[nuclear reactor]] whilst PGNAA is most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around [[bore hole]]s and industrial bulk materials on conveyor belts.\\n\\nAnother use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei, in particular the hydrogen found in water molecules. When a fast neutron collides with a light nucleus, it loses a large fraction of its energy. By measuring the rate at which slow neutrons return to the probe after reflecting off of hydrogen nuclei, a [[neutron probe]] may determine the water content in soil.\\n\\n== Medical therapies ==\\n{{Main|Fast neutron therapy|Neutron capture therapy of cancer}}\\nBecause neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing, it can be exploited for medical treatments. However, neutron radiation can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving the affected area radioactive. [[Neutron tomography]] is therefore not a viable medical application.\\n\\nFast neutron therapy uses high-energy neutrons typically greater than 20 MeV to treat cancer. [[Radiation therapy]] of cancers is based upon the biological response of cells to ionizing radiation. If radiation is delivered in small sessions to damage cancerous areas, normal tissue will have time to repair itself, while tumor cells often cannot.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hall |first=Eric J. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43854159 |title=Radiobiology for the radiologist |date=2000 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |isbn=0-7817-2649-2 |edition=5th |location=Philadelphia |oclc=43854159 |access-date=2023-03-11 |archive-date=2024-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240512232112/https://search.worldcat.org/title/43854159 |url-status=live }}</ref> Neutron radiation can deliver energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of magnitude larger than [[gamma radiation]].<ref>Johns HE and Cunningham JR (1978). ''The Physics of Radiology''. Charles C Thomas 3rd edition</ref>\\n\\nBeams of low-energy neutrons are used in [[neutron capture therapy of cancer|boron neutron capture therapy]] to treat cancer. In boron neutron capture therapy, the patient is given a drug that contains boron and that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted. The tumor is then bombarded with very low-energy neutrons (although often higher than thermal energy) which are captured by the [[boron-10]] isotope in the boron, which produces an excited state of boron-11 that then decays to produce [[lithium-7]] and an [[alpha particle]] that have sufficient energy to kill the malignant cell, but insufficient range to damage nearby cells. For such a therapy to be applied to the treatment of cancer, a neutron source having an intensity of the order of a thousand million (10<sup>9</sup>) neutrons per second per cm<sup>2</sup> is preferred. Such fluxes require a research nuclear reactor.\\n\\n== Protection ==\\nExposure to free neutrons can be hazardous, since the interaction of neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s, and can also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of [[radiation]] (such as protons).<ref name=\\\"ENW\\\"/> The normal precautions of radiation protection apply: Avoid exposure, stay as far from the source as possible, and keep exposure time to a minimum. But particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure. For other types of radiation, e.g., [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, or [[gamma ray]]s, material of a high atomic number and with high density makes for good shielding; frequently, [[lead]] is used. However, this approach will not work with neutrons, since the absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic number, as it does with alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter (see the section on detection above). For example, [[hydrogen]]-rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons, since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons. This often means that simple concrete blocks or even paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than do far more dense materials. After slowing, neutrons may then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing secondary capture radiation, such as lithium-6.\\n\\nHydrogen-rich [[water|ordinary water]] effects neutron absorption in [[nuclear fission]] reactors: Usually, neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that fuel enrichment with a fissionable isotope is required. (The number of neutrons produced per fission depends primarily on the fission products. The average is roughly 2.5 to 3.0 and at least one, on average, must evade capture in order to sustain the [[nuclear chain reaction]].) The [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]] has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons than does protium (normal light hydrogen). Deuterium is, therefore, used in [[CANDU]]-type reactors, in order to slow ([[neutron moderator|moderate]]) neutron velocity, to increase the probability of [[nuclear fission]] compared to [[neutron capture]].\\n\\n== Neutron temperature ==\\n{{Main|Neutron temperature}}\\n\\n=== Thermal neutrons ===\\n''Thermal neutrons'' are [[free neutron]]s whose energies have a [[Maxwell\\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] with kT&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{val|0.0253|ul=eV}} ({{val|4.0|e=-21|ul=J}}) at room temperature. This gives characteristic (not average, or median) speed of 2.2&nbsp;km/s. The name 'thermal' comes from their energy being that of the room temperature gas or material they are permeating. (see ''[[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]'' for energies and speeds of molecules). After a number of collisions (often in the range of 10\\u201320) with nuclei, neutrons arrive at this energy level, provided that they are not absorbed.\\n\\nIn many substances, thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective cross-section than reactions involving faster neutrons, and thermal neutrons can therefore be absorbed more readily (i.e., with higher probability) by any [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] that they collide with, creating a heavier \\u2013 and often [[unstable isotope|unstable]] \\u2013 [[isotope]] of the [[chemical element]] as a result.\\n\\nMost [[nuclear reactor|fission reactors]] use a [[neutron moderator]] to slow down, or ''thermalize'' the neutrons that are emitted by [[nuclear fission]] so that they are more easily captured, causing further fission. Others, called [[fast breeder]] reactors, use fission energy neutrons directly.\\n\\n=== Cold neutrons ===\\n''Cold neutrons'' are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very cold substance such as liquid [[deuterium]]. Such a ''cold source'' is placed in the moderator of a research reactor or spallation source.

They are named ''fission energy'' or ''fast'' neutrons to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as [[nuclear fission]]. Neutrons produced in fission, as noted above, have a [[Maxwell\\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a mean energy of 2 MeV (for <sup>235</sup>U fission neutrons), and a [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of only 0.75 MeV, which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast (and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in [[fertile material]]s, such as <sup>238</sup>U and <sup>232</sup>Th).\\n\\nFast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called moderation. This is done with a [[neutron moderator]].

The D\\u2013T rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvins) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\\n\\n{{Further|Nuclear fusion#Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions}}\\n\\nD\\u2013T ([[deuterium]]\\u2013[[tritium]]) fusion is the [[D-T fusion|fusion reaction]] that produces the most energetic neutrons, with 14.1&nbsp;[[MeV]] of [[kinetic energy]] and traveling at 17% of the [[speed of light]]. D\\u2013T fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to ignite, reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14.1&nbsp;MeV that will be produced.\\n\\n14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons, and are very effective at fissioning even non-[[fissile]] [[actinides|heavy nuclei]], and these high-energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions by lower-energy neutrons. This makes D\\u2013T fusion neutron sources such as proposed [[tokamak]] power reactors useful for [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of transuranic waste. 14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons can also produce neutrons by [[spallation#Nuclear spallation|knocking them loose from nuclei]].\\n\\nOn the other hand, these very high-energy neutrons are less likely to simply [[neutron capture|be captured without causing fission or spallation]]. For these reasons, [[nuclear weapon design]] extensively uses D\\u2013T fusion 14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons to [[fusion boosting|cause more fission]]. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as [[depleted uranium]] (uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs, such as [[reactor grade plutonium]]. This physical fact thus causes ordinary non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain [[nuclear proliferation]] discussions and treaties.\\n\\nOther fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons. D\\u2013D fusion produces a 2.45&nbsp;MeV neutron and [[helium-3]] half of the time, and produces [[tritium]] and a proton but no neutron the rest of the time. D\\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion produces no neutron.\\n\\n=== Intermediate-energy neutrons ===\\n[[File:Sasahara.svg|thumb|right|300px|Transmutation flow in [[light water reactor]], which is a thermal-spectrum reactor]]\\n\\nA fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal energies is called an epithermal neutron.\\n\\n[[Cross section (physics)|Cross sections]] for both [[neutron capture|capture]] and [[nuclear fission|fission]] reactions often have multiple [[resonance]] peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range. These are of less significance in a [[fast-neutron reactor]], where most neutrons are absorbed before slowing down to this range, or in a well-[[neutron moderator|moderated]] [[thermal reactor]], where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei, not with either [[fissile]] or [[fertile material|fertile]] [[actinide]] nuclides. But in a partially moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons with heavy metal nuclei, there are greater possibilities for [[transient state (chemical engineering)|transient]] changes in [[nuclear chain reaction|reactivity]] that might make reactor control more difficult.\\n\\nRatios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse (more captures without fission) in most [[nuclear fuel]]s such as [[plutonium-239]], making epithermal-spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable, as captures not only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in a [[nuclide]] that is not [[fissile]] with thermal or epithermal neutrons, though still [[fissionable]] with fast neutrons. The exception is [[uranium-233]] of the [[thorium cycle]], which has good capture-fission ratios at all neutron energies.\\n\\n=== High-energy neutrons ===\\nHigh-energy neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are generated as secondary particles by [[particle accelerator]]s or in the atmosphere from [[cosmic ray]]s. These high-energy neutrons are extremely efficient at [[ionization]] and far more likely to cause [[cell (biology)|cell]] death than [[X-ray]]s or protons.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |title= Facing up to secondary neutrons |access-date= 2011-02-08 |author= Freeman, Tami |date= May 23, 2008 |publisher= Medical Physics Web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220151101/http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |archive-date= 2010-12-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title= Expand+Overview of secondary neutron production relevant to shielding in space |journal= [[Radiation Protection Dosimetry]] |year= 2005 |volume= 116 |issue= 1\\u20134 |pages= 140\\u2013143 |doi= 10.1093/rpd/nci033 |pmid= 16604615 |last1= Heilbronn |first1= L. |last2= Nakamura |first2= T |last3= Iwata |first3= Y |last4= Kurosawa |first4= T |last5= Iwase |first5= H |last6= Townsend |first6= LW |url= http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/1nh2s8n5 |access-date= 2019-01-25 |archive-date= 2019-01-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190126060915/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1nh2s8n5 |url-status= live }}</ref>\\n\\n== See also ==\\n{{Commons category}}\\n* [[Ionizing radiation]]\\n* [[Isotope]]\\n* [[List of particles]]\\n* [[Neutron radiation]] and the [[Sievert|Sievert radiation scale]]\\n* [[Neutronium]]\\n* [[Nuclear reaction]]\\n* [[Nucleosynthesis]]\\n** [[Neutron capture nucleosynthesis]]\\n** [[R-process]]\\n** [[S-process]]\\n* [[Thermal-neutron reactor]]\\n\\n=== Neutron sources ===\\n* [[Neutron generator]]\\n* [[Neutron source]]\\n\\n=== Processes involving neutrons ===\\n* [[Neutron bomb]]\\n* [[Neutron diffraction]]\\n* [[Neutron flux]]\\n* [[Neutron transport]]\\n* [[Cosmogenic radionuclide dating]]\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{reflist|25em}}\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n* James Byrne, ''Neutrons, Nuclei and Matter: An Exploration of the Physics of Slow Neutrons''.
