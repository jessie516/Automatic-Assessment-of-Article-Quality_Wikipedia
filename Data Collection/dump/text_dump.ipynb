He was possibly a historical king of the [[Sumer]]ian [[city-state]] of [[Uruk]], who was posthumously [[Apotheosis|deified]]. His rule probably would have taken place sometime in the beginning of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]], {{circa}} 2900 \\u2013 2350 BC, though he became a major figure in Sumerian legend during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] ({{circa|2112|2004 BC}}).\\n\\nTales of Gilgamesh's legendary exploits are narrated in five surviving [[Epic of Gilgamesh#Sumerian poems|Sumerian poems]]. The earliest of these is likely \\\"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\\\",<ref>{{Cite web|title= Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the nether world: translation | publisher = Oxford |url= https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1814.htm|access-date=2021-03-18|website=etcsl}}</ref> in which Gilgamesh comes to the aid of the goddess [[Inanna]] and drives away the creatures infesting her ''huluppu'' tree. She gives him two unknown objects, a ''mikku'' and a ''pikku'', which he loses. After [[Enkidu]]'s death, his [[Shade (mythology)|shade]] tells Gilgamesh about the bleak conditions in the [[Ancient Mesopotamian underworld|Underworld]]. The poem ''[[Gilgamesh and Aga]]'' describes Gilgamesh's revolt against his overlord [[Aga of Kish]]. Other Sumerian poems relate Gilgamesh's defeat of the giant [[Humbaba|Huwawa]] and the [[Bull of Heaven]], while a fifth, poorly preserved poem relates the account of his death and funeral.\\n\\nIn later [[Babylonia]]n times, these stories were woven into a connected narrative. The standard Akkadian ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' was composed by a scribe named [[S\\u00een-l\\u0113qi-unninni]], probably during the [[Kassites|Middle Babylonian Period]] ({{circa|1600|1155 BC}}), based on much older source material. In the epic, Gilgamesh is a [[demigod]] of superhuman strength who befriends the wild man [[Enkidu]]. Together, they embark on many journeys, most famously defeating [[Humbaba]] (Sumerian: Huwawa) and the [[Bull of Heaven]], who is sent to attack them by [[Inanna|Ishtar]] (Sumerian: Inanna) after Gilgamesh rejects her offer for him to become her consort. After Enkidu dies of a disease sent as punishment from the gods, Gilgamesh becomes afraid of his death and visits the sage [[Utnapishtim]], the survivor of the [[Gilgamesh flood myth|Great Flood]], hoping to find [[immortality]]. Gilgamesh repeatedly fails the trials set before him and returns home to Uruk, realizing that immortality is beyond his reach.\\n\\nMost scholars agree that the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' exerted substantial influence on the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', two epic poems written in [[ancient Greek]] during the 8th century BC. The story of Gilgamesh's birth is described in an anecdote in ''On the Nature of Animals'' by the Greek writer [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] (2nd century AD). Aelian relates that Gilgamesh's grandfather kept his mother under guard to prevent her from becoming pregnant, because an oracle had told him that his grandson would overthrow him. She became pregnant and the guards threw the child off a tower, but an eagle rescued him mid-fall and delivered him safely to an orchard, where the gardener raised him.\\n\\nThe ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' was rediscovered in the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] in 1849. After being translated in the early 1870s, it caused widespread controversy due to similarities between portions of it and the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Gilgamesh remained mostly obscure until the mid-20th century, but, since the late 20th century, he has become an increasingly prominent figure in modern culture.\\n\\n==Name==\\n[[File:Archibald Sayce's and Theophilus Pinches' interpretation of the new name of Gilgamesh, in 1890.png|thumb|''Exit Gi\\u0161\\u021bubar!''

It is generally concluded that the name itself translates as \\\"the (kinsman) is a hero\\\", though what type of \\\"kinsman\\\" was meant is a point of controversy.

The [[ZIP code]] is 70447.\\n\\n== History ==\\nMadisonville was founded by [[Jean Baptiste Baham]] in 1800, before the United States acquired this area,  as the town of \\\"Coquille\\\" or \\\"Cokie\\\" because of the abundance of shells in the area, at the site of the Native American village of \\\"Chiconcte\\\". The town was renamed in honor of US President [[James Madison]] around 1811.<ref>{{cite web\\n|author=Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism\\n|url=http://www.stoppingpoints.com/louisiana/St.-Tammany/Madisonville/\\n|title=Madisonville Historical Marker\\n}}</ref>\\n\\nMadisonville was a notable port, providing bricks and other products of the towns along the [[Tchefuncte River]] to [[New Orleans]], in the decades before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the [[Capture of New Orleans]] by the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union Army]], this area remained under nominal [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] control; and the cutoff of trade with New Orleans across enemy lines was devastating to the local economy, which did not recover for decades after the peace.\\n\\nThe opening of the [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] and associated highways gradually brought Madisonville into the sphere of [[New Orleans metropolitan area|Greater New Orleans]], in the second half of the 20th century.\\n\\nMuch of the town flooded with the [[Lake Pontchartrain]] storm surge of [[Hurricane Katrina]], on August 29, 2005. The police/fire station and the town hall were damaged by the flood waters. The town flooded again in 2012 during [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)|Hurricane Isaac]].  Town buildings were again repaired but the police station was moved to a historic building at the intersection of Covington, St. John and Cedar Streets.  The fire station later moved to a new building on Hwy. 22 just west of the town center.\\n\\n===Jahncke shipyard===\\nFrederick (Fritz) Jahncke emigrated to New Orleans from [[Hamburg]], Germany in 1870. After working as a mason, he started a business that built the first sidewalks in New Orleans. Jahncke expanded; using a rented steam-driven hydraulic suction dredge, his firm was the first to extract sand and shell from the Tchefuncte and other rivers to make concrete used in expanding New Orleans.\\n\\nJahncke purchased a half-interest in the Baham Shipyard, entering into shipbuilding. In 1905 he purchased the remaining interest, acquiring land for yards, as well as warehouses, docks, storage facilities and equipment. He died in 1911 and the company passed to [[Ernest Lee Jahncke|Ernest Lee]], Paul F. and Walter F. Jahncke. In 1917, the company started building five wooden ships for the US Navy for [[World War I]]. Two ships were completed \\u2013 the ''SS Bayou Teche'', which was launched in March 1918, and the ''SS Balabac'' on September 29, 1918. The war ended November 11, 1918, and three of the ships were not completed. The ''SS Abbeville'' was completed on January 19, 1919, and the ''SS Pontchartrain'' on April 6, 1919. The last ship was hauled across the river and burned. Part of the hull is still visible at low tide.<ref>[http://www.insidenorthside.com/the-jahncke-shipyard-building-a-place-in-history/ Jahncke shipyard] Retrieved January 6, 2017.</ref>\\n\\n==Geography==\\n[[File:Madisonville Louisiana waterfront west side north from LA 22 bridge.JPG|thumb|left|Madisonville's waterfront, viewed from the drawbridge on [[LA 22]], features outdoor dining along the Tchefuncte River estuary.]]\\n\\nThe town of Madisonville is located on the banks of the Tchefuncte River, near where the river enters [[Lake Pontchartrain]].

Jerry notices that Pookie is different, unpredictable: she even lies to a nun on the bus so she can sit closer to him.\\n\\nAs Jerry settles into college life, the aggressive Pookie arrives unannounced one Saturday morning. The two spend time together over the weekend, and soon see each other regularly. Jerry falls for Pookie, but their different personalities keep them apart. They agree to have sex, but Pookie later tells Jerry she might be pregnant. When the pregnancy scare is over, Jerry decides to spend [[spring break]] alone to catch up on studies. But Pookie pleads with him to stay until he relents.\\n\\nA week alone with the needy, somewhat unstable Pookie makes Jerry realize they need time apart. Later he discovers she has dropped out of school. In time, he finds her in the same boarding house she had rented the first time she visited him. He puts her on a bus for home and, for now, the young lovers part their ways.\\n\\n==Cast==\\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as Mary Ann \\\"Pookie\\\" Adams\\n* [[Wendell Burton]] as Jerry Payne\\n* [[Tim McIntire]] as Charlie Schumacher\\n\\n==Production==\\nMuch of ''The Sterile Cuckoo'' was filmed at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]]. Some of it was filmed in [[Sylvan Beach, New York]], including the [[Sylvan Beach Union Chapel]]. Some scenes, including the later bus-stop scenes, were filmed at the central park in Vernon Center, New York.

Jerry notices that Pookie is different, unpredictable: she even lies to a nun on the bus so she can sit closer to him.\\n\\nAs Jerry settles into college life, the aggressive Pookie arrives unannounced one Saturday morning. The two spend time together over the weekend, and soon see each other regularly. Jerry falls for Pookie, but their different personalities keep them apart. They agree to have sex, but Pookie later tells Jerry she might be pregnant. When the pregnancy scare is over, Jerry decides to spend [[spring break]] alone to catch up on studies. But Pookie pleads with him to stay until he relents.\\n\\nA week alone with the needy, somewhat unstable Pookie makes Jerry realize they need time apart. Later he discovers she has dropped out of school. In time, he finds her in the same boarding house she had rented the first time she visited him. He puts her on a bus for home and, for now, the young lovers part their ways.\\n\\n==Cast==\\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as Mary Ann \\\"Pookie\\\" Adams\\n* [[Wendell Burton]] as Jerry Payne\\n* [[Tim McIntire]] as Charlie Schumacher\\n\\n==Production==\\nMuch of ''The Sterile Cuckoo'' was filmed at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]].
