It has been struck intermittently since 1820, though as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse, [[Benedetto Pistrucci]]'s portrayal of [[St George and the Dragon]], which has traditionally been used on the [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]], or one-pound gold coin.\\n\\nThe five-pound piece was one of the original denominations of gold coins authorised as part of the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]]. It was not struck until 1820, and then only as a [[pattern coin]]. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction of [[Una and the Lion]] by [[William Wyon]]. Although the Una coin was for sale for almost half a century at the [[Royal Mint]], only about 400 are believed to have been struck.\\n\\nIn 1887, it was struck for the first time for circulation, and this also took place in 1893 and 1902, though few actually circulated; examples struck in 1911 were only available as part of a [[proof set]]. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in very small numbers at the [[Sydney Mint]], with examples bearing its [[mint mark]] S. The examples struck in preparation for the coinage of [[Edward VIII]] are highly prized; one sold in 2021 for \\u00a31,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.\\n\\nSince 1980, the five-pound gold piece has been struck in most years by the Royal Mint for sale to collectors and holders of [[bullion]]. Although generally featuring Pistrucci's design, commemorative versions have been issued, such as in 2022, as a memorial following the [[death of Elizabeth II]], featuring the bust of her son and successor, [[Charles III]].\\n\\n== Origins ==\\n{{for|further information regarding the beginnings and history of the modern sovereign coinage, as well as discussion of the St George and dragon reverse design|Sovereign (British coin)}}\\n{{Featured article}}\\n\\nThe [[Five Guineas (British coin)|five guinea]] gold coin started out in 1668 as a coin worth one hundred [[shilling (English coin)|shillings]] (five pounds), and was sometimes called a five-pound coin. This was before the fluctuating value of the [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]] settled at twenty-one [[shilling (British coin)|shillings]] in 1717. According to Richard Lobel, in his ''Coincraft's Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins'', there is some argument that the five-pound piece issued after the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]] was merely a continuation of the earlier coin, which had last been struck in 1753. However, Lobel separates the two series in his catalogue.{{sfn|Lobel|pp=421, 426\\u2013427}}\\n\\nAfter the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], by the [[Coinage Act 1816]], placed Britain officially on the [[gold standard]], with the pound to be defined as a given quantity of gold. Almost every speaker supported having a coin valued at twenty shillings, rather than continuing to use the guinea.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=52\\u201355}} One reason for the introduction of gold coinage based on the sovereign was that its value, equal to one pound sterling, was more convenient than the guinea, equal to twenty-one shillings.{{sfn|Seaby|p=147}} Nevertheless, the Coinage Act did not specify which coins the Mint should strike.{{sfn|Seaby|pp=116\\u2013117}}\\n\\nA committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] recommended gold coins of ten shillings, twenty shillings, [[double sovereign|two pounds]] and five pounds be issued, and this was accepted by [[George, Prince Regent]] on 3{{nbs}}August 1816.{{sfn|Marsh|p=7}} The twenty-shilling piece was named a sovereign, with the resurrection of [[sovereign (English coin)|the old name]] possibly promoted by antiquarians with [[numismatic]] interests.{{sfn|Clancy|p=57}} The sovereign and [[half sovereign]] were both first issued in 1817, but there was initially no striking of the two larger coins.{{sfn|Spink 2004|pp=389\\u2013390}} Since 1754, there had been no issuance of coins more valuable than a guinea intended for general circulation; the need for higher value tender had been met by bank notes.{{sfn|Bull|p=3}} The [[St George and the dragon]] design was suggested as an appropriate motif for the sovereign by its creator, [[Benedetto Pistrucci]], based on a [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] he had carved.{{sfn|Clancy|p=58}}\\n\\n== Early issues ==\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = 1820 five pounds obverse.jpeg\\n | image2 = 1820 five pounds reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = George III five-pound piece\\n | alt1 = Gold coin showing a man's bust\\n| alt2= Gold coin showing a naked man, intended to be a knight, battling a dragon\\n}}\\nThe first striking of the five-pound denomination after the coinage reform was in 1820 as a [[pattern coin]], depicting [[George III]] ({{reign|1760|1820}}). The obverse shows the right-facing bust of the king with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|GEORGIUS III D G BRITANNIAR REX F D}}}} (George III by the grace of God king of the Britains, defender of the faith) and the date, while the reverse shows Pistrucci's George and dragon design with no legend or date. This design had first appeared on the sovereign in 1817, surrounded by a [[Order of the Garter|Garter]].{{sfn|Lobel|p=453}} The design has Pistrucci's surname at the lower left, with the initials of the master of the Mint, [[William Wellesley-Pole]], near the broken spear.{{sfn|Bull|p=2}}\\n\\nLobel, in describing the 1820 five-pound piece, noted that on a copy of G. F. Crowther's 1887 book, ''A Guide to English Pattern Coins'' presented to an unknown person with the publisher's compliments, there is a pencil notation that work on the 1820 piece was completed a few days before George III's death, and after Pistrucci, walking home on the day the king died, heard church bells announcing the demise. He then returned to the [[Royal Mint]] and instructed that some five-pound coins be struck the next morning. Lobel described this as a \\\"fascinating episode of numismatic history\\\".{{sfn|Lobel|p=717}} The numismatist [[Edward Hawkins (numismatist)|Edward Hawkins]], writing in 1850, also wrote dramatically, describing what he deemed heroic efforts to ensure that the pattern double sovereigns and five-pound coins were actually struck before the king died, but [[William John Hocking]] and others have since studied the matter, concluding the coinage dies were not completed until after the king's death on 29 January. The approximately 25 specimens were distributed among Royal Mint officials, prominent numismatists and other important people of the day, as well as given to the Royal Mint and [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Bull|pp=3\\u20134}} One sold in October 2021 for about \\u00a3635,000.{{sfn|Bull|p=6}}\\n\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = 1826 five pounds obverse.jpg\\n | image2 = 1826 five pounds reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = George IV five-pound piece\\n | alt1 = Gold coin showing a man's bust\\n| alt2= Gold coin showing a heraldic shield\\n}}\\nThe next appearance of the denomination was in the reign of [[George IV]] ({{reign|1820|1830}}), in 1826, included in the [[proof set]] of that year. One piece is known dated 1829. The obverse shows the left-facing bust of the king with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA}}}} (George IV by the grace of God&nbsp;...) while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a mantle cape with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF}}}} (King of the Britains, defender of the faith). The 1826 coin has the edge inscription {{lang|la|{{small|DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI SEPTIMO}}}} (An ornament and a safeguard; seventh year of the reign), while the 1829 coin has a plain edge. No five-pound coins were issued during the reign of [[William IV]] ({{reign|1830|1837}}).{{sfn|Lobel|p=427}}\\n\\n==Victoria five-pound coins==\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = Una and lion obverse.jpeg\\n | image2 = Una and lion reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = \\\"Una and the Lion\\\" piece\\n | alt1 = Gold coin showing a woman's bust\\n| alt2= Gold coin showing a woman leading a lion\\n}}\\nThe next coin of this value did not appear until early in the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] ({{reign|1837|1901}}), when what Lobel deems one of the most famous and attractive of all British coins was produced. This piece, known as the ''[[Una and the Lion]]'' coin, is described by him as having \\\"cult status\\\".{{sfn|Lobel|p=427}} Una and the Lion appear in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s 16th century epic ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''.

The Royal Mint had decided to make as few changes as possible for King Edward's coinage, and the Pistrucci reverse continued for the gold coins. Five-pound coins were issued both at face value and in the proof sets issued to commemorate the [[coronation of Edward VII]].

Following extensive correspondence between the king and the [[chancellor of the exchequer]], [[Neville Chamberlain]], Edward got his way, and pattern coins bearing a left-facing bust of the king by [[Thomas Humphrey Paget]] were struck. The Pistrucci reverse was used, but [[Abdication of Edward VIII|the king's abdication]] in December 1936 ended the preparations.

The 1953 strikings bore an obverse legend of {{lang|la|{{small|ELIZABETH II DEI GRA BRITT OMN REGINA F D}}}} (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all the Britains, defender of the faith) but this was changed for 1957, removing {{lang|la|{{small|BRITT OMN}}}} (of all the Britains).{{sfn|Lobel|p=430}} This change was made to acknowledge the evolving [[British Commonwealth]], which by then contained some republics.{{sfn|Seaby|p=172}} The resulting wording continued to be used on Elizabeth's coinage, with variations in the abbreviations.{{sfn|Marsh|pp=96\\u2013106}} \\n\\nNo further \\u00a35 gold pieces were struck until 1980, nine years after decimalisation.{{sfn|Lobel|pp=430\\u2013431}} The Royal Mint realised there was a market for sovereign coins, and began to sell them to collectors at well over face or [[bullion]] value.{{sfn|Bull|p=305}} Beginning in 1980, five-pound gold coins were sold every year, except 1983, sometimes in a four-piece proof set with the half sovereign, sovereign and double sovereign, and sometimes sold individually.

Pieces up to 1984 used an obverse portrait of Elizabeth by [[Arnold Machin]], and later ones up to 1997 by [[Raphael Maklouf]], excepting the 1989 issue, which featured special designs by [[Bernard Sindall]] in honour of the 500th anniversary of the sovereign coin.{{sfn|Lobel|pp=430\\u2013431}}{{sfn|Spink 2004|pp=475, 482}}{{sfn|Spink 2017|pp=105\\u2013106}}\\n\\nFrom 1998, a new obverse portrait of Elizabeth by [[Ian Rank-Broadley]] was used on the five-pound piece.{{sfn|Spink 2017|p=106}} This was used up to 2015.

Its name is the [[latin]]ization of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[krater]]'', a type of [[cup]] used to water down [[wine]]. One of the 48 constellations listed by the second-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], it depicts a cup that has been associated with the god [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] and is perched on the back of [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] the water snake.\\n\\nThere is no [[star]] brighter than third [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] in the constellation. Its two brightest stars, [[Delta Crateris]] of magnitude 3.56 and [[Alpha Crateris]] of magnitude 4.07, are ageing orange [[giant star]]s that are cooler and larger than the [[Sun]]. [[Beta Crateris]] is a [[binary star]] system composed of a white giant star and a [[white dwarf]]. Seven star systems have been found to host [[Exoplanet|planets]]. A few notable [[galaxies]], including [[Crater 2]] and [[NGC 3981]], and a famous [[quasar]] lie within the borders of the constellation.\\n\\n==Mythology==\\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Noctua, Corvus, Crater, Sextans Urani\\u00e6, Hydra, Felis, Lupus, Centaurus, Antlia Pneumatica, Argo Navis, and Pyxis Nautica.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Corvus, Crater, and other constellations seen around Hydra, from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).

He told how the city of Eleusa near [[Troy]] was beset by plague. Its ruler Demiphon consulted an oracle which decreed that a maiden should be sacrificed each year. Demiphon declared that he would choose a maiden by lottery, but he did not include his own daughters. One nobleman, Mastusius, objected, forcing Demiphon to sacrify his daughter. Later, Mastusius killed Demiphon's daughters and tricked the ruler in drinking a cup containing a mixture of their blood and wine. Upon finding out the deed, the king ordered Mastusius and the cup to be thrown into the sea.

It is a [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] that is [[density|denser]] than most common materials. Lead is [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness#Intermediate hardness|soft]] and [[malleable]], and also has a relatively low [[melting point]]. When freshly cut, lead is a shiny gray with a hint of blue. It [[tarnish]]es to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any [[stable nuclide|stable element]] and three of its [[isotope]]s are endpoints of major nuclear [[decay chain]]s of heavier elements.\\n\\nLead is a relatively unreactive [[post-transition metal]]. Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its [[amphoteric]] nature; lead and [[lead oxide]]s react with [[acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|bases]], and it tends to form [[covalent bond]]s. [[Compounds of lead]] are usually found in the +2 [[oxidation state]] rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the [[carbon group]]. Exceptions are mostly limited to [[organolead compound]]s. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to [[catenation|bond with itself]]; it can form chains and polyhedral structures.\\n\\nSince lead is easily extracted from its [[ore]]s, prehistoric people in the Near East [[metals of antiquity|were aware of it]]. [[Galena]] is a principal ore of lead which often bears silver.  Interest in silver helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in [[ancient Rome]]. Lead production declined after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] and did not reach comparable levels until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Lead played a crucial role in the development of the [[printing press]], as [[movable type]] could be relatively easily cast from lead alloys.{{sfn|Theodore Low De Vinne|1899|pp=9\\u201336}} In 2014, the annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, [[ductility]] and relative inertness to [[oxidation]] make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, [[lead\\u2013acid batteries|batteries]], bullets and [[lead shot|shot]], weights, [[solder]]s, [[pewter]]s, [[fusible alloy]]s, [[lead paint|white paints]], [[leaded gasoline]], and [[lead shielding|radiation shield]]ing.\\n\\nLead is a [[neurotoxin]] that accumulates in soft tissues and bones. It damages the [[nervous system]] and interferes with the function of biological [[enzyme]]s, causing [[neurological disorder]]s ranging from behavioral problems to brain damage, and also affects general health, cardiovascular, and renal systems. [[lead poisoning|Lead's toxicity]] was first documented by ancient Greek and Roman writers, who noted some of the symptoms of lead poisoning, but became widely recognized in Europe in the late 19th century.\\n\\n== Physical properties ==\\n\\n=== Atomic ===\\nA lead [[atom]] has 82 [[electron]]s, arranged in an [[electron configuration]] of &#91;[[xenon|Xe]]&#93;4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>6p<sup>2</sup>. The sum of lead's first and second [[ionization energy|ionization energies]]\\u2014the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons\\u2014is close to that of [[tin]], lead's upper neighbor in the [[carbon group]]. This is unusual; ionization energies generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer electrons become more distant from the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]], and more [[shielding effect|shielded]] by smaller orbitals.\\n\\nThe sum of the first four ionization energies of lead exceeds that of tin,{{sfn|Lide|2005|p=10-179}} contrary to what [[periodic trends]] would predict. This is explained by [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which become significant in heavier atoms,{{sfn|Pyykk\\u00f6|1988|pp=563\\u2013594}} which contract s and p orbitals such that lead's 6s electrons have larger binding energies than its 5s electrons.{{sfn|Claudio|Godwin|Magyar|2002|pp=1\\u2013144}} A consequence is the so-called [[inert pair effect]]: the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding, stabilising the +2 [[oxidation state]] and making the distance between nearest atoms in [[crystalline]] lead unusually long.{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=36}}\\n\\nLead's lighter carbon group [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] form stable or metastable [[allotrope]]s with the tetrahedrally coordinated and [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] [[diamond cubic]] structure. The energy levels of their outer [[s-orbital|s-]] and [[p-orbital]]s are close enough to allow mixing into four [[orbital hybridisation|hybrid]] sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=226\\u2013227, 374}} Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms [[metallic bonding|metallic bonds]] in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions. Lead consequently has a [[cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] structure{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=867}} like the similarly sized{{sfn|Slater|1964}} [[divalent]] metals [[calcium]] and [[strontium]].{{sfn|Considine|Considine|2013|pp=501, 2970}}{{efn|The tetrahedral allotrope of tin is called \\u03b1- or gray tin and is stable only at or below 13.2&nbsp;\\u00b0C (55.8&nbsp;\\u00b0F). The stable form of tin above this temperature is called \\u03b2- or white tin and has a distorted face centered cubic (tetragonal) structure which can be derived by compressing the tetrahedra of gray tin along their cubic axes. White tin effectively has a structure intermediate between the regular tetrahedral structure of gray tin, and the regular face centered cubic structure of lead, consistent with the general trend of increasing metallic character going down any representative group.{{sfn|Parth\\u00e9|1964|p=13}}}}{{efn|A [[quasicrystal]]line [[thin-film]] allotrope of lead, with pentagonal symmetry, was reported in 2013.

The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. The inert pair effect is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity, such as carbon in organolead compounds. In these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization is still energetically favorable.

Typically they are removed in a series of [[Pyrometallurgy|pyrometallurgical processes]]. The melt is treated in a [[reverberatory furnace]] with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the impurities except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float to the [[dross|top of the melt]] and are skimmed off.{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=25}}{{sfn|Primary Lead Refining}} Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the [[Parkes process]], in which zinc is added to lead.

Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of lead [[fluorosilicate]] (PbSiF<sub>6</sub>). Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution.{{sfn|Primary Lead Refining}}{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=34}} This is a high-cost process and thus mostly reserved for refining bullion containing high percentages of impurities.{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=23}}\\n\\n==== Direct process ====\\nIn this process, lead bullion and [[slag]] is obtained directly from lead concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming lead monoxide.

It does so by binding to the [[sulfhydryl group]]s found on many enzymes,{{sfn|Rudolph|Rudolph|Hostetter|Lister|2003|p=369}} or mimicking and displacing other metals which act as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] in many enzymatic reactions.{{sfn|Dart|Hurlbut|Boyer-Hassen|2004|p=1426}} The essential metals that lead interacts with include calcium, iron, and zinc.{{sfn|Kosnett|2006|p=238}} High levels of calcium and iron tend to provide some protection from lead poisoning; low levels cause increased susceptibility.{{sfn|Luckey|Venugopal|1979|pp=177\\u2013178}}\\n\\n=== Effects ===\\nLead can cause severe damage to the brain and kidneys and, ultimately, death. By mimicking calcium, lead can cross the [[blood\\u2013brain barrier]]. It degrades the [[myelin]] sheaths of [[neuron]]s, reduces their numbers, interferes with [[neurotransmitter|neurotransmission]] routes, and decreases neuronal growth.{{sfn|Rudolph|Rudolph|Hostetter|Lister|2003|p=369}} In the human body, lead inhibits [[porphobilinogen synthase]] and [[ferrochelatase]], preventing both [[porphobilinogen]] formation and the incorporation of iron into [[protoporphyrin IX]], the final step in [[heme]] synthesis. This causes ineffective heme synthesis and [[microcytic anemia]].{{sfn|Cohen|Trotzky|Pincus|1981|pp=904\\u2013906}}\\n<!--At lower levels, it acts as a calcium analog, interfering with ion channels during nerve conduction.

Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body; for ingestion, the rate is 20\\u201370%, with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults.{{sfn|Tarrag\\u00f3|2012|p=16}}\\n\\nPoisoning typically results from ingestion of food or water contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint.{{sfn|Toxicological Profile for Lead|2007|p=4}} Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters.{{sfn|Bremner|2002|p=101}} Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, [[lead paint]], and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.{{sfn|Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|2007}}\\n\\nThe use of lead for water pipes is [[plumbosolvency|a problem in areas with soft or acidic water]].{{sfn|Thornton|Rautiu|Brush|2001|p=17}} Hard water forms insoluble protective layers on the inner surface of the pipes, whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes.{{sfn|Moore|1977|pp=109\\u2013115}} Dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] in the carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead [[bicarbonate]]; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as [[lead(II) hydroxide]]. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The [[hard water|harder the water]] the more [[calcium bicarbonate]] and [[calcium sulfate|sulfate]] it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.{{sfn|Wiberg|Wiberg|Holleman|2001|p=914}}\\n\\n[[File:Kymographic recording of the effect of lead on frog heart..jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Kymograph]]ic recording of the effect of lead acetate on frog heart experimental set up]]\\n\\nIngestion of applied lead-based paint is the major source of exposure for children:\\na direct source is chewing on old painted window sills.

Impressed by the duo's work on the script for the 1989 film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Greenblatt suggested they develop a series that bore the tone and style of vintage [[Serial film|movie serials]]. The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. ''Brisco'' was one of the last television shows to be filmed on the [[Warner Bros.]] Western backlot. [[Randy Edelman]] composed the distinctive theme music, which has been reused by [[NBC]] during its coverage of the [[1997 World Series]] and the  [[Olympic Games]].\\n\\nDuring its broadcast run, ''The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.'' garnered a small but dedicated following and was well received by critics.<ref name=\\\"briscotvguidesoswin\\\">{{cite journal | title = Brisco County Jr. Wins TV Guide's S.O.S.

[[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber barons]] control the financial and industrial interests of the West from the boardrooms of San Francisco's Westerfield Club. The famous [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Brisco County, Sr. ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) has apprehended a gang of outlaws and its leader, the notorious John Bly ([[Billy Drago]]). While transporting them to stand trial, County is murdered and the gang escapes. Meanwhile, in a nearby mine, a group of shackled Chinese workers unearths \\\"The Orb\\\", a large golden globe studded with rods. A worker draws one of the rods from out of the Orb, then touches several of his co-workers with it. As each worker is touched with the rod he is imbued with superhuman strength which they use to break the iron chains binding them, thus freeing themselves.<ref name=\\\"pilot_episode\\\">David Simkins (writer) & [[Bryan Spicer]] (director), \\\"Pilot\\\". \\\"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\\\", [[Fox Network|Fox]].

Another bounty hunter, Lord Bowler ([[Julius Carry]]), who is known for his expert tracking skills, also hopes to capture Bly. Bitter over the elder County's fame, Bowler treats Brisco as a rival. The two men often find themselves reluctantly joining forces to achieve a common goal. Later in the series, Brisco and Bowler work together as partners and friends.<ref name='dvd_verdict' />\\n\\nIn the pilot episode, Brisco tracks John Bly's second-in-command, Big Smith ([[M. C.

Brisco, Bowler and Socrates hunt the rest of Bly's gang in subsequent episodes.

Carry said that Bowler was similar to the real-life black deputy U.S. Marshal [[Bass Reeves]], in that \\\"Reeves always got his man and would often pull off incredible tricks to bring people in.\\\" Carry knew Clemenson from the time they worked together on the Western television pilot ''Independence''. He had no knowledge of Campbell, but approved of the choice for the leading man after watching ''[[Army of Darkness]]''.

They followed Cuse's informal instruction that the tone of the show remain \\\"just under over-the-top\\\": the series would be humorous but not too [[Camp (style)|campy]]. Every member of the staff participated in breaking down and analyzing the stories they conceived. Worth commented, \\\"there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in the room and got translated to paper that worked when you put them on film.

Each episode of ''Brisco'' was filmed in seven days, so the turn-around time for scripts was one week.<ref name=\\\"briscowritersroom\\\"/> McNamara said that he became a \\\"student of TV history\\\" while writing for ''Brisco'', reviewing old episodes of ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' for inspiration on using humor in the Western genre. He said the writing team felt the television audience was ready for a \\\"trans-genre form\\\", because much of the audience grew up with ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', and ''[[The Wild Wild West]]''.<ref name=\\\"mcnamara_interview\\\">{{cite book | last1 = Longworth | first1 = James L. | title = TV creators: conversations with America's top producers of television drama | volume = 2 | publisher = Syracuse University Press | year = 2002 | location = Syracuse, New York | pages = 258\\u2013259 | isbn = 0-8156-0702-4}}</ref> Researchers Lynnette Porter and Barry Porter acknowledge the writer's familiarity with [[Mark Twain]]'s novel ''[[Pudd'nhead Wilson]]''.

Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized \\\"pirate ship on wheels\\\". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the [[production designers]] could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said it was better to \\\"shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it\\\". He elaborated on this, saying, \\\"if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go back from that, you'll always end up with more than if you start out with a pirate on a horse.\\\"<ref name=\\\"briscowritersroom\\\" />\\n\\nAs the series progressed during its broadcast season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements.

The main horse was Copper, chosen by veteran [[Wrangler (profession)|wrangler]] Gordon Spencer because it was calm and gentle. Campbell nicknamed the horse \\\"Leadbelly\\\" due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes. Another horse, Boss, was used for long-range shots, chase scenes, and elaborate stunts, such as leaps through windows. Ace was called in when the crew had to shoot scenes in which the horse reared. Near the end of the season, a horse named Comet was trained, its name chosen so that the horse would get used to hearing it on set.<ref name=\\\"encyclopedia_tv_pets\\\" /> The \\\"true show horse\\\" was Strip, which was adept at doing tricks, such as lip movements, head nods, and hoof stamping. According to Spencer, all those stunts \\\"as well as tying the knots and opening the door and going into rooms and all of that\\\" were done by Strip. For these scenes, Spencer would stand off-camera and use a stick to signal Strip. Campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and filled it with grain to reward Strip after every take.<ref name=\\\"bruceautobiography\\\" /> No other horse had more scenes than Strip and Copper.

It has been described as the greatest political and [[constitutional crisis]] in Australian history.\\n\\nThe Labor Party under [[Gough Whitlam]] came to power in the [[1972 Australian federal election|election of 1972]], ending 23 consecutive years of [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal-Country Coalition]] government. Labor won a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] of 67 seats to the Coalition's 58 seats, but faced a hostile [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. In May 1974, after the Senate voted to reject six of Labor's non-supply bills, Whitlam advised then-Governor General, Sir [[Paul Hasluck]], to call a [[1974 Australian federal election|double dissolution election]]. The election saw Labor re-elected with its House of Representatives majority reduced from 9 to 5 seats, although it gained seats in the Senate. With the two houses of Parliament still deadlocked, pursuant to section 57 of the [[Australian Constitution]], Whitlam was able to narrowly secure passage of the six \\\"trigger bills\\\" of the earlier double dissolution election in a [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|joint sitting of Parliament]] on 6\\u20137 August 1974, the only such sitting held in Australia's history.\\n\\nWhitlam's tenure in office proved highly turbulent and controversial, and in October 1975, the Opposition under [[Malcolm Fraser]] used its control of the Senate to defer passage of [[appropriation bill]]s needed to finance government expenditure, which had already been passed by the House of Representatives. Fraser and the Opposition stated that they would continue to [[Loss of supply|block supply]] in the Senate unless Whitlam called a fresh election for the House of Representatives, and urged Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], who had been appointed governor-general on Whitlam's advice in July 1974, to dismiss Whitlam unless Whitlam acceded to their demand. Whitlam believed that Kerr would not dismiss him as prime minister, and Kerr did nothing to make Whitlam believe that he might be dismissed.\\n\\nOn 11 November 1975, the crisis came to a head as Whitlam went to seek Kerr's approval to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the parliamentary deadlock. Kerr did not accept Whitlam's request, and instead dismissed him as prime minister and appointed the leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser, as [[Caretaker government of Australia|caretaker prime minister]] on the understanding that Fraser would immediately call a general election. Acting quickly before all ALP parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his parliamentary allies were able to secure passage of the supply bills through the Senate and advised Kerr to dissolve Parliament for a [[double dissolution]] election. Fraser and his Liberal-Country Coalition were elected with a massive majority in the [[1975 Australian federal election|federal election held the following month]].\\n\\nThe events of the Dismissal led to only minor constitutional change. The Senate retained its power to block supply, and the governor-general the power to dismiss government ministers; however, these powers have not since been used to force a government from office. <!--The following sentence has been discussed: do not remove without consensus-->Despite being denied by both Kerr and Whitlam, allegations have repeatedly been made about [[Alleged CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal|CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal]], but remain unsubstantiated. Kerr was widely criticised by Labor supporters for his actions, resigned early as governor-general, and lived much of his remaining life abroad. \\n{{Gough Whitlam sidebar}}\\n\\n== Background ==\\n=== Constitutional ===\\n{{Further|Constitution of Australia}}\\n[[File:John Kerr 1965.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]]]]\\n[[File:Gough Whitlam headshot.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]]]]\\n[[File:Fraser Malcolm BANNER.jpg|thumb|180px|[[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Opposition Leader]] [[Malcolm Fraser]]]]\\n\\nAs established by the Constitution of Australia, the [[Parliament of Australia]] is composed of two houses, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], together with the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarch]]. The monarch is represented through the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]], who has the [[executive power]] granted in the Constitution,{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=1}} as well as rarely exercised [[reserve powers]].{{sfn|McMinn|1979|p=155}} The reserve powers are those exercised by the governor-general without requiring advice, which is usually signified by the phrase \\\"Governor-General in Council\\\".<ref>Commonwealth of Australia Constitution s. 62</ref> Under The Australian Constitution the governor-general acts \\\"with the advice of the Federal Executive Council\\\" in the appointment of government ministers, although ministers serve at his pleasure, and the Executive Council is appointed by the governor-general alone.<ref>Commonwealth of Australia Constitution s. 63, s.64</ref> The governor-general is ordinarily bound by convention to act only upon the advice of the government and the [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], but can act independently and against advice in exercising the reserve powers.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=77}} The governor-general can be removed by the King on the advice of the Australian prime minister. As Liberal Party leader Malcolm Fraser, who played a large part in the crisis, put it, \\\"The Queen has tenure, and she couldn't be sacked. But a Governor-General holds office at pleasure, and if he ceases to please then he can be removed by a Prime Minister\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=135}}\\n\\nAs in most [[Westminster system]] parliaments, Australia's government is ordinarily formed by the party enjoying the [[Confidence and supply#Confidence|confidence]] of the lower House of Parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia's Parliament also has a powerful upper house, the Senate, which must pass any legislation initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state's population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=16\\u201317}} The Constitution forbids the Senate from originating or amending a [[money bill]], but places no limitation on the Senate's ability to defeat one. In 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, stated of a budget bill, \\\"Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and destroy the Government which has sponsored it\\\".{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=132}}\\n\\nThe federal Senate had never blocked supply before 1975, even when it had been controlled by the opposition. In 1947, in response to the federal [[Chifley government]]'s [[Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth|attempt to nationalise the banks]], the coalition-controlled upper house of the [[Parliament of Victoria]] blocked the state budget in order to force a premature election. Labor Premier [[John Cain (34th Premier of Victoria)|John Cain]] called a [[John Cain (34th Premier of Victoria)#Second Cain government|snap election]] and was defeated.<ref>{{cite AuDB | first = Robert | last = Murray | first2 = Kate | last2 = White | title = Cain, John (1882\\u20131957) | volume = 13 | year = 1993 | id2 = cain-john-9661}}</ref>{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=156\\u2013158}}\\n\\nPrior to the 1975 crisis, the governor-general's power to dismiss a prime minister against the incumbent's will under Section 64 of the Constitution had never been exercised. However, in 1904 Labour Prime Minister [[Chris Watson]] advised an early election, but Governor-General Lord Northcote refused, triggering Watson's resignation and the appointment of Opposition Leader [[George Reid]] as prime minister.<ref name=\\\"apmio1\\\">{{cite web\\n | title =Chris Watson, In office\\n | publisher =[[National Archives of Australia]]\\n | work =Australia's Prime Ministers\\n | url =http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/watson/in-office.aspx\\n | access-date =10 February 2010\\n| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160218184033/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/watson/in-office.aspx\\n | archive-date =18 February 2016\\n| url-status =dead\\n }}</ref> Twice since Federation, conflicts between [[Premiers of the Australian states|state premiers]] and [[Governors of the Australian states|state governors]], who perform analogous functions to the prime minister and governor-general respectively at the state level, had resulted in the departure of one or the other. In 1916, New South Wales Premier [[William Holman]] was expelled from the [[Australian Labor Party]] for supporting conscription. He managed to hold on to power with the aid of opposition parties and consulted the Governor, [[Sir Gerald Strickland]], proposing to pass legislation to extend the term of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|lower house of the state legislature]] by a year. When Strickland objected, stating that such a course was unfair to Labor, Holman had him replaced.{{sfn|McMinn|1979|pp=161\\u2013162}} In 1932 the New South Wales Labor premier, [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], refused to pay money owed to the Federal government, which froze the state's bank accounts, causing Lang to order that payments to the state government be only in cash. The governor, [[Sir Philip Game]], wrote to Lang, warning him that ministers were breaking the law, and that if they continued, he would have to obtain ministers who could carry on government within legal bounds. Lang replied that he would not resign, and [[Lang Dismissal Crisis|Game dismissed his government]] and commissioned the leader of the Opposition, [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Bertram Stevens]], to form a caretaker government pending a new election, in which Labor was defeated.{{sfn|McMinn|1979|pp=162\\u2013163}}\\n\\nAmong the powers granted to the governor-general is the power to dissolve both houses of Parliament under Section 57 of the Constitution in the event that the House of Representatives twice passes a bill at least three months apart and the Senate refuses to pass it. In both instances where those circumstances arose prior to the Whitlam government, in 1914 and 1951, the governor-general dissolved Parliament for a \\\"[[double dissolution]]\\\" election on the advice of the prime minister.{{sfn|McMinn|1979|p=154}}\\n\\n=== Political ===\\nGough Whitlam's Labor government was [[1972 Australian federal election|elected in 1972]] after 23 years of rule by a [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] formed by the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|Country]] parties. The ALP Government enjoyed a nine-seat majority in the House of Representatives,{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=39}} but did not control the Senate,{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=45}} which had been elected in [[1967 Australian Senate election|1967]] and [[1970 Australian Senate election|1970]] (as Senate elections were then out of synchronisation with House of Representatives elections). In accordance with pre-election promises, it instituted a large number of policy changes, and offered much legislation. The Opposition, which still controlled the Senate, allowed some Government bills to pass the Senate, and blocked others.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=36\\u201337}}\\n\\nIn April 1974, faced with attempts by the Opposition under [[Billy Snedden]] to block supply (appropriation bills) in the Senate, Whitlam obtained the concurrence of the governor-general, Sir [[Paul Hasluck]], to a double dissolution.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=107}} Labor was returned at the [[1974 Australian federal election|election on 18 May]] with a reduced House majority of five seats. The Coalition and Labor each had 29 Senate seats, with the balance of power held by two independents.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=108}} Snedden later told author [[Graham Freudenberg]] when being interviewed for the book ''A Certain Grandeur \\u2013 Gough Whitlam in Politics'': \\\"The pressure [to block supply] was on me from [[Doug Anthony|Anthony]]. We thought you had a chance of getting control of the Senate at the half-Senate election or at least enough to get a redistribution through. With a [[Gerrymandering|gerrymander]], you'd be in forever.\\\"{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=292}}<!-- cited from 1977 edn, Penguin 1987; is correct for 2009 edn? -->\\n\\nHasluck had been governor-general since 1969, and his term was shortly due to expire. Whitlam wanted him to remain a further two years, but Hasluck declined, citing the refusal of his wife, [[Alexandra Hasluck|Alexandra]], to remain at [[Government House, Canberra|Yarralumla]] longer than the originally agreed five years.<ref name=\\\"Wurth 2010\\\" /> Whitlam offered the post to businessman [[Ken Myer]], who turned it down. Whitlam then offered the position to his treasurer, [[Frank Crean]], and his own deputy, [[Lance Barnard]], neither of whom was keen to move on from parliament.<ref>Jenny Hocking Gough Whitlam: His Time. Melbourne University Publishing 2012. {{ISBN|9780522857931}} p.132</ref> Finally, Whitlam turned to his fifth choice, [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], the chief justice of New South Wales. Kerr was reluctant to give up the chief justiceship, in which he intended to remain another ten years, for the governor-general's post, which traditionally lasted five years. At Kerr's request, Whitlam informally agreed that if both men were still in office in five years, Kerr would be reappointed. Whitlam also secured legislation to address Kerr's financial concerns about the position, including authorising a pension for the governor-general or his widow. The leader of the Opposition, [[Billy Snedden]], was enthusiastic about the appointment and also agreed to reappoint Kerr in five years, were he prime minister at the time. Kerr then agreed to take the post, was duly appointed by Queen [[Elizabeth&nbsp;II]], and was sworn in on 11 July 1974.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=16\\u201319}}\\n\\nSix of the bills that had been the subject of the double dissolution were introduced in Parliament a third time and, as expected, were again rejected by the Senate. Section 57 of the Constitution provides that, after a double dissolution election, if bills that had been rejected twice by the Senate in the previous parliament were again passed by the House and again rejected by the Senate, they could then be put to a [[Joint meetings of the Australian Parliament|joint sitting]] of both houses. On 30 July, Whitlam gained Kerr's agreement for a joint sitting, which was set for 6\\u20137 August 1974. [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|The joint sitting]], the only one in Australia's history under Section 57, passed all six bills, including the enabling legislation for [[Medibank]].{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=307}}\\n\\n=== Controversy and vacancies ===\\nIn December 1974, Whitlam was anxious to find new sources of money to finance his development plans. After a meeting at the prime minister's residence, [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]], Whitlam and three of his ministers ([[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Jim Cairns]], [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] Senator [[Lionel Murphy]], and Minister for Minerals and Energy [[Rex Connor]]) signed a letter of authority for Connor to borrow up to US$4&nbsp;billion. This letter was described by author and journalist [[Alan Reid (journalist)|Alan Reid]] as the \\\"death warrant of the Whitlam ALP government\\\".{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=1}}\\n\\nConnor and other ministers had made contact with a hitherto obscure Pakistani financier, Tirath Khemlani, as early as November 1974. Khemlani was said to have contacts in the newly enriched Arab oil nations.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=160\\u2013161}} None of the efforts to secure a loan, whether through Khemlani or by other routes, bore fruit, but, as information about the \\\"[[Loans Affair]]\\\" trickled out, the government lost support.{{sfn|Brown|2002|pp=128\\u2013129}}\\n\\nIn February 1975, Whitlam decided to appoint Senator Murphy a justice of the [[High Court of Australia]], even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for election if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win three of the five New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=206}} Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill [[Casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament|casual vacancies]] were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, [[Tom Lewis (Australian politician)|Tom Lewis]], a member of the Liberal Party, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect [[Cleaver Bunton]], former mayor of [[Albury]] and an independent.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=206\\u2013208}}\\n\\nBy March 1975, many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was doing an inadequate job as Leader of the Opposition and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=315}} Malcolm Fraser [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 1975|challenged Snedden for the leadership]] on 21 March, and defeated him by 37 votes to 27.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=317}} At a press conference after winning the leadership, Fraser stated:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nThe question of supply\\u2014let me deal with it this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene&nbsp;... Having said that&nbsp;... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd want to find a situation in which Mr Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=251}}\\n}}\\n\\nWhitlam's original deputy prime minister, [[Lance Barnard]], had been challenged and defeated for his post by Cairns in June 1974 shortly after the [[1974 Australian federal election|May 1974 election]]. Whitlam then offered Barnard a diplomatic post; in early 1975 Barnard agreed to this. If the appointment went through, Barnard's resignation from the House of Representatives would trigger [[1975 Bass by-election|a by-election]] in his Tasmanian electorate of [[Division of Bass|Bass]]. ALP officials felt that, given the party's weakened state, Barnard should remain in Parliament and be given no preferment if he resigned; party president and future Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] described the decision to appoint Barnard as \\\"an act of lunacy\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=193}} Barnard had been losing support over the last several elections, and the Liberals needed only a swing of 4% to take Bass off Labor. The Liberals had a candidate, [[Kevin Newman (politician)|Kevin Newman]], who had been nursing the electorate; Labor had no candidate selected and a bitter preselection in the offing.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=193\\u2013195}} Barnard resigned and was appointed the ambassador to Sweden. The election on 28 June proved a disaster for Labor, with Newman winning the seat on a swing of over 17%.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=106}}\\n\\nThe next week, Whitlam fired Cairns for misleading Parliament regarding the Loans Affair amid innuendo about his relationship with his Principal Private Secretary, [[Junie Morosi]]. He was replaced as deputy by [[Frank Crean]].{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|p=345}} At the time of Cairns' dismissal, one Senate seat was vacant, following the death on 30 June of Queensland ALP Senator [[Bertie Milliner]]. The state Labor party nominated [[Mal Colston]], who was the highest unelected candidate on the party's Queensland list in 1974. This resulted in deadlock in Brisbane; the unicameral Queensland legislature twice voted against Colston, and the party refused to submit any alternative candidates.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=107\\u2013109}} Queensland Country Party Premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] had evidence that Colston, a schoolteacher by trade, had set a school on fire during a labour dispute, though the police had refused to prosecute.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=457}} After the legislature voted Colston down a second time, Bjelke-Petersen instructed his majority in the legislature to elect a low-level union official, [[Albert Field]], who had contacted his office and expressed a willingness to serve. In interviews, Field made it clear he would not support Whitlam. Field was expelled from the ALP for standing against Colston, and Labor senators boycotted his swearing-in.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=107\\u2013109}} Whitlam argued that because of the vacancies being filled as they were, the Senate was \\\"corrupted\\\" and \\\"tainted\\\", with the Opposition enjoying a majority they did not win at the ballot box.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=109}} When Labor learned that Field had not given the required three weeks' notice to the [[Department of Education and Training (Queensland)|Queensland Department of Education]], it challenged his appointment in the High Court, arguing that he was still technically a public servant\\u2013and thus ineligible to serve in the Senate. With Field on leave throughout the remainder of the crisis, the Coalition refused to provide a \\\"[[pair (parliamentary convention)|pair]]\\\" to account for his absence, giving it an effective majority of 30\\u201329 in the Senate.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=375}} Whitlam remarked that if Milliner had not died or had he been replaced by a [pro Whitlam] senator, the crisis would not have happened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/historical-documents/volume-27/Pages/507-despatch-james-to-callaghan|title = 507 Despatch, James to Callaghan}}</ref>\\n\\n== Deadlock ==\\n=== Deferral of supply ===\\n[[File:Senate, Old Parliament House, Canberra.JPG|right|thumb|The Senate chamber at the Old Parliament House]]\\nOn 10 October, the High Court ruled that the act passed at the joint sitting that gave the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] two senators each was valid. A half-Senate election needed to be held by June 1976; most senators-elect would take their seats on 1 July, but the territorial senators and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats would take their places at once.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=343\\u2013344}} The ruling meant that it was possible for the ALP to gain a temporary majority in the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976. To do so, the ALP would have to win Field's and Bunton's seats, and one seat in each territory, and have the second ACT seat fall to either a Labor candidate or an independent, former Liberal Prime Minister [[John Gorton]], now estranged from his party. If this happened, Labor would have an effective 33\\u201331 margin, would be able to pass supply if that was still an issue, and also could pass [[one vote, one value|electoral redistribution laws]] (which had been passed by the House, though twice defeated by the Senate) that would give it an advantage at the next election.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=354\\u2013356}}\\n\\nThe journalist and author [[Alan Reid (journalist)|Alan Reid]] described the position of the Government and Opposition as the crisis became acute in mid-October:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nWhile it was possibly an overstatement to describe the 1975 position as a choice between evils, neither of the two major political groupings reached the 15 October 1975 crunch position with completely clean hands. Fraser and the Liberal-CP senators&nbsp;... lacked the numbers to defer the Budget until the arrival in the Senate of Albert Patrick Field, whose arrival was not due to any decision by the Australian voters but to a decision by one of the rulers, the Whitlam-hating Bjelke-Petersen&nbsp;... Whitlam for his part had decided even before the Budget was deferred to embark upon the bold, Cromwellian project of changing the Australian Constitution, not through the vote of the mass electorate&nbsp;... but through prodigious personal exertions backed by the support of his parliamentary followers.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=364}}\\n}}\\n\\nIn the wake of the High Court ruling, and with the appropriation bills due to be considered by the Senate on 16 October, Fraser was undecided whether to block supply. His biographer, Philip Ayres, contends that, had there been no further government scandals, he would not have done so. Khemlani, however, had alleged \\u2013 contrary to government statements \\u2013 that Connor had never revoked his authority to obtain loans and had been in regular contact with him even into mid-1975. On 13 October, the [[The Herald (Melbourne)|Melbourne ''Herald'']] printed documents in support of Khemlani's allegations, and on the following day, Connor resigned.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=273\\u2013274}} Fraser determined to block supply, convened a [[shadow cabinet]] meeting and received the unanimous support of the Coalition frontbench.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=274\\u2013275}} At a press conference, Fraser cited the poor state of the economy and the continuing scandals as reasons for his decision. Without the passage of fresh appropriations, supply would be exhausted on 30 November.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=275\\u2013276}}\\n\\nOn 15 October the Governor of Queensland, Sir [[Colin Hannah]], gave a speech denigrating the Whitlam government, in violation of the convention that state governors remain neutral. Hannah held a [[dormant commission]] as [[Administrator (Australia)|Administrator of the Commonwealth]] to act as Governor-General in the event of Kerr's death, resignation, or absence from Australia. Whitlam immediately contacted [[Buckingham Palace]] to arrange for Hannah's dormant commission to be revoked, a process which took ten days to complete.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=370}} Although Whitlam later alleged that he never contemplated dismissing Kerr during the crisis, on 16 October, while speaking with Kerr and visiting Malaysian Prime Minister [[Abdul Razak Hussein|Tun Abdul Razak]], he told Kerr that if the crisis continued, \\\"It could be a question of whether I get to the Queen first for your recall, or whether you get in first with my dismissal\\\". Kerr saw the statement as a threat; Whitlam later stated the comment was \\\"flippant\\\" and designed to turn the conversation to another subject.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=131\\u2013132}}\\n\\nOn 16 and 17 October, the Senate, with the unanimous support of the Coalition majority, deferred the appropriation bills.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=275\\u2013276}} The Coalition took the position that Kerr could dismiss Whitlam if the Government could not secure supply. Whitlam's former solicitor-general [[Bob Ellicott]], now a Liberal member of the House, issued a legal opinion on 16 October stating that the Governor-General had the power to dismiss Whitlam, and should do so forthwith if Whitlam could not state how he would obtain supply. Ellicott indicated that Whitlam was treating Kerr as if he had no discretion but to follow prime ministerial advice, when in fact the Governor-General could and should dismiss a ministry unable to secure supply. Ellicott stated that Kerr\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nshould ask the Prime Minister if the Government is prepared to advise him to dissolve the House of Representatives and the Senate or the House of Representatives alone as a means of assuring that the disagreement between the two Houses is resolved. If the Prime Minister refuses to do either, it is then open to the Governor-General to dismiss his present Ministers and seek others who are prepared to give him the only proper advice open. This he should proceed to do.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=145\\u2013146}}\\n}}\\n\\n=== Consultations and negotiations ===\\nKerr's major confidante and secret adviser regarding the dismissal was a member of the High Court and friend of Kerr, Sir [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Anthony Mason]] whose role was not revealed until 2012 when Whitlam's biographer [[Jenny Hocking]] detailed Kerr's archival record of their extensive consultations.<ref>Jenny Hocking Gough Whitlam: His Time.

Whitlam advised Kerr not to do so, noting that no Governor-General had consulted with a Chief Justice under similar circumstances since 1914, when Australia was at a much earlier stage of her constitutional development.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=151}} Whitlam also noted that in all of the recent unsuccessful High Court challenges to Whitlam government legislation, Barwick had been in the minority in finding against the government.<ref>Jenny Hocking Gough Whitlam: His Time. Melbourne University Publishing. 2012. p.258</ref> On 21 October, Kerr phoned Whitlam regarding the Ellicott opinion, and asked, \\\"It's all bullshit, isn't it?\\\". Whitlam agreed with Kerr's view. Kerr then requested that the Government provide him with a written legal opinion rebutting Ellicott's views.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=386}} Kerr would receive no written advice from the Government until 6 November.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=152}} Journalist and author [[Paul Kelly (journalist)|Paul Kelly]], who wrote two books on the crisis, paints this delay as a major mistake by Whitlam, given Kerr's judicial background.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=152}} Kerr also asked on 21 October for Whitlam's permission to interview Fraser, which the Prime Minister readily granted, and the two men met that night. Fraser told Kerr that the Opposition were determined to block supply. Fraser indicated that the Opposition's decision to defer the appropriation bills, rather than defeating them, was a tactical decision, since then the bills would remain in the control of the Senate and could be passed at any time. He stated that the Coalition agreed with the Ellicott opinion, and proposed to continue deferring supply while it awaited events.{{sfn|Kerr|1978|pp=277\\u2013278}} The media were not told of the substance of the conversation, and instead reported that Kerr had reprimanded Fraser for blocking supply, causing the Governor-General's office to issue a denial.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=381\\u2013382}}\\n\\nThroughout the crisis, Kerr did not tell Whitlam of his increasing concerns, nor did he suggest that he might dismiss Whitlam. He believed nothing he said would influence Whitlam, and feared that, if Whitlam perceived him as a possible opponent, the Prime Minister would procure his dismissal from the Queen. Accordingly, though Kerr dealt with Whitlam in an affable manner, he did not confide his thinking to the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=167}} Labor Senator [[Tony Mulvihill]] later related that \\\"Whitlam would come back to each caucus meeting and say, 'I saw His Excellency&nbsp;... No worry. He's got to do it his way.'&nbsp;... at no time did he hint that the Governor-General was frowning.\\\"{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|p=347}}\\n\\nThere was intense public interest and concern at the stalemate, and Fraser and his Liberals acted to shore up support. Liberal frontbenchers worked to build unity for the tactic in state organisations. The former longtime [[Premier of South Australia]] Sir [[Thomas Playford IV|Thomas Playford]] was speaking out against the blocking of supply, causing South Australia Senator [[Don Jessop]] to waver in his support for the tactic. Fraser was able to co-ordinate a wave of communications from party members which served to neutralise both men. Fraser sought the backing of the retired longtime Liberal Prime Minister, Sir [[Robert Menzies]], and went to see Menzies in person, taking with him a 1947 statement by Menzies supporting the blocking of supply in the [[Victorian Legislative Council|upper house]] of the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Parliament]]. He did not have to use the paper; Menzies stated that he found the tactic distasteful, but in this case necessary. The former prime minister issued a statement in support of Fraser's tactics.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=156\\u2013158}}\\n\\nKerr invited Whitlam and [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Labour]] Senator [[Jim McClelland]] to lunch on 30 October, immediately preceding an [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Executive Council]] meeting. At that meal, Kerr proposed a possible compromise. If the Opposition were to allow supply to pass, Whitlam would not advise a half-Senate election until May or June 1976, and the Senate would not convene until 1 July, thus obviating the threat of a possible temporary Labor majority. Whitlam, who was determined to destroy both Fraser's leadership and the Senate's right to block supply, refused any compromise.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=382\\u2013383}}\\n\\n=== Decision ===\\n{{blockquote|text=Because of the federal nature of our Constitution and because of its provisions the Senate undoubtedly has constitutional power to refuse or defer supply to the Government.

If he refuses to do this I have the authority and indeed the duty under the Constitution to withdraw his Commission as Prime Minister. The position in Australia is quite different from a position in the United Kingdom. Here the confidence of both Houses on supply is necessary to ensure its provision. In the United Kingdom the confidence of the House of Commons alone is necessary.

The resulting communiqu\\u00e9 urged the Coalition senators to continue deferring supply. It also threatened, should Kerr grant Whitlam a half-Senate election, that the Coalition state premiers would advise their governors not to issue writs, thus blocking the election from taking place in the four states with non-Labor premiers.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=184\\u2013185}} After the meeting, Fraser proposed a compromise: that the Opposition would concede supply if Whitlam agreed to hold a House of Representatives election at the same time as the half-Senate election.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=185\\u2013186}} Whitlam rejected the idea.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|pp=388\\u2013389}}\\n\\nOn 22 October, Whitlam had asked the [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], [[Kep Enderby]], to have a paper drafted rebutting the Ellicott opinion for presentation to Kerr. Enderby delegated this task to the Solicitor-General, [[Maurice Byers]], and other officials. On 6 November, Enderby was to see Kerr to give him a legal opinion regarding the Government's alternative plans in case supply ran out. Vouchers were to be issued to Commonwealth employees and contractors instead of cheques, to be redeemed from banks after the crisis ended\\u2014transactions which were to be rejected by major banks as \\\"tainted with illegality\\\".{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=400}} Enderby decided to present Kerr with the rebuttal to Ellicott. When Enderby reviewed the document, he found that, while it argued for the Government's position, it recognised both that the Senate had the constitutional right to block supply, and that the reserve powers were still extant\\u2014matters with which Enderby did not agree. He presented Kerr with the rebuttal, but crossed out Byers' signature on it and told Kerr of his disagreement. Enderby told Kerr that the Byers rebuttal was \\\"background\\\" for formal written advice, to be presented by Whitlam.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=287}} Later that day, Kerr met with Fraser again. The Opposition leader told him that if Kerr did not dismiss Whitlam, the Opposition planned to criticise him in Parliament for failing to carry out his duty.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=290}}\\n\\nKerr concluded on 6 November that neither Government nor Opposition would yield and had received advice that day from Treasurer Bill Hayden that supply would run out on 27 November.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=389}} The Governor-General decided that, as Whitlam could not secure supply, and would not resign or advise an election for the House of Representatives, he would have to sack him. As Kerr feared that Whitlam might advise the Queen to dismiss him, he considered it important that Whitlam be given no hint of the impending action. Kerr later stated that were Whitlam to seek his dismissal, it would involve the Queen in politics.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=215\\u2013217}} Seeking confirmation of his decision, he contacted Chief Justice Barwick, met with him and asked for his views of a dismissal of Whitlam. Barwick furnished him with written advice containing his view that a governor-general could and should dismiss a prime minister who was unable to obtain supply.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=222\\u2013226}} Barwick specified that the prime minister should also not have refused either to resign or to advise a general election, with which Kerr agreed.\\n\\nOn 9 November, Fraser contacted Whitlam and invited him to negotiations with the Coalition aimed at settling the dispute. Whitlam agreed, and a meeting was set for 9&nbsp;am on Tuesday 11 November, at Parliament House. That Tuesday was also the deadline for an election to be called if it were to be held before Christmas.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=392}} Both Government and Opposition leaders were in Melbourne on the night of 10 November for the Lord Mayor's banquet. To ensure the Opposition leaders could reach Canberra in time for the meeting, Whitlam brought them back in his VIP aircraft, which arrived in Canberra at midnight.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=291}}\\n\\n== Dismissal ==\\n=== Meeting at Yarralumla ===\\n[[File:Government House, Canberra.jpg|thumb|250px|Yarralumla, the official residence of the Governor-General]]\\n\\nAt 9&nbsp;a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, together with deputy prime minister [[Frank Crean]] and [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]] [[Fred Daly (politician)|Fred Daly]], met with Fraser and Country Party leader [[Doug Anthony]]. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders that he would be advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13 December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=245\\u2013247}} and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with [[Remembrance Day]] commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00&nbsp;p.m.,{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=247\\u2013248}} though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=255}} Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=407}}\\n\\nAfter hearing from Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr asked him whether he, if commissioned prime minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and investigations of the Whitlam government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those questions were asked later in the day before Kerr commissioned Fraser as prime minister.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=249}} According to Kerr, Fraser was supposed to come to Yarralumla at 1.00&nbsp;pm.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=255}}\\n\\nWhitlam was delayed in leaving Parliament House, while Fraser left slightly early, with the result that Fraser arrived at Yarralumla first. He was taken into an anteroom, and his car was moved. Whitlam maintained that the purpose in moving Fraser's car was to ensure that the Prime Minister was not tipped off by seeing it, stating, \\\"Had I known Mr. Fraser was already there, I would not have set foot in Yarralumla\\\".{{sfn|Whitlam|1979|p=108}} Kelly doubted Whitlam would have recognised Fraser's car, which was an ordinary [[Ford LTD (Australia)|Ford LTD]] from the car pool.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=256}} According to Fraser biographer Philip Ayres, \\\"A white car pulled up at the front would signify nothing in particular\\u2014it would simply be in the way\\\".{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=295}}\\n\\nWhitlam arrived just before 1:00&nbsp;p.m. and was taken to Kerr's office by an aide. He brought with him the formal letter advising a half-Senate election, and after the two men were seated, attempted to give it to Kerr. According to Kerr, he interrupted Whitlam and asked if, as a result of the failure to find a compromise between party leaders, he intended to govern without parliamentary supply, to which the Prime Minister answered, \\\"Yes\\\". In their accounts of their meeting, both men agree that Kerr then told Whitlam about the decision to withdraw his commission as prime minister under Section&nbsp;64 of the Constitution.<ref>Section 64 of the Constitution empowers the Governor-General to appoint ministers of state, who \\\"shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General\\\".</ref> Kerr later wrote that at this point Whitlam got to his feet, looked at the office's phones, and stated, \\\"I must get in touch with the Palace at once\\\". According to Kerr, this indicated that Whitlam would not try to negotiate with him about a general election but contact the Queen for his recall, which gave him the final reason to carry out the dismissal; he answered that it was too late to get in touch with the Palace because Whitlam was not prime minister any more.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=256\\u2013257}}{{sfn|Kerr|1978|p=358}} Whitlam, however, later disputed that such words were spoken, and stated that he asked Kerr whether he had consulted the Palace, to which Kerr replied that he did not need to, and that he had the advice of Barwick. Both accounts agree that Kerr then handed Whitlam a letter of dismissal and statement of reasons, stating that they would both have to live with this, to which Whitlam replied, \\\"''You'' certainly will\\\". The dismissal concluded with Kerr wishing Whitlam luck in the election, and offering his hand, which the former prime minister took.{{sfn|Kerr|1978|p=358-359}}{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=257\\u2013259}}<ref>The dismissal letter, Kerr's statement of reasons and Barwick's advice are reproduced in {{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George|last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory |year=2014 |edition=6 |publisher=Federation Press |location=Leichhardt, NSW }} pp.&nbsp;361\\u2013365.

Fraser later stated that his overwhelming sensation at the news was relief.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=295}} Fraser left to return to Parliament House, where he conferred with Coalition leaders, while Kerr joined the luncheon party that had been waiting for him, apologising to his guests and offering the excuse that he had been busy dismissing the Government.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=263}}\\n\\n=== Parliamentary strategy ===\\nWhitlam returned to The Lodge, where he had lunch. When his aides arrived, he informed them of his sacking. Whitlam drafted a resolution for the House, expressing confidence in his Government. No ALP Senate leaders were at The Lodge, nor did Whitlam and his party contact any when they drove back to Parliament House, confining their strategy to the House of Representatives.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=414\\u2013415}}\\n\\nPrior to Whitlam's dismissal, the Labor leadership decided to introduce a motion that the Senate pass the appropriation bills. With ALP senators unaware of Whitlam's sacking, that plan went ahead. Senator [[Doug McClelland]], manager of the ALP Government's business in the Senate, informed Coalition Senate leader [[Reg Withers]] of Labor's intent at about 1.30&nbsp;pm. Withers then attended a leadership meeting where he learned of Fraser's appointment and assured the new prime minister he could secure supply. When the Senate convened, the ALP Senate leader, [[Ken Wriedt]], made the motion to pass the appropriation bills. As Wriedt did so, he was told that the government had been sacked, which he initially refused to believe. Authoritative word did not reach Wriedt until 2.15&nbsp;pm, by which time it was too late to withdraw the motion and instead obstruct his party's appropriation bill to hinder Fraser. At 2.24&nbsp;pm, Labor's appropriation bills passed the Senate, fulfilling Fraser's first promise of providing supply.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=267\\u2013269}}\\n\\nIn the House, desultory debate on Fraser's censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34&nbsp;pm, when Fraser rose and announced that he had been commissioned as prime minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of no confidence in him, and asked the Speaker, [[Gordon Scholes]], to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor-General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45&nbsp;pm.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=271}}\\n\\n=== Dissolution ===\\n[[File:Whitlam dismissal 19751111 Sydney.jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in [[George Street, Sydney]], outside the [[Sydney Town Hall]], about 6.45&nbsp;pm 11 November 1975 following news of the dismissal.]]\\n\\nAfter the appropriation bills were approved by both Houses, they were sent over to Yarralumla where Kerr gave them [[Royal Assent]]. With supply assured, Kerr then received Fraser, who advised him that 21&nbsp;bills (including the electoral redistribution bills) which had been introduced since the last election fulfilled the double dissolution provisions of Section&nbsp;57. Fraser asked that both Houses be dissolved for an election on 13 December. Kerr signed the proclamation dissolving Parliament, and sent his [[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia|Official Secretary]], [[David Smith (public servant)|David Smith]], to proclaim the dissolution from the front steps of Parliament House.{{sfn|Kerr|1978|pp=369\\u2013373}}\\n\\nAt 4.45, Kerr received Scholes, and informed him of the dissolution. Kerr wrote that \\\"nothing else of relevance\\\" took place between the two men,{{sfn|Kerr|1978|p=374}} but Scholes's account is that he accused Kerr of bad faith for making an appointment to receive the Speaker, and then not waiting to hear from him before dissolving Parliament.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=273}} Whitlam later stated that it would have been wiser for Scholes to take the appropriation bills with him, rather than having them sent ahead.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=271}} Kerr's action was based on the advice he had received from two High Court judges (Mason and Chief Justice Barwick) and the Crown Law Officers (Byers and Clarence Harders, the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department).<ref name=\\\"tragedy\\\" />{{sfn|Kerr|1978|pp=368\\u2013371}}<ref>See also Barwick's letter to Kerr 10 November 1975 and Kerr's letter to Sir Martin Charteris 11 November 1975.

On 12&nbsp;November, Scholes wrote to the Queen, asking her to restore Whitlam as prime minister. The reply from her [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|private secretary]], [[Martin Charteris, Baron Charteris of Amisfield|Sir Martin Charteris]], dated 17 November 1975, stated:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nAs we understand the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown in the hands of the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper for her to intervene in person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.{{sfn|Kerr|1978|pp=374\\u2013375}}\\n}}\\n\\nOn 12 November 1975, the [[First Fraser Ministry]] was sworn in by Kerr. By some accounts, Kerr sought reassurance at that meeting that the Coalition senators would not have given in before supply ran out, \\\"The Senate would never have caved in, would it?\\\" According to those accounts, Senator [[Margaret Guilfoyle]] laughed and said to a colleague, \\\"That's all he knows\\\".{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=412}} Guilfoyle later stated that, if she did make such a remark, it was not meant to imply that the Coalition senators would have broken.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=240}} However, Kelly lists four Coalition senators who stated, in subsequent years, that they would have crossed the floor and voted for the appropriation bills.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=240}}\\n\\nLabor believed it had a chance of winning the election, and that the dismissal would be an electoral asset for them.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=300}} However, some Labor strategists believed the party was heading for a disaster, with few economic accomplishments to point to and an electorate whose emotions would have cooled before polling day.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=302}} Nonetheless, Whitlam, who began campaigning almost immediately after the dismissal, was met with huge crowds wherever he went; 30,000&nbsp;people overspilled the [[The Domain, Sydney|Sydney Domain]] for the official campaign launch on 24 November.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=302}} That evening, Whitlam made a major speech at [[Festival Hall (Melbourne)|Festival Hall]] in Melbourne before 7,500&nbsp;people and a national TV audience, calling 11 November \\\"Fraser's day of shame\\u2014a day that will live in infamy\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=303}}\\n\\nPolls were released at the end of the first week of campaigning, and showed a nine-point swing against Labor. Whitlam's campaign did not believe it at first, but additional polling made it clear that the electorate was turning against the ALP. The Coalition attacked Labor for the economic conditions, and released television commercials \\\"The Three Dark Years\\\" showing images from the Whitlam government scandals. The ALP campaign, which had concentrated on the issue of Whitlam's dismissal, did not begin to address the economy until its final days. By that time Fraser, confident of victory, was content to sit back, avoid specifics and make no mistakes.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=303\\u2013307}} There was little violence in the campaign, but three letter bombs were placed in the post; one wounded two people in Bjelke-Petersen's office, while the other two, addressed to Kerr and Fraser, were intercepted and defused.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=300}}\\n\\nDuring the campaign, the Kerrs purchased a Sydney apartment, as Sir John was prepared to resign in the event that the ALP triumphed.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=281}} In the [[1975 Australian federal election|13 December election]], the Coalition won a record victory, with 91&nbsp;seats in the House of Representatives to the ALP's 36 and a 35\\u201327 majority in the expanded Senate.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=301}}\\n\\n=== Reactions ===\\nThe dismissal is considered the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australia's history.<ref name=\\\"soru\\\" /> In 1977, the Fraser government proposed four constitutional amendments via [[1977 Australian referendum|referendum]], three of which passed\\u2014the last time that the Australian Constitution has been amended. [[Australian referendum, 1977 (Senate Casual Vacancies)|One of the amendments]] requires that a senator appointed to fill a casual vacancy be from the same party as the former senator.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=132}} The Senate retains the power to block supply; the governor-general retains the power to dismiss ministers (including the prime minister).{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=132}} However, these powers have not since been used to force a government from office.\\n\\nIn the wake of the dismissal, the ALP turned its anger on Kerr. Demonstrations marked his appearances, while the remaining ALP parliamentarians boycotted his opening of the new parliament. Whitlam, now Leader of the Opposition, refused all invitations to events at [[Government House, Canberra|Yarralumla]], which the Kerrs continued to extend until his refusal of an invitation during the Queen's 1977 visit caused them to feel that no further efforts need be made.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=281\\u2013282}} Whitlam never spoke with Kerr again.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=316}} Even ALP parliamentarians who had been friends of Kerr broke off their relationships, feeling Kerr had betrayed the party and had ambushed Whitlam. [[Anne Kerr, Lady Kerr|Lady Kerr]] stated that she and her husband confronted a \\\"new irrational scene swarming with instant enemies\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=282\\u2013283}}\\n\\nWhitlam repeatedly castigated Kerr for his role in the dismissal. When Kerr announced his resignation as governor-general on 14 July 1977, Whitlam commented: \\\"How fitting that the last of the [[Bourbons]] should bow out on [[Bastille Day]]\\\".{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=458}} After Kerr resigned as governor-general, he still sought a government position, reasoning that it had been his intent to remain for ten years as governor-general. However, Fraser's attempt to appoint Kerr as ambassador to [[UNESCO]] (a position later held by Whitlam) provoked such public outcry that the nomination was withdrawn. The Kerrs spent the next several years living in Europe,{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=284}} and when he died in Australia in 1991, his death was not announced until after he was buried.<ref name=\\\"LA Times 1991\\\" /> In 1991, Whitlam stated that no future governor-general was likely to act as Kerr did lest he also became the subject of \\\"contempt and isolation\\\".{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=206}} In 1997 he said that the letter of dismissal \\\"had the shortcomings of being ''[[ex tempore]]'', ''[[ex parte]]'', ''[[ad hoc]]'' and ''[[sub rosa]]''\\\".{{sfn|Whitlam|1997|p=2}} In 2005, Whitlam called Kerr \\\"a contemptible person\\\".<ref name=\\\"soru\\\" /> On the other hand, Country Party leader and deputy prime minister [[Doug Anthony]] said: \\\"I can't forgive Gough for crucifying him\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=282\\u2013283}} Sir Garfield Barwick was not spared Whitlam's invective; the former Prime Minister described him as \\\"evil\\\".{{sfn |Cohen|1996|p=209}} Though denied by both Kerr and Whitlam, unsubstantiated allegations have been made about [[Alleged CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal|CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal]].<ref>{{citation| last = Steketee| first = Mark| title = Carter denied CIA meddling| periodical = The Australian| date = 1 January 2008| url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/cabinet-papers/carter-denied-cia-meddling/story-e6frgd9x-1111115224991 | access-date = 19 May 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000551/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/cabinet-papers/carter-denied-cia-meddling/story-e6frgd9x-1111115224991| archive-date = 10 October 2010| url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\\\"Kelly-no-role\\\" />\\n\\nWhitlam resigned as ALP leader after the party suffered its second successive electoral defeat in [[1977 Australian federal election|1977]].{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|pp=460\\u2013461}} Fraser served over seven years as prime minister, and left the Liberal leadership after the Coalition was defeated in the [[1983 Australian federal election|March 1983 election]].{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=431\\u2013432}} Years later, Whitlam and Fraser put aside their differences; Whitlam wrote in 1997 that Fraser \\\"did not set out to deceive me\\\".{{sfn|Whitlam|1997|p=48}} The two campaigned together in support of [[1999 Australian republic referendum|the 1999 referendum]] that would have made Australia a republic.<ref name=\\\"Marks 1999\\\" /> According to Whitlam speechwriter [[Graham Freudenberg]], \\\"the residual rage over the conduct of the Queen's representative found a constructive outlet in the movement for the [[Australian Republic]]\\\".{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=463}}\\n\\nFreudenberg summed up Kerr's fate after the dismissal:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nThe beneficiaries of the Dismissal scarcely bothered to defend Kerr and in the end abandoned him.

The album is the band\\u2019s most recent to date to feature a runtime of under an hour. Instead of releasing a single or video in advance of the album's release, Metallica embarked on a five-month American tour in support of [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. The European leg was canceled after Burton's death in September 1986, and the band returned home to audition a new bassist.\\n\\n''Master of Puppets'' peaked at number 29 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its music and political lyrics. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential metal albums of all time, and is credited with consolidating the American [[thrash metal]] scene. It was certified [[RIAA certification|six times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2003 for shipping six million copies in the United States, and was later certified six times platinum by [[Music Canada]] and platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).

The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. ''Brisco'' was one of the last television shows to be filmed on the [[Warner Bros.]] Western backlot.

[[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber barons]] control the financial and industrial interests of the West from the boardrooms of San Francisco's Westerfield Club. The famous [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Brisco County, Sr. ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) has apprehended a gang of outlaws and its leader, the notorious John Bly ([[Billy Drago]]). While transporting them to stand trial, County is murdered and the gang escapes. Meanwhile, in a nearby mine, a group of shackled Chinese workers unearths \\\"The Orb\\\", a large golden globe studded with rods. A worker draws one of the rods from out of the Orb, then touches several of his co-workers with it. As each worker is touched with the rod he is imbued with superhuman strength which they use to break the iron chains binding them, thus freeing themselves.<ref name=\\\"pilot_episode\\\">David Simkins (writer) & [[Bryan Spicer]] (director), \\\"Pilot\\\". \\\"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\\\", [[Fox Network|Fox]].

Another bounty hunter, Lord Bowler ([[Julius Carry]]), who is known for his expert tracking skills, also hopes to capture Bly. Bitter over the elder County's fame, Bowler treats Brisco as a rival.

Speaking about the humor of the show, Campbell said, \\\"I would say 30 percent of each episode is being played for laughs. But it's not a winking at the camera, ''[[Airplane!|Airplane]]''-type of humor.

He later said, \\\"The similarities between this show and ''The Wild Wild West'', and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me.

He had no knowledge of Campbell, but approved of the choice for the leading man after watching ''[[Army of Darkness]]''.

They followed Cuse's informal instruction that the tone of the show remain \\\"just under over-the-top\\\": the series would be humorous but not too [[Camp (style)|campy]]. Every member of the staff participated in breaking down and analyzing the stories they conceived. Worth commented, \\\"there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in the room and got translated to paper that worked when you put them on film.

Each episode of ''Brisco'' was filmed in seven days, so the turn-around time for scripts was one week.<ref name=\\\"briscowritersroom\\\"/> McNamara said that he became a \\\"student of TV history\\\" while writing for ''Brisco'', reviewing old episodes of ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' for inspiration on using humor in the Western genre. He said the writing team felt the television audience was ready for a \\\"trans-genre form\\\", because much of the audience grew up with ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', and ''[[The Wild Wild West]]''.<ref name=\\\"mcnamara_interview\\\">{{cite book | last1 = Longworth | first1 = James L. | title = TV creators: conversations with America's top producers of television drama | volume = 2 | publisher = Syracuse University Press | year = 2002 | location = Syracuse, New York | pages = 258\\u2013259 | isbn = 0-8156-0702-4}}</ref> Researchers Lynnette Porter and Barry Porter acknowledge the writer's familiarity with [[Mark Twain]]'s novel ''[[Pudd'nhead Wilson]]''.

Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized \\\"pirate ship on wheels\\\". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the [[production designers]] could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said it was better to \\\"shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it\\\".

The main horse was Copper, chosen by veteran [[Wrangler (profession)|wrangler]] Gordon Spencer because it was calm and gentle. Campbell nicknamed the horse \\\"Leadbelly\\\" due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes. Another horse, Boss, was used for long-range shots, chase scenes, and elaborate stunts, such as leaps through windows. Ace was called in when the crew had to shoot scenes in which the horse reared. Near the end of the season, a horse named Comet was trained, its name chosen so that the horse would get used to hearing it on set.<ref name=\\\"encyclopedia_tv_pets\\\" /> The \\\"true show horse\\\" was Strip, which was adept at doing tricks, such as lip movements, head nods, and hoof stamping. According to Spencer, all those stunts \\\"as well as tying the knots and opening the door and going into rooms and all of that\\\" were done by Strip. For these scenes, Spencer would stand off-camera and use a stick to signal Strip. Campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and filled it with grain to reward Strip after every take.<ref name=\\\"bruceautobiography\\\" /> No other horse had more scenes than Strip and Copper. With white colorings on his nose and legs, Strip's appearance was chosen for Brisco's steed; Copper and the other horses were touched up with \\\"clown white\\\" greasepaint to match Strip's markings.<ref name=\\\"encyclopedia_tv_pets\\\" />\\n\\n[[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] artist Casey Crabtree provided sounds for horse hoof movements, work that was praised by sounds effects industry expert [[David Yewdall]].

One of the prop Orbs was used for stunts and had retractable rods. A second version was manufactured from cast bronze, making it heavy: \\\"You really didn't want to have to handle it,\\\" Campbell said. The rocket car seen in the pilot episode was built by special effects coordinator Kam Cooney and was a working vehicle with an internal combustion engine and throttle controls. Some items used in the show had been repurposed from older productions, and some would later be used in other shows.

At the time, NBC had often used excerpts from film scores as theme music for its sports broadcasts, and had used a portion of Edelman's ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'' score for the [[Breeder's Cup]]. A portfolio Edelman sent NBC included the ''Brisco'' theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics; the theme would be retired after the 2016 games. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the [[1996 World Series]] and [[1997 World Series]]. Edelman said, \\\"It was original, and it seemed to have the right spirit. It's got a very flowing melody, it's triumphant, and it has a certain warmth.

It has been described as the greatest political and [[constitutional crisis]] in Australian history.\\n\\nThe Labor Party under [[Gough Whitlam]] came to power in the [[1972 Australian federal election|election of 1972]], ending 23 consecutive years of [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal-Country Coalition]] government. Labor won a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] of 67 seats to the Coalition's 58 seats, but faced a hostile [[Australian Senate|Senate]]. In May 1974, after the Senate voted to reject six of Labor's non-supply bills, Whitlam advised then-Governor General, Sir [[Paul Hasluck]], to call a [[1974 Australian federal election|double dissolution election]]. The election saw Labor re-elected with its House of Representatives majority reduced from 9 to 5 seats, although it gained seats in the Senate. With the two houses of Parliament still deadlocked, pursuant to section 57 of the [[Australian Constitution]], Whitlam was able to narrowly secure passage of the six \\\"trigger bills\\\" of the earlier double dissolution election in a [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|joint sitting of Parliament]] on 6\\u20137 August 1974, the only such sitting held in Australia's history.\\n\\nWhitlam's tenure in office proved highly turbulent and controversial, and in October 1975, the Opposition under [[Malcolm Fraser]] used its control of the Senate to defer passage of [[appropriation bill]]s needed to finance government expenditure, which had already been passed by the House of Representatives. Fraser and the Opposition stated that they would continue to [[Loss of supply|block supply]] in the Senate unless Whitlam called a fresh election for the House of Representatives, and urged Governor-General [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], who had been appointed governor-general on Whitlam's advice in July 1974, to dismiss Whitlam unless Whitlam acceded to their demand. Whitlam believed that Kerr would not dismiss him as prime minister, and Kerr did nothing to make Whitlam believe that he might be dismissed.\\n\\nOn 11 November 1975, the crisis came to a head as Whitlam went to seek Kerr's approval to call a half-Senate election in an attempt to break the parliamentary deadlock. Kerr did not accept Whitlam's request, and instead dismissed him as prime minister and appointed the leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Fraser, as [[Caretaker government of Australia|caretaker prime minister]] on the understanding that Fraser would immediately call a general election. Acting quickly before all ALP parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his parliamentary allies were able to secure passage of the supply bills through the Senate and advised Kerr to dissolve Parliament for a [[double dissolution]] election. Fraser and his Liberal-Country Coalition were elected with a massive majority in the [[1975 Australian federal election|federal election held the following month]].\\n\\nThe events of the Dismissal led to only minor constitutional change. The Senate retained its power to block supply, and the governor-general the power to dismiss government ministers; however, these powers have not since been used to force a government from office. <!--The following sentence has been discussed: do not remove without consensus-->Despite being denied by both Kerr and Whitlam, allegations have repeatedly been made about [[Alleged CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal|CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal]], but remain unsubstantiated. Kerr was widely criticised by Labor supporters for his actions, resigned early as governor-general, and lived much of his remaining life abroad. \\n{{Gough Whitlam sidebar}}\\n\\n== Background ==\\n=== Constitutional ===\\n{{Further|Constitution of Australia}}\\n[[File:John Kerr 1965.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]]]]\\n[[File:Gough Whitlam headshot.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]]]]\\n[[File:Fraser Malcolm BANNER.jpg|thumb|180px|[[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Opposition Leader]] [[Malcolm Fraser]]]]\\n\\nAs established by the Constitution of Australia, the [[Parliament of Australia]] is composed of two houses, the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], together with the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarch]]. The monarch is represented through the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]], who has the [[executive power]] granted in the Constitution,{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=1}} as well as rarely exercised [[reserve powers]].{{sfn|McMinn|1979|p=155}} The reserve powers are those exercised by the governor-general without requiring advice, which is usually signified by the phrase \\\"Governor-General in Council\\\".<ref>Commonwealth of Australia Constitution s. 62</ref> Under The Australian Constitution the governor-general acts \\\"with the advice of the Federal Executive Council\\\" in the appointment of government ministers, although ministers serve at his pleasure, and the Executive Council is appointed by the governor-general alone.<ref>Commonwealth of Australia Constitution s. 63, s.64</ref> The governor-general is ordinarily bound by convention to act only upon the advice of the government and the [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], but can act independently and against advice in exercising the reserve powers.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=77}} The governor-general can be removed by the King on the advice of the Australian prime minister. As Liberal Party leader Malcolm Fraser, who played a large part in the crisis, put it, \\\"The Queen has tenure, and she couldn't be sacked. But a Governor-General holds office at pleasure, and if he ceases to please then he can be removed by a Prime Minister\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=135}}\\n\\nAs in most [[Westminster system]] parliaments, Australia's government is ordinarily formed by the party enjoying the [[Confidence and supply#Confidence|confidence]] of the lower House of Parliament, the House of Representatives. However, Australia's Parliament also has a powerful upper house, the Senate, which must pass any legislation initiated by the House of Representatives if it is to become law. The composition of the Senate, in which each state has an equal number of senators regardless of that state's population, was originally designed to attract the Australian colonies into one Federation.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=16\\u201317}} The Constitution forbids the Senate from originating or amending a [[money bill]], but places no limitation on the Senate's ability to defeat one. In 1970, Gough Whitlam, as Leader of the Opposition, stated of a budget bill, \\\"Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means on all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated, we will vote against the Bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and destroy the Government which has sponsored it\\\".{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=132}}\\n\\nThe federal Senate had never blocked supply before 1975, even when it had been controlled by the opposition. In 1947, in response to the federal [[Chifley government]]'s [[Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth|attempt to nationalise the banks]], the coalition-controlled upper house of the [[Parliament of Victoria]] blocked the state budget in order to force a premature election. Labor Premier [[John Cain (34th Premier of Victoria)|John Cain]] called a [[John Cain (34th Premier of Victoria)#Second Cain government|snap election]] and was defeated.<ref>{{cite AuDB | first = Robert | last = Murray | first2 = Kate | last2 = White | title = Cain, John (1882\\u20131957) | volume = 13 | year = 1993 | id2 = cain-john-9661}}</ref>{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=156\\u2013158}}\\n\\nPrior to the 1975 crisis, the governor-general's power to dismiss a prime minister against the incumbent's will under Section 64 of the Constitution had never been exercised. However, in 1904 Labour Prime Minister [[Chris Watson]] advised an early election, but Governor-General Lord Northcote refused, triggering Watson's resignation and the appointment of Opposition Leader [[George Reid]] as prime minister.<ref name=\\\"apmio1\\\">{{cite web\\n | title =Chris Watson, In office\\n | publisher =[[National Archives of Australia]]\\n | work =Australia's Prime Ministers\\n | url =http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/watson/in-office.aspx\\n | access-date =10 February 2010\\n| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160218184033/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/watson/in-office.aspx\\n | archive-date =18 February 2016\\n| url-status =dead\\n }}</ref> Twice since Federation, conflicts between [[Premiers of the Australian states|state premiers]] and [[Governors of the Australian states|state governors]], who perform analogous functions to the prime minister and governor-general respectively at the state level, had resulted in the departure of one or the other. In 1916, New South Wales Premier [[William Holman]] was expelled from the [[Australian Labor Party]] for supporting conscription. He managed to hold on to power with the aid of opposition parties and consulted the Governor, [[Sir Gerald Strickland]], proposing to pass legislation to extend the term of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|lower house of the state legislature]] by a year. When Strickland objected, stating that such a course was unfair to Labor, Holman had him replaced.{{sfn|McMinn|1979|pp=161\\u2013162}} In 1932 the New South Wales Labor premier, [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], refused to pay money owed to the Federal government, which froze the state's bank accounts, causing Lang to order that payments to the state government be only in cash. The governor, [[Sir Philip Game]], wrote to Lang, warning him that ministers were breaking the law, and that if they continued, he would have to obtain ministers who could carry on government within legal bounds. Lang replied that he would not resign, and [[Lang Dismissal Crisis|Game dismissed his government]] and commissioned the leader of the Opposition, [[Bertram Stevens (politician)|Bertram Stevens]], to form a caretaker government pending a new election, in which Labor was defeated.{{sfn|McMinn|1979|pp=162\\u2013163}}\\n\\nAmong the powers granted to the governor-general is the power to dissolve both houses of Parliament under Section 57 of the Constitution in the event that the House of Representatives twice passes a bill at least three months apart and the Senate refuses to pass it. In both instances where those circumstances arose prior to the Whitlam government, in 1914 and 1951, the governor-general dissolved Parliament for a \\\"[[double dissolution]]\\\" election on the advice of the prime minister.{{sfn|McMinn|1979|p=154}}\\n\\n=== Political ===\\nGough Whitlam's Labor government was [[1972 Australian federal election|elected in 1972]] after 23 years of rule by a [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]] formed by the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] and [[National Party of Australia|Country]] parties. The ALP Government enjoyed a nine-seat majority in the House of Representatives,{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=39}} but did not control the Senate,{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=45}} which had been elected in [[1967 Australian Senate election|1967]] and [[1970 Australian Senate election|1970]] (as Senate elections were then out of synchronisation with House of Representatives elections). In accordance with pre-election promises, it instituted a large number of policy changes, and offered much legislation. The Opposition, which still controlled the Senate, allowed some Government bills to pass the Senate, and blocked others.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=36\\u201337}}\\n\\nIn April 1974, faced with attempts by the Opposition under [[Billy Snedden]] to block supply (appropriation bills) in the Senate, Whitlam obtained the concurrence of the governor-general, Sir [[Paul Hasluck]], to a double dissolution.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=107}} Labor was returned at the [[1974 Australian federal election|election on 18 May]] with a reduced House majority of five seats. The Coalition and Labor each had 29 Senate seats, with the balance of power held by two independents.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=108}} Snedden later told author [[Graham Freudenberg]] when being interviewed for the book ''A Certain Grandeur \\u2013 Gough Whitlam in Politics'': \\\"The pressure [to block supply] was on me from [[Doug Anthony|Anthony]].

Whitlam wanted him to remain a further two years, but Hasluck declined, citing the refusal of his wife, [[Alexandra Hasluck|Alexandra]], to remain at [[Government House, Canberra|Yarralumla]] longer than the originally agreed five years.<ref name=\\\"Wurth 2010\\\" /> Whitlam offered the post to businessman [[Ken Myer]], who turned it down. Whitlam then offered the position to his treasurer, [[Frank Crean]], and his own deputy, [[Lance Barnard]], neither of whom was keen to move on from parliament.<ref>Jenny Hocking Gough Whitlam: His Time. Melbourne University Publishing 2012. {{ISBN|9780522857931}} p.132</ref> Finally, Whitlam turned to his fifth choice, [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], the chief justice of New South Wales. Kerr was reluctant to give up the chief justiceship, in which he intended to remain another ten years, for the governor-general's post, which traditionally lasted five years. At Kerr's request, Whitlam informally agreed that if both men were still in office in five years, Kerr would be reappointed. Whitlam also secured legislation to address Kerr's financial concerns about the position, including authorising a pension for the governor-general or his widow. The leader of the Opposition, [[Billy Snedden]], was enthusiastic about the appointment and also agreed to reappoint Kerr in five years, were he prime minister at the time. Kerr then agreed to take the post, was duly appointed by Queen [[Elizabeth&nbsp;II]], and was sworn in on 11 July 1974.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=16\\u201319}}\\n\\nSix of the bills that had been the subject of the double dissolution were introduced in Parliament a third time and, as expected, were again rejected by the Senate. Section 57 of the Constitution provides that, after a double dissolution election, if bills that had been rejected twice by the Senate in the previous parliament were again passed by the House and again rejected by the Senate, they could then be put to a [[Joint meetings of the Australian Parliament|joint sitting]] of both houses. On 30 July, Whitlam gained Kerr's agreement for a joint sitting, which was set for 6\\u20137 August 1974. [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|The joint sitting]], the only one in Australia's history under Section 57, passed all six bills, including the enabling legislation for [[Medibank]].{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=307}}\\n\\n=== Controversy and vacancies ===\\nIn December 1974, Whitlam was anxious to find new sources of money to finance his development plans. After a meeting at the prime minister's residence, [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]], Whitlam and three of his ministers ([[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Jim Cairns]], [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] Senator [[Lionel Murphy]], and Minister for Minerals and Energy [[Rex Connor]]) signed a letter of authority for Connor to borrow up to US$4&nbsp;billion. This letter was described by author and journalist [[Alan Reid (journalist)|Alan Reid]] as the \\\"death warrant of the Whitlam ALP government\\\".{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=1}}\\n\\nConnor and other ministers had made contact with a hitherto obscure Pakistani financier, Tirath Khemlani, as early as November 1974. Khemlani was said to have contacts in the newly enriched Arab oil nations.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=160\\u2013161}} None of the efforts to secure a loan, whether through Khemlani or by other routes, bore fruit, but, as information about the \\\"[[Loans Affair]]\\\" trickled out, the government lost support.{{sfn|Brown|2002|pp=128\\u2013129}}\\n\\nIn February 1975, Whitlam decided to appoint Senator Murphy a justice of the [[High Court of Australia]], even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for election if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win three of the five New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=206}} Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill [[Casual vacancies in the Australian Parliament|casual vacancies]] were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, [[Tom Lewis (Australian politician)|Tom Lewis]], a member of the Liberal Party, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect [[Cleaver Bunton]], former mayor of [[Albury]] and an independent.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=206\\u2013208}}\\n\\nBy March 1975, many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was doing an inadequate job as Leader of the Opposition and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=315}} Malcolm Fraser [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 1975|challenged Snedden for the leadership]] on 21 March, and defeated him by 37 votes to 27.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=317}} At a press conference after winning the leadership, Fraser stated:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nThe question of supply\\u2014let me deal with it this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene&nbsp;... Having said that&nbsp;... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd want to find a situation in which Mr Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=251}}\\n}}\\n\\nWhitlam's original deputy prime minister, [[Lance Barnard]], had been challenged and defeated for his post by Cairns in June 1974 shortly after the [[1974 Australian federal election|May 1974 election]]. Whitlam then offered Barnard a diplomatic post; in early 1975 Barnard agreed to this. If the appointment went through, Barnard's resignation from the House of Representatives would trigger [[1975 Bass by-election|a by-election]] in his Tasmanian electorate of [[Division of Bass|Bass]]. ALP officials felt that, given the party's weakened state, Barnard should remain in Parliament and be given no preferment if he resigned; party president and future Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] described the decision to appoint Barnard as \\\"an act of lunacy\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=193}} Barnard had been losing support over the last several elections, and the Liberals needed only a swing of 4% to take Bass off Labor. The Liberals had a candidate, [[Kevin Newman (politician)|Kevin Newman]], who had been nursing the electorate; Labor had no candidate selected and a bitter preselection in the offing.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=193\\u2013195}} Barnard resigned and was appointed the ambassador to Sweden. The election on 28 June proved a disaster for Labor, with Newman winning the seat on a swing of over 17%.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=106}}\\n\\nThe next week, Whitlam fired Cairns for misleading Parliament regarding the Loans Affair amid innuendo about his relationship with his Principal Private Secretary, [[Junie Morosi]]. He was replaced as deputy by [[Frank Crean]].{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|p=345}} At the time of Cairns' dismissal, one Senate seat was vacant, following the death on 30 June of Queensland ALP Senator [[Bertie Milliner]]. The state Labor party nominated [[Mal Colston]], who was the highest unelected candidate on the party's Queensland list in 1974. This resulted in deadlock in Brisbane; the unicameral Queensland legislature twice voted against Colston, and the party refused to submit any alternative candidates.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=107\\u2013109}} Queensland Country Party Premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] had evidence that Colston, a schoolteacher by trade, had set a school on fire during a labour dispute, though the police had refused to prosecute.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=457}} After the legislature voted Colston down a second time, Bjelke-Petersen instructed his majority in the legislature to elect a low-level union official, [[Albert Field]], who had contacted his office and expressed a willingness to serve. In interviews, Field made it clear he would not support Whitlam. Field was expelled from the ALP for standing against Colston, and Labor senators boycotted his swearing-in.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=107\\u2013109}} Whitlam argued that because of the vacancies being filled as they were, the Senate was \\\"corrupted\\\" and \\\"tainted\\\", with the Opposition enjoying a majority they did not win at the ballot box.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=109}} When Labor learned that Field had not given the required three weeks' notice to the [[Department of Education and Training (Queensland)|Queensland Department of Education]], it challenged his appointment in the High Court, arguing that he was still technically a public servant\\u2013and thus ineligible to serve in the Senate. With Field on leave throughout the remainder of the crisis, the Coalition refused to provide a \\\"[[pair (parliamentary convention)|pair]]\\\" to account for his absence, giving it an effective majority of 30\\u201329 in the Senate.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=375}} Whitlam remarked that if Milliner had not died or had he been replaced by a [pro Whitlam] senator, the crisis would not have happened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/publications/historical-documents/volume-27/Pages/507-despatch-james-to-callaghan|title = 507 Despatch, James to Callaghan}}</ref>\\n\\n== Deadlock ==\\n=== Deferral of supply ===\\n[[File:Senate, Old Parliament House, Canberra.JPG|right|thumb|The Senate chamber at the Old Parliament House]]\\nOn 10 October, the High Court ruled that the act passed at the joint sitting that gave the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) and the [[Northern Territory]] two senators each was valid. A half-Senate election needed to be held by June 1976; most senators-elect would take their seats on 1 July, but the territorial senators and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats would take their places at once.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=343\\u2013344}} The ruling meant that it was possible for the ALP to gain a temporary majority in the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976. To do so, the ALP would have to win Field's and Bunton's seats, and one seat in each territory, and have the second ACT seat fall to either a Labor candidate or an independent, former Liberal Prime Minister [[John Gorton]], now estranged from his party. If this happened, Labor would have an effective 33\\u201331 margin, would be able to pass supply if that was still an issue, and also could pass [[one vote, one value|electoral redistribution laws]] (which had been passed by the House, though twice defeated by the Senate) that would give it an advantage at the next election.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=354\\u2013356}}\\n\\nThe journalist and author [[Alan Reid (journalist)|Alan Reid]] described the position of the Government and Opposition as the crisis became acute in mid-October:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nWhile it was possibly an overstatement to describe the 1975 position as a choice between evils, neither of the two major political groupings reached the 15 October 1975 crunch position with completely clean hands. Fraser and the Liberal-CP senators&nbsp;... lacked the numbers to defer the Budget until the arrival in the Senate of Albert Patrick Field, whose arrival was not due to any decision by the Australian voters but to a decision by one of the rulers, the Whitlam-hating Bjelke-Petersen&nbsp;... Whitlam for his part had decided even before the Budget was deferred to embark upon the bold, Cromwellian project of changing the Australian Constitution, not through the vote of the mass electorate&nbsp;... but through prodigious personal exertions backed by the support of his parliamentary followers.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=364}}\\n}}\\n\\nIn the wake of the High Court ruling, and with the appropriation bills due to be considered by the Senate on 16 October, Fraser was undecided whether to block supply. His biographer, Philip Ayres, contends that, had there been no further government scandals, he would not have done so. Khemlani, however, had alleged \\u2013 contrary to government statements \\u2013 that Connor had never revoked his authority to obtain loans and had been in regular contact with him even into mid-1975. On 13 October, the [[The Herald (Melbourne)|Melbourne ''Herald'']] printed documents in support of Khemlani's allegations, and on the following day, Connor resigned.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=273\\u2013274}} Fraser determined to block supply, convened a [[shadow cabinet]] meeting and received the unanimous support of the Coalition frontbench.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=274\\u2013275}} At a press conference, Fraser cited the poor state of the economy and the continuing scandals as reasons for his decision. Without the passage of fresh appropriations, supply would be exhausted on 30 November.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=275\\u2013276}}\\n\\nOn 15 October the Governor of Queensland, Sir [[Colin Hannah]], gave a speech denigrating the Whitlam government, in violation of the convention that state governors remain neutral. Hannah held a [[dormant commission]] as [[Administrator (Australia)|Administrator of the Commonwealth]] to act as Governor-General in the event of Kerr's death, resignation, or absence from Australia. Whitlam immediately contacted [[Buckingham Palace]] to arrange for Hannah's dormant commission to be revoked, a process which took ten days to complete.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=370}} Although Whitlam later alleged that he never contemplated dismissing Kerr during the crisis, on 16 October, while speaking with Kerr and visiting Malaysian Prime Minister [[Abdul Razak Hussein|Tun Abdul Razak]], he told Kerr that if the crisis continued, \\\"It could be a question of whether I get to the Queen first for your recall, or whether you get in first with my dismissal\\\". Kerr saw the statement as a threat; Whitlam later stated the comment was \\\"flippant\\\" and designed to turn the conversation to another subject.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=131\\u2013132}}\\n\\nOn 16 and 17 October, the Senate, with the unanimous support of the Coalition majority, deferred the appropriation bills.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=275\\u2013276}} The Coalition took the position that Kerr could dismiss Whitlam if the Government could not secure supply. Whitlam's former solicitor-general [[Bob Ellicott]], now a Liberal member of the House, issued a legal opinion on 16 October stating that the Governor-General had the power to dismiss Whitlam, and should do so forthwith if Whitlam could not state how he would obtain supply. Ellicott indicated that Whitlam was treating Kerr as if he had no discretion but to follow prime ministerial advice, when in fact the Governor-General could and should dismiss a ministry unable to secure supply. Ellicott stated that Kerr\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nshould ask the Prime Minister if the Government is prepared to advise him to dissolve the House of Representatives and the Senate or the House of Representatives alone as a means of assuring that the disagreement between the two Houses is resolved. If the Prime Minister refuses to do either, it is then open to the Governor-General to dismiss his present Ministers and seek others who are prepared to give him the only proper advice open.

Whitlam advised Kerr not to do so, noting that no Governor-General had consulted with a Chief Justice under similar circumstances since 1914, when Australia was at a much earlier stage of her constitutional development.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=151}} Whitlam also noted that in all of the recent unsuccessful High Court challenges to Whitlam government legislation, Barwick had been in the minority in finding against the government.<ref>Jenny Hocking Gough Whitlam: His Time. Melbourne University Publishing. 2012. p.258</ref> On 21 October, Kerr phoned Whitlam regarding the Ellicott opinion, and asked, \\\"It's all bullshit, isn't it?\\\". Whitlam agreed with Kerr's view. Kerr then requested that the Government provide him with a written legal opinion rebutting Ellicott's views.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=386}} Kerr would receive no written advice from the Government until 6 November.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=152}} Journalist and author [[Paul Kelly (journalist)|Paul Kelly]], who wrote two books on the crisis, paints this delay as a major mistake by Whitlam, given Kerr's judicial background.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=152}} Kerr also asked on 21 October for Whitlam's permission to interview Fraser, which the Prime Minister readily granted, and the two men met that night. Fraser told Kerr that the Opposition were determined to block supply. Fraser indicated that the Opposition's decision to defer the appropriation bills, rather than defeating them, was a tactical decision, since then the bills would remain in the control of the Senate and could be passed at any time. He stated that the Coalition agreed with the Ellicott opinion, and proposed to continue deferring supply while it awaited events.{{sfn|Kerr|1978|pp=277\\u2013278}} The media were not told of the substance of the conversation, and instead reported that Kerr had reprimanded Fraser for blocking supply, causing the Governor-General's office to issue a denial.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=381\\u2013382}}\\n\\nThroughout the crisis, Kerr did not tell Whitlam of his increasing concerns, nor did he suggest that he might dismiss Whitlam. He believed nothing he said would influence Whitlam, and feared that, if Whitlam perceived him as a possible opponent, the Prime Minister would procure his dismissal from the Queen. Accordingly, though Kerr dealt with Whitlam in an affable manner, he did not confide his thinking to the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=167}} Labor Senator [[Tony Mulvihill]] later related that \\\"Whitlam would come back to each caucus meeting and say, 'I saw His Excellency&nbsp;... No worry. He's got to do it his way.'&nbsp;... at no time did he hint that the Governor-General was frowning.\\\"{{sfn|Lloyd|2008|p=347}}\\n\\nThere was intense public interest and concern at the stalemate, and Fraser and his Liberals acted to shore up support. Liberal frontbenchers worked to build unity for the tactic in state organisations. The former longtime [[Premier of South Australia]] Sir [[Thomas Playford IV|Thomas Playford]] was speaking out against the blocking of supply, causing South Australia Senator [[Don Jessop]] to waver in his support for the tactic. Fraser was able to co-ordinate a wave of communications from party members which served to neutralise both men. Fraser sought the backing of the retired longtime Liberal Prime Minister, Sir [[Robert Menzies]], and went to see Menzies in person, taking with him a 1947 statement by Menzies supporting the blocking of supply in the [[Victorian Legislative Council|upper house]] of the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Parliament]]. He did not have to use the paper; Menzies stated that he found the tactic distasteful, but in this case necessary. The former prime minister issued a statement in support of Fraser's tactics.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=156\\u2013158}}\\n\\nKerr invited Whitlam and [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Labour]] Senator [[Jim McClelland]] to lunch on 30 October, immediately preceding an [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Executive Council]] meeting. At that meal, Kerr proposed a possible compromise. If the Opposition were to allow supply to pass, Whitlam would not advise a half-Senate election until May or June 1976, and the Senate would not convene until 1 July, thus obviating the threat of a possible temporary Labor majority. Whitlam, who was determined to destroy both Fraser's leadership and the Senate's right to block supply, refused any compromise.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=382\\u2013383}}\\n\\n=== Decision ===\\n{{blockquote|text=Because of the federal nature of our Constitution and because of its provisions the Senate undoubtedly has constitutional power to refuse or defer supply to the Government.

If he refuses to do this I have the authority and indeed the duty under the Constitution to withdraw his Commission as Prime Minister. The position in Australia is quite different from a position in the United Kingdom. Here the confidence of both Houses on supply is necessary to ensure its provision.

The resulting communiqu\\u00e9 urged the Coalition senators to continue deferring supply. It also threatened, should Kerr grant Whitlam a half-Senate election, that the Coalition state premiers would advise their governors not to issue writs, thus blocking the election from taking place in the four states with non-Labor premiers.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=184\\u2013185}} After the meeting, Fraser proposed a compromise: that the Opposition would concede supply if Whitlam agreed to hold a House of Representatives election at the same time as the half-Senate election.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=185\\u2013186}} Whitlam rejected the idea.{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|pp=388\\u2013389}}\\n\\nOn 22 October, Whitlam had asked the [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], [[Kep Enderby]], to have a paper drafted rebutting the Ellicott opinion for presentation to Kerr. Enderby delegated this task to the Solicitor-General, [[Maurice Byers]], and other officials. On 6 November, Enderby was to see Kerr to give him a legal opinion regarding the Government's alternative plans in case supply ran out. Vouchers were to be issued to Commonwealth employees and contractors instead of cheques, to be redeemed from banks after the crisis ended\\u2014transactions which were to be rejected by major banks as \\\"tainted with illegality\\\".{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=400}} Enderby decided to present Kerr with the rebuttal to Ellicott. When Enderby reviewed the document, he found that, while it argued for the Government's position, it recognised both that the Senate had the constitutional right to block supply, and that the reserve powers were still extant\\u2014matters with which Enderby did not agree. He presented Kerr with the rebuttal, but crossed out Byers' signature on it and told Kerr of his disagreement. Enderby told Kerr that the Byers rebuttal was \\\"background\\\" for formal written advice, to be presented by Whitlam.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=287}} Later that day, Kerr met with Fraser again. The Opposition leader told him that if Kerr did not dismiss Whitlam, the Opposition planned to criticise him in Parliament for failing to carry out his duty.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=290}}\\n\\nKerr concluded on 6 November that neither Government nor Opposition would yield and had received advice that day from Treasurer Bill Hayden that supply would run out on 27 November.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=389}} The Governor-General decided that, as Whitlam could not secure supply, and would not resign or advise an election for the House of Representatives, he would have to sack him. As Kerr feared that Whitlam might advise the Queen to dismiss him, he considered it important that Whitlam be given no hint of the impending action. Kerr later stated that were Whitlam to seek his dismissal, it would involve the Queen in politics.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=215\\u2013217}} Seeking confirmation of his decision, he contacted Chief Justice Barwick, met with him and asked for his views of a dismissal of Whitlam. Barwick furnished him with written advice containing his view that a governor-general could and should dismiss a prime minister who was unable to obtain supply.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=222\\u2013226}} Barwick specified that the prime minister should also not have refused either to resign or to advise a general election, with which Kerr agreed.\\n\\nOn 9 November, Fraser contacted Whitlam and invited him to negotiations with the Coalition aimed at settling the dispute. Whitlam agreed, and a meeting was set for 9&nbsp;am on Tuesday 11 November, at Parliament House. That Tuesday was also the deadline for an election to be called if it were to be held before Christmas.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=392}} Both Government and Opposition leaders were in Melbourne on the night of 10 November for the Lord Mayor's banquet. To ensure the Opposition leaders could reach Canberra in time for the meeting, Whitlam brought them back in his VIP aircraft, which arrived in Canberra at midnight.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=291}}\\n\\n== Dismissal ==\\n=== Meeting at Yarralumla ===\\n[[File:Government House, Canberra.jpg|thumb|250px|Yarralumla, the official residence of the Governor-General]]\\n\\nAt 9&nbsp;a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, together with deputy prime minister [[Frank Crean]] and [[Leader of the House (Australia)|Leader of the House]] [[Fred Daly (politician)|Fred Daly]], met with Fraser and Country Party leader [[Doug Anthony]]. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders that he would be advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13 December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=245\\u2013247}} and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with [[Remembrance Day]] commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00&nbsp;p.m.,{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=247\\u2013248}} though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=255}} Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.{{sfn|Reid|1976|p=407}}\\n\\nAfter hearing from Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr asked him whether he, if commissioned prime minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and investigations of the Whitlam government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those questions were asked later in the day before Kerr commissioned Fraser as prime minister.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=249}} According to Kerr, Fraser was supposed to come to Yarralumla at 1.00&nbsp;pm.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=255}}\\n\\nWhitlam was delayed in leaving Parliament House, while Fraser left slightly early, with the result that Fraser arrived at Yarralumla first. He was taken into an anteroom, and his car was moved. Whitlam maintained that the purpose in moving Fraser's car was to ensure that the Prime Minister was not tipped off by seeing it, stating, \\\"Had I known Mr. Fraser was already there, I would not have set foot in Yarralumla\\\".{{sfn|Whitlam|1979|p=108}} Kelly doubted Whitlam would have recognised Fraser's car, which was an ordinary [[Ford LTD (Australia)|Ford LTD]] from the car pool.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=256}} According to Fraser biographer Philip Ayres, \\\"A white car pulled up at the front would signify nothing in particular\\u2014it would simply be in the way\\\".{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=295}}\\n\\nWhitlam arrived just before 1:00&nbsp;p.m. and was taken to Kerr's office by an aide. He brought with him the formal letter advising a half-Senate election, and after the two men were seated, attempted to give it to Kerr. According to Kerr, he interrupted Whitlam and asked if, as a result of the failure to find a compromise between party leaders, he intended to govern without parliamentary supply, to which the Prime Minister answered, \\\"Yes\\\". In their accounts of their meeting, both men agree that Kerr then told Whitlam about the decision to withdraw his commission as prime minister under Section&nbsp;64 of the Constitution.<ref>Section 64 of the Constitution empowers the Governor-General to appoint ministers of state, who \\\"shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General\\\".</ref> Kerr later wrote that at this point Whitlam got to his feet, looked at the office's phones, and stated, \\\"I must get in touch with the Palace at once\\\". According to Kerr, this indicated that Whitlam would not try to negotiate with him about a general election but contact the Queen for his recall, which gave him the final reason to carry out the dismissal; he answered that it was too late to get in touch with the Palace because Whitlam was not prime minister any more.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=256\\u2013257}}{{sfn|Kerr|1978|p=358}} Whitlam, however, later disputed that such words were spoken, and stated that he asked Kerr whether he had consulted the Palace, to which Kerr replied that he did not need to, and that he had the advice of Barwick. Both accounts agree that Kerr then handed Whitlam a letter of dismissal and statement of reasons, stating that they would both have to live with this, to which Whitlam replied, \\\"''You'' certainly will\\\". The dismissal concluded with Kerr wishing Whitlam luck in the election, and offering his hand, which the former prime minister took.{{sfn|Kerr|1978|p=358-359}}{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=257\\u2013259}}<ref>The dismissal letter, Kerr's statement of reasons and Barwick's advice are reproduced in {{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George|last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory |year=2014 |edition=6 |publisher=Federation Press |location=Leichhardt, NSW }} pp.&nbsp;361\\u2013365.

Fraser later stated that his overwhelming sensation at the news was relief.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=295}} Fraser left to return to Parliament House, where he conferred with Coalition leaders, while Kerr joined the luncheon party that had been waiting for him, apologising to his guests and offering the excuse that he had been busy dismissing the Government.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=263}}\\n\\n=== Parliamentary strategy ===\\nWhitlam returned to The Lodge, where he had lunch. When his aides arrived, he informed them of his sacking. Whitlam drafted a resolution for the House, expressing confidence in his Government. No ALP Senate leaders were at The Lodge, nor did Whitlam and his party contact any when they drove back to Parliament House, confining their strategy to the House of Representatives.{{sfn|Reid|1976|pp=414\\u2013415}}\\n\\nPrior to Whitlam's dismissal, the Labor leadership decided to introduce a motion that the Senate pass the appropriation bills. With ALP senators unaware of Whitlam's sacking, that plan went ahead. Senator [[Doug McClelland]], manager of the ALP Government's business in the Senate, informed Coalition Senate leader [[Reg Withers]] of Labor's intent at about 1.30&nbsp;pm. Withers then attended a leadership meeting where he learned of Fraser's appointment and assured the new prime minister he could secure supply. When the Senate convened, the ALP Senate leader, [[Ken Wriedt]], made the motion to pass the appropriation bills. As Wriedt did so, he was told that the government had been sacked, which he initially refused to believe. Authoritative word did not reach Wriedt until 2.15&nbsp;pm, by which time it was too late to withdraw the motion and instead obstruct his party's appropriation bill to hinder Fraser. At 2.24&nbsp;pm, Labor's appropriation bills passed the Senate, fulfilling Fraser's first promise of providing supply.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=267\\u2013269}}\\n\\nIn the House, desultory debate on Fraser's censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34&nbsp;pm, when Fraser rose and announced that he had been commissioned as prime minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of no confidence in him, and asked the Speaker, [[Gordon Scholes]], to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor-General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45&nbsp;pm.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=271}}\\n\\n=== Dissolution ===\\n[[File:Whitlam dismissal 19751111 Sydney.jpg|thumb|250px|Protest in [[George Street, Sydney]], outside the [[Sydney Town Hall]], about 6.45&nbsp;pm 11 November 1975 following news of the dismissal.]]\\n\\nAfter the appropriation bills were approved by both Houses, they were sent over to Yarralumla where Kerr gave them [[Royal Assent]]. With supply assured, Kerr then received Fraser, who advised him that 21&nbsp;bills (including the electoral redistribution bills) which had been introduced since the last election fulfilled the double dissolution provisions of Section&nbsp;57. Fraser asked that both Houses be dissolved for an election on 13 December. Kerr signed the proclamation dissolving Parliament, and sent his [[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia|Official Secretary]], [[David Smith (public servant)|David Smith]], to proclaim the dissolution from the front steps of Parliament House.{{sfn|Kerr|1978|pp=369\\u2013373}}\\n\\nAt 4.45, Kerr received Scholes, and informed him of the dissolution. Kerr wrote that \\\"nothing else of relevance\\\" took place between the two men,{{sfn|Kerr|1978|p=374}} but Scholes's account is that he accused Kerr of bad faith for making an appointment to receive the Speaker, and then not waiting to hear from him before dissolving Parliament.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=273}} Whitlam later stated that it would have been wiser for Scholes to take the appropriation bills with him, rather than having them sent ahead.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=271}} Kerr's action was based on the advice he had received from two High Court judges (Mason and Chief Justice Barwick) and the Crown Law Officers (Byers and Clarence Harders, the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department).<ref name=\\\"tragedy\\\" />{{sfn|Kerr|1978|pp=368\\u2013371}}<ref>See also Barwick's letter to Kerr 10 November 1975 and Kerr's letter to Sir Martin Charteris 11 November 1975.

The dismissal was by then publicly known, and an angry crowd of ALP supporters had gathered, filling the steps and spilling over both into the roadway and into Parliament House itself.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=274\\u2013275}} Many of the demonstrators were ALP staffers; others were from the [[Australian National University]].{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=297}} Smith was forced to enter Parliament House through a side door and make his way to the steps from the inside. He read the proclamation, though the boos of the crowd drowned him out, and concluded with the traditional \\\"God save the Queen\\\". Former Prime Minister Whitlam, who had been standing behind Smith, then addressed the crowd:{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=298}}\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nWell may we say \\\"God save the Queen\\\", because nothing will save the Governor-General! The Proclamation which you have just heard read by the Governor-General's Official Secretary was countersigned Malcolm Fraser, who will undoubtedly go down in Australian history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr's [[cur]]. They won't silence the outskirts of Parliament House, even if the inside has been silenced for a few weeks&nbsp;... Maintain your rage and enthusiasm for the campaign for the election now to be held and until polling day.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=275}}<ref name=\\\"Shaw 2005\\\" />\\n}}\\n\\n== Aftermath ==\\n=== Campaign ===\\n[[File:Domain 19751124.jpg|thumb|ALP policy launch before a huge crowd in the [[The Domain, Sydney|Sydney Domain]] on 24 November 1975 ]]\\n\\nThe news that Whitlam had been dismissed spread across Australia during the afternoon, triggering immediate protest demonstrations. On 12&nbsp;November, Scholes wrote to the Queen, asking her to restore Whitlam as prime minister. The reply from her [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|private secretary]], [[Martin Charteris, Baron Charteris of Amisfield|Sir Martin Charteris]], dated 17 November 1975, stated:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nAs we understand the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown in the hands of the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper for her to intervene in person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.{{sfn|Kerr|1978|pp=374\\u2013375}}\\n}}\\n\\nOn 12 November 1975, the [[First Fraser Ministry]] was sworn in by Kerr. By some accounts, Kerr sought reassurance at that meeting that the Coalition senators would not have given in before supply ran out, \\\"The Senate would never have caved in, would it?\\\" According to those accounts, Senator [[Margaret Guilfoyle]] laughed and said to a colleague, \\\"That's all he knows\\\".{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=412}} Guilfoyle later stated that, if she did make such a remark, it was not meant to imply that the Coalition senators would have broken.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=240}} However, Kelly lists four Coalition senators who stated, in subsequent years, that they would have crossed the floor and voted for the appropriation bills.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=240}}\\n\\nLabor believed it had a chance of winning the election, and that the dismissal would be an electoral asset for them.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=300}} However, some Labor strategists believed the party was heading for a disaster, with few economic accomplishments to point to and an electorate whose emotions would have cooled before polling day.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=302}} Nonetheless, Whitlam, who began campaigning almost immediately after the dismissal, was met with huge crowds wherever he went; 30,000&nbsp;people overspilled the [[The Domain, Sydney|Sydney Domain]] for the official campaign launch on 24 November.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=302}} That evening, Whitlam made a major speech at [[Festival Hall (Melbourne)|Festival Hall]] in Melbourne before 7,500&nbsp;people and a national TV audience, calling 11 November \\\"Fraser's day of shame\\u2014a day that will live in infamy\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1983|p=303}}\\n\\nPolls were released at the end of the first week of campaigning, and showed a nine-point swing against Labor. Whitlam's campaign did not believe it at first, but additional polling made it clear that the electorate was turning against the ALP. The Coalition attacked Labor for the economic conditions, and released television commercials \\\"The Three Dark Years\\\" showing images from the Whitlam government scandals. The ALP campaign, which had concentrated on the issue of Whitlam's dismissal, did not begin to address the economy until its final days. By that time Fraser, confident of victory, was content to sit back, avoid specifics and make no mistakes.{{sfn|Kelly|1983|pp=303\\u2013307}} There was little violence in the campaign, but three letter bombs were placed in the post; one wounded two people in Bjelke-Petersen's office, while the other two, addressed to Kerr and Fraser, were intercepted and defused.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=300}}\\n\\nDuring the campaign, the Kerrs purchased a Sydney apartment, as Sir John was prepared to resign in the event that the ALP triumphed.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=281}} In the [[1975 Australian federal election|13 December election]], the Coalition won a record victory, with 91&nbsp;seats in the House of Representatives to the ALP's 36 and a 35\\u201327 majority in the expanded Senate.{{sfn|Ayres|1987|p=301}}\\n\\n=== Reactions ===\\nThe dismissal is considered the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australia's history.<ref name=\\\"soru\\\" /> In 1977, the Fraser government proposed four constitutional amendments via [[1977 Australian referendum|referendum]], three of which passed\\u2014the last time that the Australian Constitution has been amended. [[Australian referendum, 1977 (Senate Casual Vacancies)|One of the amendments]] requires that a senator appointed to fill a casual vacancy be from the same party as the former senator.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=132}} The Senate retains the power to block supply; the governor-general retains the power to dismiss ministers (including the prime minister).{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=132}} However, these powers have not since been used to force a government from office.\\n\\nIn the wake of the dismissal, the ALP turned its anger on Kerr. Demonstrations marked his appearances, while the remaining ALP parliamentarians boycotted his opening of the new parliament. Whitlam, now Leader of the Opposition, refused all invitations to events at [[Government House, Canberra|Yarralumla]], which the Kerrs continued to extend until his refusal of an invitation during the Queen's 1977 visit caused them to feel that no further efforts need be made.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=281\\u2013282}} Whitlam never spoke with Kerr again.{{sfn|Kelly|1995|p=316}} Even ALP parliamentarians who had been friends of Kerr broke off their relationships, feeling Kerr had betrayed the party and had ambushed Whitlam. [[Anne Kerr, Lady Kerr|Lady Kerr]] stated that she and her husband confronted a \\\"new irrational scene swarming with instant enemies\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=282\\u2013283}}\\n\\nWhitlam repeatedly castigated Kerr for his role in the dismissal. When Kerr announced his resignation as governor-general on 14 July 1977, Whitlam commented: \\\"How fitting that the last of the [[Bourbons]] should bow out on [[Bastille Day]]\\\".{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=458}} After Kerr resigned as governor-general, he still sought a government position, reasoning that it had been his intent to remain for ten years as governor-general. However, Fraser's attempt to appoint Kerr as ambassador to [[UNESCO]] (a position later held by Whitlam) provoked such public outcry that the nomination was withdrawn. The Kerrs spent the next several years living in Europe,{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=284}} and when he died in Australia in 1991, his death was not announced until after he was buried.<ref name=\\\"LA Times 1991\\\" /> In 1991, Whitlam stated that no future governor-general was likely to act as Kerr did lest he also became the subject of \\\"contempt and isolation\\\".{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=206}} In 1997 he said that the letter of dismissal \\\"had the shortcomings of being ''[[ex tempore]]'', ''[[ex parte]]'', ''[[ad hoc]]'' and ''[[sub rosa]]''\\\".{{sfn|Whitlam|1997|p=2}} In 2005, Whitlam called Kerr \\\"a contemptible person\\\".<ref name=\\\"soru\\\" /> On the other hand, Country Party leader and deputy prime minister [[Doug Anthony]] said: \\\"I can't forgive Gough for crucifying him\\\".{{sfn|Kelly|1995|pp=282\\u2013283}} Sir Garfield Barwick was not spared Whitlam's invective; the former Prime Minister described him as \\\"evil\\\".{{sfn |Cohen|1996|p=209}} Though denied by both Kerr and Whitlam, unsubstantiated allegations have been made about [[Alleged CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal|CIA involvement in the Whitlam dismissal]].<ref>{{citation| last = Steketee| first = Mark| title = Carter denied CIA meddling| periodical = The Australian| date = 1 January 2008| url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/cabinet-papers/carter-denied-cia-meddling/story-e6frgd9x-1111115224991 | access-date = 19 May 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000551/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/cabinet-papers/carter-denied-cia-meddling/story-e6frgd9x-1111115224991| archive-date = 10 October 2010| url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\\\"Kelly-no-role\\\" />\\n\\nWhitlam resigned as ALP leader after the party suffered its second successive electoral defeat in [[1977 Australian federal election|1977]].{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|pp=460\\u2013461}} Fraser served over seven years as prime minister, and left the Liberal leadership after the Coalition was defeated in the [[1983 Australian federal election|March 1983 election]].{{sfn|Ayres|1987|pp=431\\u2013432}} Years later, Whitlam and Fraser put aside their differences; Whitlam wrote in 1997 that Fraser \\\"did not set out to deceive me\\\".{{sfn|Whitlam|1997|p=48}} The two campaigned together in support of [[1999 Australian republic referendum|the 1999 referendum]] that would have made Australia a republic.<ref name=\\\"Marks 1999\\\" /> According to Whitlam speechwriter [[Graham Freudenberg]], \\\"the residual rage over the conduct of the Queen's representative found a constructive outlet in the movement for the [[Australian Republic]]\\\".{{sfn|Freudenberg|2009|p=463}}\\n\\nFreudenberg summed up Kerr's fate after the dismissal:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\nThe beneficiaries of the Dismissal scarcely bothered to defend Kerr and in the end abandoned him.

Instead of releasing a single or video in advance of the album's release, Metallica embarked on a five-month American tour in support of [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

Over the course of his career, he played in various groups and performed a range of music including [[blues]], [[blues rock]], [[hard rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[jazz fusion]].\\n\\nInfluenced by [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] and [[Eric Clapton]], Moore began his career in the late 1960s when he joined [[Skid Row (Irish band)|Skid Row]], with whom he released two albums. After Moore left the group he joined [[Thin Lizzy]], featuring his former Skid Row bandmate and frequent collaborator [[Phil Lynott]]. Moore began his solo career in the 1970s and achieved major success with 1979's \\\"[[Parisienne Walkways]]\\\", which is considered his [[signature song]]. During the 1980s, Moore transitioned into playing hard rock and heavy metal with varying degrees of international success. In 1990, he returned to his roots with ''[[Still Got the Blues]]'', which became the most successful album of his career. Moore continued to release new music throughout his later career, collaborating with other artists from time to time. Moore died on 6 February 2011 from a heart attack while on holiday in Spain.\\n\\nMoore was often described as a [[virtuoso]] and has been cited as an influence by many other guitar players. He was voted as one of the greatest guitarists of all time on respective lists by ''[[Total Guitar]]'' and ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Louder]]''. Irish singer-songwriter [[Bob Geldof]] said that \\\"without question, [Moore] was one of the great Irish bluesmen\\\".<ref name=\\\"BBC obituary\\\">{{cite news |title=Irish rock guitarist Gary Moore: an obituary |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12382274 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=7 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208020612/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12382274 |archive-date=8 February 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=9 September 2020}}</ref> For most of his career, Moore was heavily associated with Peter Green's famed [[Greeny (guitar)|1959 Gibson Les Paul]] guitar.

The first installment in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|franchise of the same name]], it was the [[Firsts in animation|first entirely computer-animated feature film]], as well as the first feature film from Pixar. It was directed by [[John Lasseter]] (in his feature [[directorial debut]]) and produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], from a screenplay written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] and a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. The film features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (American actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\\n\\nTaking place in a world where [[toy]]s come to life when humans are not present, the plot of ''Toy Story'' focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and a modern space cadet action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz when he becomes their owner Andy's favorite toy.\\n\\nFollowing the success of ''[[Tin Toy]]'', a [[short film]] that was released in 1988, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film that was told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \\\"edgier\\\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \\\"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\\\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced ''Toy Story'' under minor financial constraints.\\n\\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22 of that year. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\\\"Numbers\\\" /> eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the [[1995 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1995]]. The film received critical acclaim and holds a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|{{RT data|score}} approval rating]] on film aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. It was praised for the technical innovation of the 3D animation, script, Newman's score, appeal to all age groups, and voice performances (particularly Hanks and Allen); it is frequently lauded as [[List of films considered the best#Animation (shorts and features)|one of the best animated films ever made]] and, due to its status as the first computer-animated film, one of the most important films in the medium's history and film at large.<ref name=\\\"best-animation\\\" /> The film received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations\\u2014[[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (the first animated film to be nominated for the award), [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \\\"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\\\", and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\\u2014in addition to being honored with a non-competitive [[Special Achievement Academy Award]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Susan |title=How 'Toy Story' changed the face of animation, taking off 'like an explosion' |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toy-story-anniversary-20150930-story.html |access-date=September 30, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070711/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toy-story-anniversary-20150930-story.html|archive-date=October 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2005, ''Toy Story'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\", one of nine films designated in its first year of eligibility.

Learning that Andy's birthday party has been unexpectedly moved to an earlier date, several toys \\u2014 including [[List of Toy Story characters#Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog (Toy Story)|Slinky Dog]], [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex the tyrannosaur]], [[Hamm (Toy Story)|Hamm the piggy bank]], and [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]] the [[porcelain doll]] \\u2014 become concerned that Andy might receive something that will replace them. To calm them, [[Sheriff Woody]], Andy's favorite toy and their ''[[de facto]]'' leader, sends [[Sarge (Toy Story)|Sarge]] and his [[Army men|green army men]] to spy on Andy's birthday party with a [[baby monitor]]. Andy receives a [[Buzz Lightyear]] [[action figure]], who believes he is an actual Space Ranger and does not know he is a toy. Buzz impresses the others with his high-tech features and becomes Andy's new favorite toy, provoking Woody's jealousy.\\n\\nTwo days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet. To ensure Andy brings him along and not Buzz, Woody tries knocking Buzz behind the desk with the [[radio-controlled car]] [[List of Toy Story characters#RC|RC]]. However, Buzz is accidentally knocked out of the bedroom window instead, and most of the other toys believe Woody has deliberately killed Buzz. Andy takes Woody with him, but Buzz furiously confronts him in the car. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind; after a further quarrel, they hitch a ride to the restaurant on a Pizza Planet delivery truck. \\n\\nAt Pizza Planet, Buzz mistakes a [[claw crane]] full of [[List of Toy Story characters#The Aliens|Little Green Men]] for a rocket, and climbs in, pursued by Woody. [[List of Toy Story characters#Phillips family|Sid Phillips]], Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor, takes the two from the crane to his house, where they encounter his [[English Bull Terrier|Bull Terrier]] [[List of Toy Story characters#Phillips family|Scud]] and his \\\"mutant\\\" toys, made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.\\n\\nBuzz, after watching a television commercial promoting him, realizes he is a toy after all. He attempts to fly but falls, breaks his arm, and suffers a mental breakdown. After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid tapes Buzz to a [[firework|rocket]], planning to blow him up the following day. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is to make Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to blow him up, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to \\\"break the rules\\\" and frighten Sid into never harming toys again.\\n\\nNow freed, Buzz and Woody pursue the Davis' [[moving truck]], but Scud attacks Woody. Buzz stays behind to fight off the dog; Woody climbs into the truck, and pushes RC out to rescue Buzz. Still thinking Woody has killed Buzz, the toys also toss him out of the truck. Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys see them and realize their mistake. RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket strapped to Buzz. Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide through the sunroof of Mrs. Davis' car, landing safely inside.\\n\\nAs the toys listen in on the [[Christmas]] gift opening in the new house, Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a [[List of Toy Story characters#Other|Mrs. Potato Head]]. Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be \\\"worse\\\" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a [[dachshund]] [[List of Toy Story characters#Buster|puppy]].\\n\\n== Voice cast ==\\n{{multiple image\\n| direction = horiztotal\\n| align = right\\n| total_width = 400\\n| footer = (left-to-right) [[Tom Hanks]] (pictured in 2016) and [[Tim Allen]] (2012), the voices of [[Woody (Toy Story)|Woody]] and [[Buzz Lightyear]] respectively\\n| image1 = Tom Hanks 2016.jpg\\n| image2 = Tim Allen 2012.jpg\\n}}\\n{{See also|List of Toy Story characters|l1=List of ''Toy Story'' characters}}\\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as Woody, a [[pullstring]] [[cowboy]] doll who is Andy's favorite toy.\\n* [[Tim Allen]] as Buzz Lightyear, a Space Ranger [[action figure]], Andy's second favorite toy, and Woody's rival, who later becomes his best friend.\\n* [[Don Rickles]] as Mr. Potato Head, a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body.\\n* [[Jim Varney]] as Slinky Dog, a [[dachshund]] [[slinky]] toy.\\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Rex, a nervous green ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' figurine.\\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Hamm, a smart-talking [[piggy bank]].\\n* [[Annie Potts]] as Bo Peep, a [[Bisque doll|porcelain]] shepherdess doll and Woody's love interest.\\n* [[John Morris (American actor)|John Morris]] as Andy Davis, the toys' owner.\\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as Sid Phillips, Andy's next-door neighbor and bully, who destroys toys for fun.\\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as Mrs. Davis, Andy and Molly's single mother.\\n* [[R.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988, Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', which was told from the perspective of a toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[61st Academy Awards|1989 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\\n\\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]], CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]], sought to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \\\"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\\\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film. {{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney film outside the studio.

They later learned that while Katzenberg was pushing the idea of working with Pixar, Schneider did not want to bring in a non-Disney animation studio. Katzenberg arranged to meet directly with the Pixar contingent, this time including Lasseter and Jobs. The Pixar team proposed a [[List of United States Christmas television specials|Christmas television special]], ''A Tin Toy Christmas'', as a first step, but Katzenberg countered that as long as they were gearing up to transition from 30-second commercials to a half-hour special, they might as well go all the way and make a feature-length film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\\n\\nKatzenberg also made it clear that he was only working with Pixar to get access to Lasseter's talents,{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} and that the Pixar team would be signing up to work with a self-described \\\"tyrant\\\" and micro-manager.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} However, he invited them to talk with Disney's animators and get their opinions on working under him and Lasseter was impressed with what he heard.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} The two companies began negotiations, although they disagreed on key points including whether Disney would get the rights to Pixar's animation technology{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} or whether Pixar would retain partial ownership of the films, characters, and home video and sequel rights.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} As Pixar was nearing bankruptcy and desperate for funds,{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} they settled on a deal that would allow Disney to have complete ownership and control of the films and characters, including the rights to make sequels without Pixar's involvement, while Pixar would get approximately 12.5% of ticket sales.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\\\"BizWeekBOX\\\" /> These early negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}\\n\\nAn agreement to produce a feature film based on ''Tin Toy'' with a working title of ''Toy Story'' was finalized, and production began soon thereafter.<ref name=\\\"PixMagicMan\\\">{{cite news |last=Schlender |first=Brent |url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm |title=Pixar's magic man |date=May 17, 2006 |publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]] |access-date=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715081233/http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Writing ===\\nOriginally, ''Toy Story'' was going to feature \\\"Tinny\\\", the wind-up one-man band toy from the ''Tin Toy'' short film, along with \\\"the dummy\\\", a [[ventriloquist's dummy]]. While the film's premise was still about toys' desire to be played with by children, the rest of the film's script, which involved Tinny being left behind at a gas station, meeting up with the dummy, and having a series of adventures before finding their way into a kindergarten classroom where they can be played with every day, was quite different.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=121}} Katzenberg was unhappy with the [[Film treatment|treatment]] drafted by Lasseter, [[Andrew Stanton]], and [[Pete Docter]], as the two character's motivations were too similar. Instead, he encouraged them to write it as a [[buddy film]], giving the two main characters contrasting personalities, and having them only become friends after being forced to work together.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter delivered a revised treatment in September 1991 that more closely resembles the final version of the film: Tinny replaces the ventriloquist dummy as a child's favorite toy, their bickering causes them to be left behind at a gas station, they almost catch up to the family at a pizza restaurant, they have to escape a kid that mutilates toys, and the movie ends with a chase scene as the two toys try to catch up to the family's moving van.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}}\\n\\nThe script went through many changes before the final version of it. Lasseter decided Tinny was \\\"too antiquated\\\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure in the likes of ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' and was then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually [[Buzz Lightyear]] (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as the aforementioned ''G.I.

Convergent evolution creates '''analogous structures''' that have similar form or function but were not present in the [[last common ancestor]] of those groups. The [[cladistic]] term for the same phenomenon is [[Cladogram#Homoplasies|homoplasy]]. The [[recurrent evolution]] of flight is a classic example, as flying [[pterygota|insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[pterosaurs]], and [[bat]]s have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are ''analogous'', whereas ''[[homology (biology)|homologous]]'' structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions.  Bird, bat, and pterosaur [[wings]] are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions.\\n\\nThe opposite of convergence is [[divergent evolution]], where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution is similar to [[parallel evolution]], which occurs when two independent species evolve in the same direction and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, [[flying frog|gliding frog]]s have evolved in parallel from multiple types of [[tree frog]].\\n\\nMany instances of convergent evolution are known in [[plant]]s, including the repeated development of [[C4 photosynthesis|C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis]], [[seed dispersal]] by fleshy [[fruit]]s adapted to be eaten by animals, and [[carnivorous plant|carnivory]].\\n\\n==Overview==\\n[[File:Analogous & Homologous Structures.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Homology (biology)|Homology]] and analogy in mammals and insects: on the horizontal axis, the structures are homologous in morphology, but different in function due to differences in habitat.

From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene ([[genetic drift|selectively neutral]]) has a steadily decreasing [[probability]] of retaining potential functionality over time.

During much of the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period, the town was contested between the Byzantines and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], whose capital it was between 972 and 992. In 1004, when it was seized by the Byzantine Empire, the city became a centre of a new [[Theme (Byzantine district)|province]] called [[Theme of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. From 1282, the town was part of the [[Serbian Empire]] and was its capital city from 1346 to 1371. \\n\\nIn 1392, Skopje was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turk]]s, who called it {{lang|ota-Latn|\\u00dcsk\\u00fcb}} ({{lang|ota|\\u0627\\u0633\\u06a9\\u0648\\u0628}}).{{Efn|This name was also in use in English for a time.}} The town stayed under Ottoman control for over 500 years, serving as the capital of the [[Sanjak|pashasanjak]] of {{lang|ota-Latn|\\u00dcsk\\u00fcp}} and later the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]]. Its central position in the [[Ottoman Balkans]] made it a significant centre of commerce and administration during the Ottoman era. In 1912, it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] during the [[Balkan Wars]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC&dq=serbia++annexed++1912&pg=PA40 40]}} During [[World War I]] the city was seized by the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], and, after the war, it became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] as the capital of [[Vardarska Banovina]]. In [[World War II]], the city was again captured by Bulgaria and in 1945 became the capital of [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|SR Macedonia]], a [[federated state]] within [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>John B., Bell, Martin, ''Conflict in the former Yugoslavia: an Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 1998, p. 270, {{ISBN|0874369355}}.</ref> The city developed rapidly, but this was interrupted in 1963 when it was hit by [[1963 Skopje earthquake|a disastrous earthquake]].\\n\\nSkopje is on the upper course of the [[Vardar]] River and is on a major north\\u2013south [[Balkans|Balkan]] route between [[Belgrade]] and [[Athens]]. It is a centre for the chemical, timber, textile, leather, printing, and metal-processing industries. Industrial development of the city has been accompanied by development of the trade, logistics, and banking sectors, as well as an emphasis on the fields of transportation, culture and sport.

Macedonians live south of the [[Vardar]], in areas massively rebuilt after 1963, and Muslims live on the northern side, in the oldest neighbourhoods of the city.

This is especially true for [[Topaana]], in [[\\u010cair municipality]], and for [[\\u0160uto Orizari municipality]], which are the two main Roma neighbourhoods. They are made of many illegal constructions not connected to electricity and water supply, which are passed from one generation to another. Topaana, close to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]], is a very old area: it was first mentioned as a Roma neighbourhood in the beginning of the 14th century. It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. \\u0160uto Orizari, on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with [[Romani language|Romani]] as its local official language.

They were five: [[Centar Municipality (Skopje)|Centar]], [[\\u010cair municipality|\\u010cair]], [[Karpo\\u0161 municipality|Karpo\\u0161]], [[Gazi Baba municipality|Gazi Baba]] and [[Kisela Voda municipality|Kisela Voda]]. After the 1991 independence of the country, power was centralized and municipalities lost much of their competences. A 1996 law restored them and created two new municipalities: [[\\u01f4or\\u010de Petrov municipality|\\u01f4or\\u010de Petrov]] and [[\\u0160uto Orizari municipality|\\u0160uto Orizari]]. After the [[2001 insurgency in Macedonia|insurgency between Albanian rebels and Macedonian forces]] in 2001, a new law was enacted in 2004 to incorporate [[Saraj Municipality]] into the City of Skopje. Saraj is mostly populated by Albanians and, since then, Albanians represent more than 20% of the city population. Thus Albanian became the second official language of the city administration, something which was one of the claims of the Albanian rebels. The same year, [[Aerodrom Municipality (Skopje)|Aerodrom Municipality]] separated itself from Kisela Voda, and [[Butel Municipality]] from \\u010cair.<ref name=\\\"local\\\"/>\\n\\nMunicipalities are administered by a council of 23 members elected every four years. They also have a mayor and several departments (education, culture, finances...).

Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups: [[Regular Masonic jurisdiction|Regular Freemasonry]], which insists that a volume of [[scripture]] be open in a working lodge, that every member professes belief in a [[God|Supreme Being]], that no women be admitted, and that the discussion of religion and politics do not take place within the lodge; and [[Continental Freemasonry]], which consists of the jurisdictions that have removed some, or all, of these restrictions. \\n\\nThe basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]]. These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level (usually coterminous with a state, province, or national border) by a [[Grand Lodge]] or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.\\n\\nThe degrees of Freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft [[Guild|guilds]], those of [[Apprenticeship|Entered Apprentice]], [[Journeyman]] or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and [[Master craftsman|Master Mason]]. The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry and entrusted with grips, signs, and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated. The degrees are part allegorical [[morality play]] and part lecture. These three degrees form Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry, and members of any of these degrees are known as '''Freemasons''' or '''Masons'''. Once the Craft degrees have been conferred upon a Mason, he is qualified to join various \\\"Concordant bodies\\\" which offer additional degrees. These organisations are usually administered separately from the Grand Lodges who administer the Craft degrees. The extra degrees vary with locality and [[jurisdiction]].

The process varies among Grand Lodges, but in modern times interested people often look up a local Lodge through the Internet and will typically be introduced to a Lodge social function or open evening. The onus is upon candidates to ask to join; while they may be encouraged to ask, they may not be invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, a formal application may be proposed and seconded or announced in open Lodge and a more or less formal interview usually follows. If the candidate wishes to proceed, references are taken up during a period of notice so that members may enquire into the candidate's suitability and discuss it.

(In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.<ref>[http://www.themasonictrowel.com/ebooks/fm_freemasonry/Lang_-_History_Of_Freemasonry_in_NewYork_1922_raw.pdf Ossian Lang, \\\"History of Freemasonry in the State of New York\\\" (pdf)], 1922, pp. 135\\u2013140, ''Masonic Trowel eBooks'', {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201003501/http://www.themasonictrowel.com/ebooks/fm_freemasonry/Lang_-_History_Of_Freemasonry_in_NewYork_1922_raw.pdf|date=1 December 2010}}</ref>) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two overlapping Grand Lodges are themselves in amity and agree to share jurisdiction.

When the British military Lodge left North America after the end of the Revolution, those 15 men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Grand Lodge of England (Moderns) and formed [[African Lodge No. 459|African Lodge, Number 459]]. When the two English grand lodges united in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls&nbsp;\\u2013 largely because of the [[War of 1812]]. Thus, separated from both English jurisdiction and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge retitled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1&nbsp;\\u2013 and became a ''de facto'' Grand Lodge.

Each lodge and grand lodge had their own rules, both written and unwritten. A few non-Prince Hall lodges did admit Blacks, with [[Angelo Soliman]] being one notable Masonic personality of African descent. Nonetheless, widespread [[racial segregation]] in 19th- and early 20th-century North America made it difficult for African Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions. Even if a lodge was willing to entertain non-White applicants, generally only a single anonymous vote could prevent someone from being admitted. Inter-jurisdiction recognition between traditional and Prince Hall U.S. Masonic authorities was also not forthcoming. As demonstrated by the case of the famous black boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], if word spread that a mainstream lodge had admitted a Black person, that lodge could potentially face sanction from other discriminatory lodges.{{cn|date=June 2024}}\\n\\nBy the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past.

They promoted the ideals of the Enlightenment and helped diffuse these values across Britain and France and other places. British Freemasonry offered a systematic creed with its own myths, values and set of rituals. It fostered new codes of conduct \\u2013 including a communal understanding of liberty and equality inherited from guild sociability \\u2013 \\\"liberty, fraternity, and equality\\\"<ref>Margaret C.

In other words, the micro-society set up within the lodges constituted a normative model for society as a whole. This was especially true on the Continent: when the first lodges began to appear in the 1730s, their embodiment of British values was often seen as threatening by state authorities. For example, the Parisian lodge that met in the mid-1720s was composed of English [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] exiles.<ref>Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment,'' pp. 20, 73, 89.</ref> Furthermore, freemasons all across Europe made reference to the Enlightenment in general in the 18th century. In French lodges, for example, the line \\\"As the means to be enlightened I search for the enlightened\\\" was a part of their initiation rites. British lodges assigned themselves the duty to \\\"initiate the unenlightened\\\". Many lodges praised the Grand Architect, the masonic terminology for the divine being who created a scientifically ordered universe.<ref>Jacob, ''Living the Enlightenment,'' pp. 145\\u2013147.</ref>\\n\\nOn the other hand, historian [[Robert Roswell Palmer]] noted that lodges operated separately and Masons politically did not act together as a group.<ref>Robert R.

These individuals had been active Masons in Paris, where lodges were politically active in the new Radical Party. In Russia, the Freemasons supported constitutional liberalism, and maintained ties with France while simplifying many of the ceremonial rituals. Their secret meetings became a centre of progressive ideals, attracting politicians and activists. The lodges initially supported World War I, promoting close ties with France. [[Alexander Kerensky]] was an important Masonic activist who came to political power with the overthrow of the czars, in 1917. The organization collapsed as the Bolsheviks took power and was again outlawed.<ref>Ludwik Hass, \\\"The Russian Masonic Movement in the Years 1906\\u20131918.\\\" ''Acta Poloniae Historica'' 48 (1983): 95\\u2013131.</ref>\\n\\n===Italy===\\n{{Further|Freemasonry in Italy}}\\nAccording to Adrian Lyttelton, in the early 20th century, Freemasonry was an influential but semi-secret force in Italian politics; with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, its appeal spread to the leadership of the parliament, public administration, and the army. The two main organisations were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had around 25,000 members in some 500 lodges. Freemasons typically espoused [[anticlericalism]] and promoted unification. The Catholic Church was a vigorous opponent of unification, and thus of the Freemasons; various national governments would repeatedly alternate and backpedal between the anticlerical side and the Church side.<ref>Adrian Lyttelton, \\\"An Old Church and a New State: Italian Anticlericalism 1876\\u20131915.\\\" ''European Studies Review'' 13.2 (1983): 225\\u2013248.</ref> Politically, they promoted [[Italian nationalism]] focused on unification and undermining the power of the Catholic Church. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, encouraging public opinion and the leading political parties in support of [[Italian entry into World War I|Italy's joining of the Allies]] of the First World War in 1914\\u20131915. In 1919, they favoured a [[League of Nations]] to promote a new post-war, universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations.<ref>Fulvio Conti, \\\"From Universalism to Nationalism: Italian Freemasonry and the Great War.\\\" ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 20.5 (2015): 640\\u2013662.</ref> In the early 1920s, many of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s collaborators, especially the leaders in organizing the [[March on Rome]], were Masons.

The former [[archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams|Dr Rowan Williams]], appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, while being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England.

Macedonians live south of the [[Vardar]], in areas massively rebuilt after 1963, and Muslims live on the northern side, in the oldest neighbourhoods of the city.

They are made of many illegal constructions not connected to electricity and water supply, which are passed from one generation to another. Topaana, close to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]], is a very old area: it was first mentioned as a Roma neighbourhood in the beginning of the 14th century. It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. \\u0160uto Orizari, on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with [[Romani language|Romani]] as its local official language.

They were five: [[Centar Municipality (Skopje)|Centar]], [[\\u010cair municipality|\\u010cair]], [[Karpo\\u0161 municipality|Karpo\\u0161]], [[Gazi Baba municipality|Gazi Baba]] and [[Kisela Voda municipality|Kisela Voda]]. After the 1991 independence of the country, power was centralized and municipalities lost much of their competences. A 1996 law restored them and created two new municipalities: [[\\u01f4or\\u010de Petrov municipality|\\u01f4or\\u010de Petrov]] and [[\\u0160uto Orizari municipality|\\u0160uto Orizari]]. After the [[2001 insurgency in Macedonia|insurgency between Albanian rebels and Macedonian forces]] in 2001, a new law was enacted in 2004 to incorporate [[Saraj Municipality]] into the City of Skopje. Saraj is mostly populated by Albanians and, since then, Albanians represent more than 20% of the city population. Thus Albanian became the second official language of the city administration, something which was one of the claims of the Albanian rebels.

Modern Freemasonry broadly consists of two main recognition groups: [[Regular Masonic jurisdiction|Regular Freemasonry]], which insists that a volume of [[scripture]] be open in a working lodge, that every member professes belief in a [[God|Supreme Being]], that no women be admitted, and that the discussion of religion and politics do not take place within the lodge; and [[Continental Freemasonry]], which consists of the jurisdictions that have removed some, or all, of these restrictions. \\n\\nThe basic, local organisational unit of Freemasonry is the [[Masonic Lodge|Lodge]]. These private Lodges are usually supervised at the regional level (usually coterminous with a state, province, or national border) by a [[Grand Lodge]] or Grand Orient. There is no international, worldwide Grand Lodge that supervises all of Freemasonry; each Grand Lodge is independent, and they do not necessarily recognise each other as being legitimate.\\n\\nThe degrees of Freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft [[Guild|guilds]], those of [[Apprenticeship|Entered Apprentice]], [[Journeyman]] or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and [[Master craftsman|Master Mason]]. The candidate of these three degrees is progressively taught the meanings of the symbols of Freemasonry and entrusted with grips, signs, and words to signify to other members that he has been so initiated. The degrees are part allegorical [[morality play]] and part lecture. These three degrees form Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry, and members of any of these degrees are known as '''Freemasons''' or '''Masons'''. Once the Craft degrees have been conferred upon a Mason, he is qualified to join various \\\"Concordant bodies\\\" which offer additional degrees. These organisations are usually administered separately from the Grand Lodges who administer the Craft degrees. The extra degrees vary with locality and [[jurisdiction]]. In addition to these bodies, there are further organizations outside of the more traditional [[List of Masonic rites|Rites]] of Freemasonry, that require an individual to be a Master Mason before they can join (such as the [[Rosicrucian Society of England]]).\\n\\nThroughout its history, freemasonry has received [[Anti-Masonry|criticism and opposition]] on religious and political grounds. The Catholic Church, some Protestant denominations, and certain Islamic countries or entities have expressed opposition to or banned membership in freemasonry. Opposition to freemasonry is sometimes rooted in [[anti-Semitism]] or [[conspiracy theories]], and freemasons have historically been persecuted by authoritarian states.\\n\\n==Masonic lodge==\\n{{Main|Masonic lodge}}\\n[[File:Palazzo Roffia, galleria 00.JPG|thumb|alt=Italian lodge at Palazzo Roffia, Florence|Lodge in Palazzo Roffia, [[Florence]], set out for French (Moderns) ritual]]\\nThe [[Masonic lodge]] is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chevalierramsay.be/what-is-freemasonry/|title=What is Freemasonry|website=www.chevalierramsay.be|access-date=14 June 2017}}</ref> The Lodge meets regularly and conducts the usual formal business of any small organisation (approve [[minutes]], elect new members, appoint officers and take their reports, consider correspondence, bills and annual accounts, organise social and charitable events, etc.).

Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively ''initiated'' into Freemasonry, first in the degree of '''Entered Apprentice'''. At some later time, in separate ceremonies, they will be ''passed'' to the degree of '''Fellowcraft'''; and then ''raised'' to the degree of '''Master Mason'''.

The process varies among Grand Lodges, but in modern times interested people often look up a local Lodge through the Internet and will typically be introduced to a Lodge social function or open evening. The onus is upon candidates to ask to join; while they may be encouraged to ask, they may not be invited. Once the initial inquiry is made, a formal application may be proposed and seconded or announced in open Lodge and a more or less formal interview usually follows. If the candidate wishes to proceed, references are taken up during a period of notice so that members may enquire into the candidate's suitability and discuss it. Finally, the Lodge takes an officially secret ballot on each application before a candidate is either initiated or rejected.<ref name=\\\"MLoE\\\">[http://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/become-a-free-mason.html \\\"How to become a Freemason\\\"], ''Masonic Lodge of Education'', retrieved 20 November 2013</ref> The exact number of adverse ballots (\\\"blackballs\\\") required to reject a candidate varies between Masonic jurisdictions.

(For example, in England the standard minimum age to join is 18, but university lodges are given dispensations to initiate undergraduates below that age.)\\n \\nAdditionally, most Grand Lodges require a candidate to declare a belief in a [[God|Supreme Being]] (although every candidate must interpret this condition in his own way, as all religious discussion is commonly prohibited). In a few cases, the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion.

There are many reasons one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are ''Exclusive Jurisdiction'' and ''Regularity''.<ref>[http://www.pilarlodge3freemasonry.freeservers.com/about_1.html Jim Bantolo, \\\"On Recognition\\\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314135120/http://www.pilarlodge3freemasonry.freeservers.com/about_1.html |date=14 March 2008 }}, Masonic Short Talk, ''Pilar lodge'', 2007, retrieved 25 November 2013</ref>\\n\\n====Exclusive Jurisdiction====\\nExclusive Jurisdiction is a concept whereby normally only one Grand Lodge will be recognised in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.<ref>[http://www.themasonictrowel.com/ebooks/fm_freemasonry/Lang_-_History_Of_Freemasonry_in_NewYork_1922_raw.pdf Ossian Lang, \\\"History of Freemasonry in the State of New York\\\" (pdf)], 1922, pp. 135\\u2013140, ''Masonic Trowel eBooks'', {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201003501/http://www.themasonictrowel.com/ebooks/fm_freemasonry/Lang_-_History_Of_Freemasonry_in_NewYork_1922_raw.pdf|date=1 December 2010}}</ref>) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two overlapping Grand Lodges are themselves in amity and agree to share jurisdiction. For example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both.<ref>[http://www.bessel.org/exclartl.htm \\\"Exclusive Jurisdiction\\\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002511/http://www.bessel.org/exclartl.htm |date=3 December 2013 }}, ''Paul M.

Essentially, every Grand Lodge will hold that ''its'' landmarks (its requirements, tenets and rituals) are Regular, and judge other Grand Lodges based on those.

When the British military Lodge left North America after the end of the Revolution, those 15 men were given the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the Grand Lodge of England (Moderns) and formed [[African Lodge No. 459|African Lodge, Number 459]]. When the two English grand lodges united in 1813, all U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls&nbsp;\\u2013 largely because of the [[War of 1812]]. Thus, separated from both English jurisdiction and any concordantly recognised U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge retitled itself as the African Lodge, Number 1&nbsp;\\u2013 and became a ''de facto'' Grand Lodge. (This lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges in Africa.)

Each lodge and grand lodge had their own rules, both written and unwritten. A few non-Prince Hall lodges did admit Blacks, with [[Angelo Soliman]] being one notable Masonic personality of African descent. Nonetheless, widespread [[racial segregation]] in 19th- and early 20th-century North America made it difficult for African Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions. Even if a lodge was willing to entertain non-White applicants, generally only a single anonymous vote could prevent someone from being admitted. Inter-jurisdiction recognition between traditional and Prince Hall U.S. Masonic authorities was also not forthcoming. As demonstrated by the case of the famous black boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], if word spread that a mainstream lodge had admitted a Black person, that lodge could potentially face sanction from other discriminatory lodges.{{cn|date=June 2024}}\\n\\nBy the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past.

These individuals had been active Masons in Paris, where lodges were politically active in the new Radical Party. In Russia, the Freemasons supported constitutional liberalism, and maintained ties with France while simplifying many of the ceremonial rituals. Their secret meetings became a centre of progressive ideals, attracting politicians and activists. The lodges initially supported World War I, promoting close ties with France. [[Alexander Kerensky]] was an important Masonic activist who came to political power with the overthrow of the czars, in 1917. The organization collapsed as the Bolsheviks took power and was again outlawed.<ref>Ludwik Hass, \\\"The Russian Masonic Movement in the Years 1906\\u20131918.\\\" ''Acta Poloniae Historica'' 48 (1983): 95\\u2013131.</ref>\\n\\n===Italy===\\n{{Further|Freemasonry in Italy}}\\nAccording to Adrian Lyttelton, in the early 20th century, Freemasonry was an influential but semi-secret force in Italian politics; with a strong presence among professionals and the middle class across Italy, its appeal spread to the leadership of the parliament, public administration, and the army. The two main organisations were the Grand Orient and the Grand Lodge of Italy. They had around 25,000 members in some 500 lodges. Freemasons typically espoused [[anticlericalism]] and promoted unification. The Catholic Church was a vigorous opponent of unification, and thus of the Freemasons; various national governments would repeatedly alternate and backpedal between the anticlerical side and the Church side.<ref>Adrian Lyttelton, \\\"An Old Church and a New State: Italian Anticlericalism 1876\\u20131915.\\\" ''European Studies Review'' 13.2 (1983): 225\\u2013248.</ref> Politically, they promoted [[Italian nationalism]] focused on unification and undermining the power of the Catholic Church. Freemasons took on the challenge of mobilizing the press, encouraging public opinion and the leading political parties in support of [[Italian entry into World War I|Italy's joining of the Allies]] of the First World War in 1914\\u20131915. In 1919, they favoured a [[League of Nations]] to promote a new post-war, universal order based upon the peaceful coexistence of independent and democratic nations.<ref>Fulvio Conti, \\\"From Universalism to Nationalism: Italian Freemasonry and the Great War.\\\" ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' 20.5 (2015): 640\\u2013662.</ref> In the early 1920s, many of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s collaborators, especially the leaders in organizing the [[March on Rome]], were Masons. The lodges hailed [[fascism]] as the saviour of Italy from [[Bolshevism]]; however, Mussolini decided he needed to come to terms with the Catholic Church, in the mid-1920s, outlawing Freemasonry.<ref>Martin Clark, ''Modern Italy 1871\\u20131995'' (1996) p. 254.</ref>\\n\\n===Latin America===\\nThe Spanish government outlawed Freemasonry in its overseas empire in the mid-18th century, and energetically enforced the ban.

In recent decades, however, reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism, perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church. The former [[archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams|Dr Rowan Williams]], appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, while being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons inside and outside the Church of England. In 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth.<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/04/20/nmason20.xml&sSheet=/news/2003/04/20/ixhome.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071123132655/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F04%2F20%2Fnmason20.xml&sSheet=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F04%2F20%2Fixhome.html | archive-date = 23 November 2007 | title = Rowan Williams apologises to Freemasons | first = Chris | last = Hastings | author2 = Elizabeth Day | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 20 April 2003 | access-date = 9 July 2007 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\nIn 1933, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Church of Greece]] officially declared that being a Freemason constitutes an act of [[Apostasy in Christianity|apostasy]] and thus, until he repents, the person involved with Freemasonry cannot partake of the [[Eucharist]].

Designed for coastal defense, the ''Kearsarge''-class battleships had a low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] and heavy armor. The ships carried an armament of four {{convert|13|in|adj=on|0}} and four {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} guns in an unusual two-story turret arrangement. The [[Newport News Shipbuilding Company]] of Virginia [[keel laying|laid down]] her [[keel]] on 30 June 1896.

Between 1901 and 1904, she served in East Asia, and from 1904 to 1907 she cruised the Atlantic. In 1907, she joined the [[Great White Fleet]] on its world tour, returning to the United States in 1909. She was modernized between 1909 and 1911, but did not operate again until 1915, when she sailed to the Mexican coast to participate in the American intervention in the [[Mexican Revolution]], where she stayed until 1916. From 1917 until her decommissioning on 29 May 1920, she served as a [[training ship]].

an [[enzyme]] responsible for the metabolism of excess phenylalanine.<ref name=NIH2016/> This results in the buildup of dietary phenylalanine to potentially toxic levels.<ref name=NIH2016/> It is [[autosomal recessive]], meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the condition to develop.<ref name=NIH2016/> There are two main types, classic PKU and variant PKU, depending on whether any enzyme function remains.<ref name=NIH2016/> Those with one copy of a mutated gene typically do not have symptoms.<ref name=NIH2016>{{cite

When maternal blood Phe levels fall below 2&nbsp;mg/dL, anecdotal reports indicate that the mothers may experience adverse effects, including headaches, nausea, hair loss, and general malaise.

A solvent is usually a liquid but can also be a solid, a gas, or a [[supercritical fluid]]. Water is a solvent for [[Chemical polarity#Polarity of molecules|polar molecules]], and the most common solvent used by living things; all the ions and proteins in a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] are dissolved in water within the cell.\\n\\nMajor uses of solvents are in paints, paint removers, inks, and dry cleaning.<ref>{{Ullmann |doi=10.1002/14356007.a24_437 |title=Solvents|year=2000 |last1=Stoye |first1=Dieter |isbn=3527306730}}</ref> Specific uses for [[Organic compound|organic]] solvents are in [[dry cleaning]] (e.g. [[tetrachloroethylene]]); as [[paint thinner]]s ([[toluene]], [[turpentine]]); as nail polish removers and solvents of glue ([[acetone]], [[methyl acetate]], [[ethyl acetate]]); in spot removers ([[hexane]], petrol ether); in detergents ([[D-limonene|citrus terpenes]]); and in [[perfume]]s ([[ethanol]]). Solvents find various applications in chemical, [[pharmaceutical]], oil, and gas industries, including in [[Chemical synthesis|chemical syntheses]] and purification processes.\\n\\n==Solutions and solvation==\\nWhen one substance is [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] into another, a [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]] is formed.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Tinoco | first1 = Ignacio | last2 = Sauer | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Wang | first3 = James C. | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2002 | title = Physical Chemistry | publisher = Prentice Hall | page = [https://archive.org/details/solutionsmanualp0000unse/page/134 134] | isbn = 978-0-13-026607-1 | url = https://archive.org/details/solutionsmanualp0000unse/page/134 }}</ref> This is opposed to the situation when the compounds are [[insoluble]] like sand in water. In a solution, all of the ingredients are uniformly distributed at a molecular level and no residue remains. A solvent-solute mixture consists of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] with all solute molecules occurring as ''solvates'' (solvent-solute [[Coordination complex|complexes]]), as opposed to separate continuous phases as in suspensions, emulsions and other types of non-solution mixtures. The ability of one compound to be dissolved in another is known as solubility; if this occurs in all proportions, it is called [[miscibility|miscible]].\\n\\nIn addition to mixing, the substances in a solution interact with each other at the molecular level. When something is dissolved, molecules of the solvent arrange around [[molecule]]s of the solute. [[Heat transfer]] is involved and [[entropy]] is increased making the solution more [[thermodynamically stable]] than the solute and solvent separately. This arrangement is mediated by the respective chemical properties of the solvent and solute, such as [[hydrogen bonding]], [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] and [[polarizability]].<ref>Lowery and Richardson, pp. 181\\u2013183</ref> Solvation does not cause a chemical reaction or chemical configuration changes in the solute. However, solvation resembles a [[coordination complex]] formation reaction, often with considerable energetics (heat of solvation and entropy of solvation) and is thus far from a neutral process.\\n\\nWhen one substance dissolves into another, a solution is formed. A solution is a homogeneous mixture consisting of a solute dissolved into a solvent. The solute is the substance that is being dissolved, while the solvent is the dissolving medium. Solutions can be formed with many different types and forms of solutes and solvents.\\n\\n==Solvent classifications==\\nSolvents can be broadly classified into two categories: ''polar'' and ''non-polar''. A special case is elemental [[mercury (element)|mercury]], whose solutions are known as [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams]]; also, other [[liquid metal|metal solutions]] exist which are liquid at room temperature.\\n\\nGenerally, the [[dielectric constant]] of the solvent provides a rough measure of a solvent's polarity. The strong polarity of water is indicated by its high dielectric constant of 88 (at 0&nbsp;\\u00b0C).<ref name=\\\"NIST water\\\">{{cite journal| vauthors = Malmberg CG, Maryott AA |title=Dielectric Constant of Water from 0\\u00b0 to 100&nbsp;\\u00b0C|journal=Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards|date=January 1956|volume=56|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.6028/jres.056.001|doi-access=free}}</ref> Solvents with a dielectric constant of less than 15 are generally considered to be nonpolar.<ref name=p177>Lowery and Richardson, p. 177.</ref>\\n\\nThe dielectric constant measures the solvent's tendency to partly cancel the field strength of the electric field of a [[ion|charged particle]] immersed in it. This reduction is then compared to the [[field strength]] of the charged particle in a vacuum.<ref name=p177/> Heuristically, the dielectric constant of a solvent can be thought of as its ability to reduce the solute's effective [[chemical polarity|internal charge]]. Generally, the dielectric constant of a solvent is an acceptable predictor of the solvent's ability to dissolve common [[ionic compound]]s, such as salts.\\n\\n===Other polarity scales===\\nDielectric constants are not the only measure of polarity. Because solvents are used by chemists to carry out chemical reactions or observe chemical and biological phenomena, more specific measures of polarity are required. Most of these measures are sensitive to chemical structure.\\n\\nThe ''[[Grunwald\\u2013Winstein equation|Grunwald\\u2013Winstein]] m'''Y''' scale'' measures polarity in terms of solvent influence on buildup of positive charge of a solute during a chemical reaction.\\n\\n''[[Edward Kosower|Kosower]]'s '''Z''' scale'' measures polarity in terms of the influence of the solvent on [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-absorption maxima of a salt, usually [[pyridinium]] [[iodide]] or the pyridinium [[zwitterion]].<ref>Kosower, E.M. (1969) \\\"An introduction to Physical Organic Chemistry\\\" Wiley: New York, p. 293</ref>\\n\\n''Donor number and donor acceptor scale'' measures polarity in terms of how a solvent interacts with specific substances, like a strong [[Lewis acid]] or a strong Lewis base.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Gutmann V |journal = Coord. Chem.

It can be used with nonpolar compounds, but cannot accommodate complex chemistry.\\n\\nReichardt's dye, a [[solvatochromic]] dye that changes color in response to polarity, gives a scale of ''E<sub>T</sub>''(30) values. ''E<sub>T</sub>'' is the transition energy between the ground state and the lowest excited state in kcal/mol, and (30) identifies the dye. Another, roughly correlated scale (''E<sub>T</sub>''(33)) can be defined with [[Nile red]].\\n\\n{{anchor|LikeDissolvesLike}}The polarity, dipole moment, polarizability and [[hydrogen bonding]] of a solvent determines what type of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] it is able to dissolve and with what other solvents or liquid compounds it is [[miscible]]. Generally, polar solvents dissolve polar compounds best and non-polar solvents dissolve non-polar compounds best; hence \\\"''like dissolves like''\\\". Strongly polar compounds like [[sugar]]s (e.g. [[sucrose]]) or ionic compounds, like [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s (e.g. [[table salt]]) dissolve only in very polar solvents like water, while strongly non-polar compounds like [[oil]]s or [[wax]]es dissolve only in very non-polar organic solvents like [[hexane]]. Similarly, water and [[hexane]] (or [[vinegar]] and vegetable oil) are not [[miscible]] with each other and will quickly separate into two layers even after being shaken well.\\n\\nPolarity can be separated to different contributions. For example, the '''Kamlet-Taft parameters''' are dipolarity/polarizability (''\\u03c0*''), hydrogen-bonding acidity (''\\u03b1'') and hydrogen-bonding basicity (''\\u03b2''). These can be calculated from the wavelength shifts of 3\\u20136 different solvatochromic dyes in the solvent, usually including [[Reichardt's dye]], [[nitroaniline]] and [[diethylnitroaniline]]. Another option, [[Hansen solubility parameter]]s, separates the cohesive energy density into dispersion, polar, and hydrogen bonding contributions.\\n\\n===Polar protic and polar aprotic===\\nSolvents with a dielectric constant (more accurately, [[relative static permittivity]]) greater than 15 (i.e. polar or polarizable) can be further divided into [[protic]] and aprotic. Protic solvents, such as [[water]], solvate [[anion]]s (negatively charged solutes) strongly via [[hydrogen bonding]]. [[Polar aprotic solvent]]s, such as [[acetone]] or [[dichloromethane]], tend to have large [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moments]] (separation of partial positive and partial negative charges within the same molecule) and solvate positively charged species via their negative dipole.<ref>Lowery and Richardson, p. 183.</ref> In [[chemical reaction]]s the use of polar protic solvents favors the [[SN1 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>1]] [[reaction mechanism]], while polar aprotic solvents favor the [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]] reaction mechanism. These polar solvents are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with water to dissolve in water whereas non-polar solvents are not capable of strong hydrogen bonds.\\n\\n==Physical properties==\\n\\n===Properties table of common solvents===\\nThe solvents are grouped into [[nonpolar]], polar [[aprotic]], and polar [[protic]] solvents, with each group ordered by increasing polarity.

Small amounts of low-boiling-point solvents like [[diethyl ether]], [[dichloromethane]], or acetone will evaporate in seconds at room temperature, while high-boiling-point solvents like water or [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] need higher temperatures, an air flow, or the application of [[vacuum]] for fast evaporation.\\n*Low boilers: boiling point below 100&nbsp;\\u00b0C (boiling point of water)\\n*Medium boilers: between 100&nbsp;\\u00b0C and 150&nbsp;\\u00b0C\\n*High boilers: above 150&nbsp;\\u00b0C\\n\\n===Density===\\nMost organic solvents have a lower [[density]] than water, which means they are lighter than and will form a layer on top of water. Important exceptions are most of the [[halogen]]ated solvents like [[dichloromethane]] or [[chloroform]] will sink to the bottom of a container, leaving water as the top layer. This is crucial to remember when [[partition coefficient|partitioning]] compounds between solvents and water in a [[separatory funnel]] during chemical syntheses.\\n\\nOften, [[specific gravity]] is cited in place of density. Specific gravity is defined as the density of the solvent divided by the density of water at the same temperature. As such, specific gravity is a unitless value. It readily communicates whether a water-insoluble solvent will float (SG < 1.0) or sink (SG > 1.0) when mixed with water.\\n\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\\" style=\\\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\\\"\\n!

The autoignition temperature of carbon disulfide is below 100&nbsp;\\u00b0C (212&nbsp;\\u00b0F), so objects such as [[steam]] pipes, [[light bulb]]s, [[hotplate]]s, and recently extinguished [[bunsen burner]]s are able to ignite its vapors.\\n\\nIn addition some solvents, such as methanol, can burn with a very hot flame which can be nearly invisible under some lighting conditions.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Fanick|first1=E.

THF is normally more likely to form such peroxides than diethyl ether. One of the most susceptible solvents is [[diisopropyl ether]], but all ethers are considered to be potential peroxide sources.\\n\\nThe heteroatom ([[oxygen]]) stabilizes the formation of a [[free radical]] which is formed by the abstraction of a [[hydrogen]] atom by another free radical.{{clarify|date=March 2017}} The carbon-centered free radical thus formed is able to react with an oxygen molecule to form a peroxide compound. The process of peroxide formation is greatly accelerated by exposure to even low levels of light, but can proceed slowly even in dark conditions.\\n\\nUnless a [[desiccant]] is used which can destroy the peroxides, they will concentrate during [[distillation]], due to their higher [[boiling point]]. When sufficient peroxides have formed, they can form a [[crystalline]], shock-sensitive solid [[precipitate]] at the mouth of a container or bottle. Minor mechanical disturbances, such as scraping the inside of a vessel or the dislodging of a deposit, merely twisting the cap may provide sufficient energy for the peroxide to explode or [[detonation|detonate]]. Peroxide formation is not a significant problem when fresh solvents are used up quickly; they are more of a problem in laboratories which may take years to finish a single bottle. Low-volume users should acquire only small amounts of peroxide-prone solvents, and dispose of old solvents on a regular periodic schedule.\\n\\nTo avoid explosive peroxide formation, ethers should be stored in an airtight container, away from light, because both light and air can encourage peroxide formation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaf.edu/safety/industrial-hygiene/laboratory-safety/chem-gas/chemical-hazards/peroxides-ethers/|title=Peroxides and Ethers {{!}} Environmental Health, Safety and Risk Management|website=www.uaf.edu|language=en|access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\\n\\nA number of tests can be used to detect the presence of a peroxide in an ether; one is to use a combination of [[iron(II) sulfate]] and [[potassium thiocyanate]]. The peroxide is able to [[oxidize]] the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion to an Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion, which then forms a deep-red [[coordination complex]] with the [[thiocyanate]].\\n\\nPeroxides may be removed by washing with acidic iron(II) sulfate, filtering through [[alumina]], or [[distillation|distilling]] from [[sodium]]/[[benzophenone]].

Withdrawal from temazepam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]], which resembles symptoms during alcohol and [[barbiturate]] withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur from standard dosages and after short-term use.

Infected leaves may obtain blisters, roughen, or narrow, with blades sticking upwards from the middle of the leaves. The petioles and stems may develop dark green greasy streaks and, in time, become shorter. The ringspots are circular, C-shaped markings that are a darker green than the fruit. In the later stages of the virus, the markings may become gray and crusty. Viral infections impact growth and reduce the fruit's quality. One of the biggest effects that viral infections have on papaya is taste. As of 2010, the only way to protect papaya from this virus is [[Genetically modified food|genetic modification]].<ref name=\\\"papaya ringspot\\\">{{cite web |author1=Gonsalves, D. |author2=Tripathi, S. |author3=Carr, J.B. |author4=Suzuki, J.Y. |year=2010 |title=Papaya ringspot virus |url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=231839}}</ref>\\n\\nThe [[papaya mosaic virus]] destroys the plant until only a small tuft of leaves is left. The virus affects both the leaves of the plant and the fruit. Leaves show thin, irregular, dark-green lines around the borders and clear areas around the veins. The more severely affected leaves are irregular and linear in shape. The virus can infect the fruit at any stage of its maturity. Fruits as young as two weeks old have been spotted with dark-green ringspots about 1 inch (25&nbsp;mm) in diameter. Rings on the fruit are most likely seen on either the stem end or the blossom end. In the early stages of the ringspots, the rings tend to be many closed circles, but as the disease develops, the rings increase in diameter consisting of one large ring. The difference between the ringspot and the mosaic viruses is the ripe fruit in the ringspot has a mottling of colors, and the mosaic does not.<ref name=\\\"papaya mosaic\\\">{{cite web |last1=Hine |first1=B.R. |last2=Holtsmann |first2=O.V. |last3=Raabe |first3=R.D. |date=July 1965 |title=Disease of papaya in Hawaii |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/B-136.pdf}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Fungi and oomycetes ===\\nThe fungus [[anthracnose]] is known to attack papaya, especially mature fruits. The disease starts small with very few signs, such as water-soaked spots on ripening fruits. The spots become sunken, turn brown or black, and may get bigger. In some of the older spots, the fungus may produce pink spores. The fruit ends up being soft and having an off flavor because the fungus grows into the fruit.<ref name=\\\"test\\\">{{cite web |last1=Mossler |first1=M.A. |last2=Crane |first2=J. |date=2008 |title=Florida crop/pest management profile: papaya |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PI/PI05300.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630121711/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/PI/PI05300.pdf |archive-date=30 June 2017 |publisher=University of Florida}}</ref>\\n\\nThe fungus [[powdery mildew]] occurs as a superficial white presence on the leaf's surface, which is easily recognized. Tiny, light yellow spots begin on the lower surfaces of the leaf as the disease starts to make its way. The spots enlarge, and white powdery growth appears on the leaves. The infection usually appears at the upper leaf surface as white fungal growth. Powdery mildew is not as severe as other diseases.<ref name=\\\"powdery mildew\\\">{{cite web |author1=Cunningham, B. |author2=Nelson, S. |date=June 2012 |title=Powdery mildew of papaya in Hawaii |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/PD-90.pdf}}</ref>\\n\\nThe fungus-like oomycete ''[[Phytophthora]]'' causes damping-off, [[root rot]], stem rot, stem girdling, and fruit rot. Damping-off happens in young plants by wilting and death. The spots on established plants start as white, water-soaked lesions at the fruit and branch scars. These spots enlarge and eventually cause death. The disease's most dangerous feature is the fruit's infection, which may be toxic to consumers.<ref name=\\\"test\\\" /> The roots can also be severely and rapidly infected, causing the plant to brown and wilt away, collapsing within days.\\n\\n=== Pests ===\\n\\nThe [[papaya fruit fly]] lays its eggs inside of the fruit, possibly up to 100 or more eggs.<ref name=\\\"morton\\\" /> The eggs usually hatch within 12 days when they begin to feed on seeds and interior parts of the fruit. When the [[larva]]e mature, usually 16 days after being hatched, they eat their way out of the fruit, drop to the ground, and [[pupa]]te in the soil to emerge within one to two weeks later as mature flies. The infected papaya turns yellow and drops to the ground after the papaya fruit fly infestation.<ref name=\\\"test\\\" />\\n\\nThe [[two-spotted spider mite]] is a 0.5-mm-long brown or orange-red or a green, greenish-yellow translucent oval pest. They all have needle-like piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by piercing the plant tissue with their mouthparts, usually on the underside of the plant. The spider mites spin fine threads of webbing on the host plant, and when they remove the sap, the mesophyll tissue collapses, and a small chlorotic spot forms at the feeding sites. The leaves of the papaya fruit turn yellow, gray, or bronze. If the spider mites are not controlled, they can cause the death of the fruit.<ref name=\\\"test\\\" />\\n\\nThe papaya whitefly lays yellow, oval eggs that appear dusted on the undersides of the leaves. They eat papaya leaves, therefore damaging the fruit. There, the eggs developed into flies in three stages called instars. The first instar has well-developed legs and is the only mobile immature life stage. The crawlers insert their mouthparts in the lower surfaces of the leaf when they find it suitable and usually do not move again in this stage. The next instars are flattened, oval, and scale-like. In the final stage, the pupal whiteflies are more convex, with large, conspicuously red eyes.<ref name=\\\"test\\\" />\\n\\nPapayas are one of the most common hosts for fruit flies like [[Anastrepha suspensa|''A. suspensa'']], which lay their eggs in overripe or spoiled papayas. The larvae of these flies then consume the fruit to gain nutrients until they can proceed into the pupal stage. This parasitism has led to extensive economic costs for nations in Central America.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sivinski |first1=J.M. |last2=Calkins |first2=C.O. |last3=Baranowski |first3=R. |last4=Harris |first4=D. |last5=Brambila |first5=J. |last6=Diaz |first6=J. |last7=Burns |first7=R.E. |last8=Holler |first8=T. |last9=Dodson |first9=G. |date=April 1996 |title=Suppression of a Caribbean Fruit Fly (Anastrepha suspensa(Loew) Diptera: Tephritidae) Population through Augmented Releases of the ParasitoidDiachasmimorpha longicaudata(Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) |journal=Biological Control |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=177\\u2013185 |doi=10.1006/bcon.1996.0022 |issn=1049-9644}}</ref>\\n\\n== Cultivation ==\\nHistorical accounts from 18th-century travelers and botanists suggested that papaya seeds were transported from the Caribbean to [[Malacca City|Malacca]] and then to India. From Malacca or the Philippines, papaya spread throughout Asia and into the South Pacific region. Credit for introducing papaya to Hawaii is often given to [[Francisco de Paula Mar\\u00edn]], a Spanish explorer and horticulturist, who brought it from the Marquesas Islands in the early 1800s. Since then, papaya cultivation has expanded to all tropical countries and many subtropical regions worldwide. Today, papaya is grown extensively across the globe, owing to its adaptability to various climates and its popularity as a tropical fruit.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Duarte O |first=Paull RE |title=Tropical Fruits, 1. |date=2010 |publisher=Wallingford : CABI}}</ref>\\n\\nPapaya plants grow in three sexes: male, female, and [[hermaphrodite]].

Doing so seems to cause a similar protective reaction in the plant to ''cross-protection'', which involves using an attenuated virus to protect against a more dangerous strain. Conventional varieties of transgenic papaya has reduced resistance against heterologous (not closely related to the coat gene source) strains, forcing different localities to develop their own transgenic varieties.

The '''double horn in F/B{{music|flat}}''' (technically a variety of [[German horn]]) is the horn most often used by players in professional orchestras and bands, although the '''descant''' and '''triple''' horn have become increasingly popular. A musician who plays a horn is known as a [[list of horn players|horn player]] or hornist.\\n\\nPitch is controlled through the combination of the following factors: speed of air through the instrument (controlled by the player's lungs and [[thoracic diaphragm]]); diameter and tension of lip aperture (by the player's lip muscles\\u2014the [[embouchure]]) in the mouthpiece; plus, in a modern horn, the operation of [[Brass instrument valve|valves]] by the left hand, which route the air into extra sections of tubing. Most horns have lever-operated [[rotary valve]]s, but some, especially older horns, use [[piston valve]]s (similar to a [[trumpet]]'s) and the [[Vienna horn]] uses double-piston valves, or [[Brass instrument valve#Double-piston valve|pumpenvalves]]. The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound in concert situations, in contrast to the more piercing quality of the trumpet. A horn without valves is known as a natural horn, changing pitch along the natural [[harmonics]] of the instrument (similar to a [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]]). Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell, in effect reducing the bell's diameter. The pitch of any note can easily be raised or lowered by adjusting the hand position in the bell.<ref name=\\\"Whitener\\\">{{Cite book |title=A complete guide to brass : instruments and pedagogy |last=Whitener |first=Scott and Cathy L. |publisher=Schirmer Books |year=1990 |isbn=978-0028728612 |location=New York |pages=40, 44 |oclc=19128016}}</ref> The key of a natural horn can be changed by adding different [[Crook (music)|crook]]s of different lengths.\\n\\nThree valves control the flow of air in the ''single horn'', which is tuned to F or less commonly B{{music|flat}}.

However, this is undesirable from the perspective of both endurance and tone: excessive mouthpiece pressure makes the horn sound forced and harsh and decreases the player's stamina due to the resulting constricted flow of blood to the lips and lip muscles. Added pressure from the lips to the mouthpiece can also result in tension in the face resulting in what brass players often call \\\"pushing\\\".

Since the only notes available were those on the harmonic series of one of those pitches, horn-players had no ability to play in different keys. The remedy for this limitation was the use of [[Crook (music) |crooks]], i.e., sections of tubing of differing length that, when inserted, altered the length of the instrument, and thus its pitch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://omeka1.grinnell.edu/MusicalInstruments/items/show/193|title=Grinell College Musical|access-date=2019-01-10|archive-date=2015-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926081238/http://omeka1.grinnell.edu/MusicalInstruments/items/show/193|url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\nIn the mid-18th century, horn players began to insert the right hand into the bell to change the length of the instrument, adjusting the tuning up to the distance between two adjacent harmonics depending on how much of the opening was covered.\\n\\nIn 1818 the German makers [[Heinrich St\\u00f6lzel]] and Friedrich Bl\\u00fcmel patented the first valved horn, using rotary valves.

Valves' unreliability, musical taste, and players' distrust, among other reasons, slowed their adoption into the mainstream. Many traditional conservatories and players refused to use them at first, claiming that the valveless horn, or ''natural horn'', was a better instrument. Some musicians who specialize in period instruments use a natural horn to play in original performance styles, to try to recapture the sound of an older piece's original performances.<ref>See, e.g., the performance of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Mass in B Minor]]'' as performed by the [[The Proms| Proms]] of London in the movement from 45:40 onward in {{cite web\\n|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F7TVM8m95Y\\n|title = Mass in B Minor\\n|magazine = You Tube\\n|date = 2012\\n|access-date = 2013-11-29\\n}}\\n</ref>\\n\\nThe use of [[brass instrument valve| valve]]s, however, opened up a great deal more flexibility for playing in different keys; in effect, the horn became an entirely different instrument, fully [[chromatic]] for the first time. Valves were originally used primarily as a means to play in different keys without crooks, not for harmonic playing. That is reflected in compositions for horns, which only began to include chromatic passages in the late-19th century.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018|reason=The extremely high horn playing from the baroque and early classical periods would allow the horn to play almost completely chromatically due to the tiny differences in harmonics. This may have caused the name to develop as nobody was to know then that true chromaticism would happen in the next century. Examples include anything in a high register from that period, e.g. the horn solo from Bach's B-Minor Mass}}<!--If this is true, then what was the \\\"corno chromatico\\\" of the late 18th century, and why was it so called?--> There were many different versions of early valves, most being variants of the piston and rotary systems used in modern horns. Early valves by Bl\\u00fchmel are cited as possibly the first rotary valve, but the first confirmed rotary valve design was in 1832 by Joseph Riedl in Vienna. {{Clarify|reason=Barry Tuckwell goes into a lot of detail about certain valve systems in his book.

This allows for simplicity of use and a much lighter weight. They are usually in the keys of F or B{{music|flat}}, although many F horns have longer slides to tune them to E{{music|flat}}, and almost all B{{music|flat}} horns have a valve to put them in the key of A. The problem with single horns is the inevitable choice between accuracy or tone \\u2013 while the F horn has the \\\"typical\\\" horn sound, above third-space C accuracy is a concern for the majority of players because, by its nature, one plays high in the horn's harmonic series where the overtones are closer together. This led to the development of the B{{music|flat}} horn, which, although easier to play accurately, has a less desirable sound in the mid and especially the low register where it is not able to play all of the notes. The solution has been the development of the double horn, which combines the two into one horn with a single lead pipe and bell. Both main types of single horns are still used today as student models because they are cheaper and lighter than double horns. In addition, the single B{{music|flat}} horns are sometimes used in solo and chamber performances and the single F survives orchestrally as the Vienna horn. Additionally, single F alto and B{{music|flat}} alto descants are used in the performance of some baroque horn concertos and F, B{{music|flat}} and F alto singles are occasionally used by [[jazz]] performers.\\n\\n[[Dennis Brain]]'s benchmark recordings of the Mozart Horn Concerti were made on a single B{{music|flat}} instrument by [[Gebr. Alexander]], now on display at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.\\n\\n===Double horn===\\n[[File:French horn detail.jpg|thumb|The [[rotary valve|valves]] of a [[Conn-Selmer|Conn]] 6D double horn. The three lever keys (above the large valves) can be depressed toward the large outer tube. The thumb key (''near the left-most valve'') moves inward toward the three finger keys.]]\\n[[File:French Horn back.svg|thumb|Scheme of a double horn (''view from underneath'')\\n{{ordered list\\n| [[Mouthpiece (brass)|Mouthpiece]]\\n| [[Leadpipe]], where the mouthpiece is placed\\n| Adjustable handrest\\n| [[Water key]] (also called a spit valve)\\n| Fourth valve to change between F and B{{music|flat}} pitches\\n| Valve levers, operated with the left hand\\n| [[Brass instrument valve#Rotary valve|Rotary valves]]\\n| [[Slide (wind instrument)|Slides]], for tuning each valve\\n| Long tubing for F pitch with slide\\n| General slide\\n| Short tubing for B{{music|flat}} pitch with slide\\n| Bellpipe\\n| [[Bell (wind instrument)|Bell]]; the right hand is cupped inside this\\n}}]]\\nDespite the introduction of valves, the single F horn proved difficult for use in the highest range, where the partials grew closer and closer, making accuracy a great challenge. An early solution was simply to use a horn of higher pitch\\u2014usually B{{music|flat}}. The use of the F versus the B{{music|flat}} horn was extensively debated among horn players of the late 19th century, until the German horn maker [[Ed. Kruspe|Eduard Kruspe]] (namesake of his family's brass instrument firm) produced a prototype of the \\\"double horn\\\" in 1897.\\n\\nThe double horn also combines two instruments into a single frame: the original horn in F, and a second, higher horn keyed in B{{music|flat}}. By using a fourth valve (usually operated by the thumb), the horn player can quickly switch from the deep, warm tones of the F horn to the higher, brighter tones of the B{{music|flat}} horn, or vice versa, as the horn player may choose to have the horn set into B{{music|flat}} by default by making a simple adjustment to the valves. The two sets of tones are commonly called \\\"sides\\\" of the horn. Using the fourth valve not only changes the basic length (and thus the harmonic series and pitch) of the instrument, it also causes the three main valves to use proportionate slide lengths.<ref>Backus, John, ''The Acoustical Foundations of Music'', 2nd ed. (New York: W. W. Norton, 1977),{{Page needed|date=June 2015}} {{ISBN|0-393-09096-5}}.</ref>\\n\\nIn the US, the two most common styles (\\\"wraps\\\") of double horns are named Kruspe and Geyer/Knopf, after the first instrument makers who developed and standardized them. The Kruspe wrap locates the B{{music|flat}} change valve above the first valve, near the thumb. The Geyer wrap has the change valve behind the third valve, near the little finger (although the valve's trigger is still played with the thumb). In effect, the air flows in a completely different direction on the other model. Kruspe wrap horns tend to be larger in the bell throat than the Geyer wrap horns. Traditionally, Kruspe models are constructed from [[nickel silver]] (also called German silver, an alloy of copper, nickel and zinc, containing no actual silver) while Geyer horns tend to be of yellow brass; although these differences in finish aren't as prevalent today - horns of both finishes can be found in either wrap. Both models have their own strengths and weaknesses, and while the choice of instrument is very personal, an orchestral horn section is usually found to have either one or the other, owing to the differences in tone color, response, and projection of the two different styles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\\n\\nIn Europe the most popular horns are arguably those made by Gebr. Alexander, of Mainz (particularly the Alexander 103), and those made by [[Paxman Musical Instruments|Paxman]] in London. In Germany and the [[Benelux]] countries, the Alex 103 is extremely popular. These horns do not fit strictly into the Kruspe or Knopf camps, but have features of both. Alexander prefers the traditional medium bell size, which they have produced for many years, whereas Paxman do offer their models in a range of bell throat sizes. In the United States, the [[Conn-Selmer|Conn]] 8D, a mass-produced instrument based on the Kruspe design, has been extremely popular in many areas (New York, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Philadelphia). Since roughly the early 1990s, however, for reasons ranging from changing tastes to a general dislike of Conn's newer 8Ds, orchestras have been moving away from the popular Conn 8D. Geyer model horns (by Carl Geyer, Karl Hill, Keith Berg, Steve Lewis, Jerry Lechniuk, [[Daniel Rauch|Dan Rauch]], and Ricco-Kuhn) are used in other areas (San Francisco, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, Houston). The CF Schmidt double, with its unique piston change valve, is occasionally found in sections playing Geyer/Knopf model equipment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\\n\\n===Compensating double horn===\\nA full double horn has two full-length sets of slides (one set for the B{{music|flat}} side and a longer set for the F side); a compensating double horn only has full-length slides for the B{{music|flat}} side and a shorter set of slides whose length can be added to the B{{music|flat}} slides to give the necessary tubing length for playing in F. As for the full double horn, the air is routed through the appropriate slide(s) by use of the fourth valve. Compensating double horns are lighter than full double horns because of this design.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ericson |first1=John |title=What is a Compensating Double?|url= https://www.hornmatters.com/2008/12/what-is-a-compensating-double/ |language=English }}</ref>\\n\\n===Triple horn===\\nA triple horn has more tubing, adding a descant horn to the double horn and hence giving more assistance for the high range. The descant horn is most commonly in F, sounding an octave higher than the normal F horn.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ericson |first1=John |title=Playing Descant and Triple Horns|url= https://www.public.asu.edu/~jqerics/descant-triple.html |language=English }}</ref>\\n\\n===Detachable bell===\\nThe horn, although not large, is awkward in its shape and does not lend itself well to transport where space is shared or limited, especially on planes. To compensate, horn makers can make the bell detachable; this allows for smaller and more manageable horn cases.\\n\\n==Related horns==\\n{{Main|Horn (instrument)}}\\nThe variety in horn history necessitates consideration of the natural horn, Vienna horn, mellophone, marching horn, and Wagner tuba.\\n\\n===Natural horn===\\n[[File:Natural Horn (instrument).JPG|left|thumb|A natural horn has no valves, but can be tuned to a different key by inserting different tubing, as during a rest period.]]\\n{{Main|Natural horn}}\\nThe [[natural horn]] is the ancestor of the modern horn. It is essentially descended from hunting horns, with its pitch controlled by air speed, aperture (opening of the lips through which air passes) and the use of the right hand moving around, as well as in and out of the bell. Although a few recent composers have written specifically for the natural horn (e.g., [[Gy\\u00f6rgy Ligeti]]'s ''[[Hamburg Concerto]]''), today it is played primarily as a [[Historically informed performance|period instrument]]. The natural horn can only play from a single harmonic series at a time because there is only one length of tubing available to the horn player. A proficient player can indeed alter the pitch by partially muting the bell with the right hand, thus enabling the player to reach some notes that are not part of the instrument's natural harmonic series \\u2013 of course this technique also affects the quality of the tone. The player has a choice of key by using crooks to change the length of tubing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Musical instruments of the world|last=Diagram Group.|date=1976|publisher=Published for Unicef by Facts On File|isbn=0871963205|pages=68|oclc=223164947}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2019}}<!--It seems unlikely that a book of this nature would mention everything in this paragraph (especially Ligeti's use of the instrument).-->\\n\\n===Vienna horn===\\n[[File:Viennese horn.jpg|thumb|Vienna horn]]\\n{{Main|Vienna horn}}\\nThe [[Vienna horn]] is a special horn used primarily in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Instead of using [[rotary valve]]s or [[piston valve]]s, it uses the pumpenvalve (or Vienna valve), which is a double-piston operating inside the valve slides, and usually situated on the opposite side of the corpus from the player's left hand, and operated by a long pushrod. Unlike the modern horn, which has grown considerably larger internally (for a bigger, broader, and louder tone), and considerably heavier (with the addition of valves and tubing in the case of the double horn) the Vienna horn very closely mimics the size and weight of the natural horn, (although the valves do add some weight, they are lighter than rotary valves) even using crooks in the front of the horn, between the mouthpiece and the instrument. Although instead of the full range of keys, Vienna horn players usually use an F crook and it is looked down upon to use others, though switching to an A or B{{music|flat}} crook for higher pitched music does happen on occasion. Vienna horns are often used with funnel shaped mouthpieces similar to those used on the natural horn, with very little (if any) backbore and a very thin rim. The Viennese horn requires very specialized technique and can be quite challenging to play, even for accomplished players of modern horns. The Vienna horn has a warmer, softer sound than the modern horn. Its pumpenvalves facilitate a continuous transition between notes ([[glissando]]); conversely, a more precise operating of the valves is required to avoid notes that sound out of tune.\\n\\n===Mellophone===\\n{{Main|Mellophone}}\\nTwo instruments are called a ''mellophone''. The first is an instrument shaped somewhat like a horn, in that it is formed in a circle and is often referred to as a \\\"classic\\\" or \\\"concert\\\" mellophone. It has piston valves and is played with the right hand on the valves. Most are pitched in the key of F, with facility to switch to E{{music|flat}}, either by changing crooks/leadpipes, or by a valve dedicated to this purpose. Older examples often included the ability to be played in the keys of D and/or C as well. Manufacturing of this instrument sharply decreased in the middle of the 20th century, and this mellophone (or mellophonium) rarely appears today.\\n\\nThe second instrument is used in modern brass bands and marching bands, and is more accurately called a \\\"marching mellophone\\\". A derivative of the F [[alto horn]], it is keyed in F. It is shaped like a flugelhorn, with piston valves played with the right hand and a forward-pointing bell. These horns are generally considered better [[marching instrument]]s than regular horns because their position is more stable on the mouth, they project better, and they weigh less. It is primarily used as the middle voice of [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]]. Though they are usually played with a V-cup cornet-like mouthpiece, their range overlaps the common playing range of the horn. This mouthpiece switch makes the mellophone louder, less mellow, and more brassy and brilliant, making it more appropriate for marching bands. Often now with the use of converters, traditional conical horn mouthpieces are used to achieve the more mellow sound of a horn to make the marching band sound more like a concert band.\\n\\nAs they are pitched in F or G and their range overlaps that of the horn, mellophones can be used in place of the horn in brass and marching band settings. Mellophones are, however, sometimes unpopular with horn players because the mouthpiece change can be difficult and requires a different [[embouchure]]. Mouthpiece adapters are available so that a horn mouthpiece can fit into the mellophone lead pipe (some of them are designed to where the end is bent at a 45 degree angle so that they can use the same embouchure), but this does not compensate for the many differences that a horn player must adapt to. The \\\"feel\\\" of the mellophone can be foreign to a horn player. Another unfamiliar aspect of the mellophone is that it is designed to be played with the right hand instead of the left (though it can be played with the left). Intonation can also be an issue with the mellophone.{{Why|date=July 2016}}\\n\\nWhile horn players may be asked to play the mellophone, it is unlikely that the instrument was ever intended as a substitute for the horn, mainly because of the fundamental differences described.<ref>{{cite web | title= The History of the Mellophone | url= http://www.alsmiddlebrasspages.com/mellophone/history.html | last= Monks | first= Greg | date= 2006-01-06 | publisher= Al's Mellophone Page | access-date= 2008-07-29}}</ref> As an instrument it compromises between the ability to sound like a horn, while being used like a trumpet or flugelhorn, a tradeoff that sacrifices acoustic properties for ergonomics.\\n\\n===Marching horn===\\nThe marching horn is quite similar to the mellophone in shape and appearance, but is pitched in the key of B{{music|flat}}, the same as the B{{music|flat}} side of a double horn or [[Valve trombone]] (which is also the same as a [[Bass Trumpet]], an Octave below a Normal Trumpet). It is also available in F alto, one octave above the F side of a double horn (or the High F Side of a Triple Horn). The marching horn is also played with a horn mouthpiece (unlike the mellophone, which needs an adapter to fit the horn mouthpiece). These instruments are primarily used in marching bands so the sound comes from a forward-facing bell, as dissipation of the sound from the backward-facing bell becomes a concern in open-air environments. Many college marching bands and drum corps, however, use mellophones instead, which, with many marching bands, better balance the tone of the other brass instruments; additionally, mellophones require less special training of trumpeters, who considerably outnumber horn players.<ref>Mellophones, as indicated, use the same fingering as trumpets and are operated by the right hand.</ref> Some College Marching Bands use Marching French Horns when accompanying Choirs as to not overpower their Singing.\\n\\n===Wagner tuba===\\n{{Main|Wagner tuba}}\\nThe Wagner tuba is a rare brass instrument that is essentially a horn modified to have a larger bell throat and a vertical bell. Despite its name and its somewhat tuba-shaped appearance, it is generally not considered part of the [[tuba]] family, because the instrument's relatively narrow bore causes it to play more like a horn. Invented for [[Richard Wagner]] specifically for his work ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', it has since been written for by various other composers, including [[Bruckner]], [[Stravinsky]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. It uses a horn mouthpiece and is available as a single tuba in B{{music|flat}} or F, or, more recently, as a double tuba similar to the double horn. It is usually played in a range similar to that of the [[euphonium]], but its possible range is the same as that of the horn, extending from low F{{music|sharp}}, below the bass clef staff to high C above the treble staff when read in F. The low pedal tones are substantially easier to play on the Wagner tuba than on the horn. Wagner viewed the regular horn as a woodwind rather than a brass instrument, evidenced by his placing of the horn parts in his orchestral scores in the woodwind group and not in their usual place above the trumpets in the brass section.\\n\\n==Repertoire==\\n{{See also|List of compositions for horn}}\\n[[File:Paxman-horns.jpg|thumb|left|Paxman horns]]\\nDiscussion of the repertoire of horns must recognize the different needs of orchestras and concert bands in contrast to marching bands, as above, but also the use of horns in a wide variety of music, including chamber music and jazz.\\n\\n===Orchestra and concert band===\\nThe horn is most often used as an orchestral and concert band instrument, with its singular tone being employed by composers to achieve specific effects. [[Leopold Mozart]], for example, used horns to signify the hunt, as in his ''[[Jagdsinfonie]]'' (hunting symphony). [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] wrote much for the horn, and it features prominently in the work of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''Brandenburg Concerto no. 1''. Once the technique of [[hand-stopping]] had been developed, allowing fully chromatic playing, composers began to write seriously for the horn. [[Gustav Mahler]] made great use of the horn's uniquely haunting and distant sound in his symphonies, notably the famous ''Nachtmusik'' (serenade) section of his [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 7]].\\n\\nMany composers have written works that have become favorites in the horn repertoire. These include [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] (''Elegie'') and [[Camille Saint-Sa\\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\\u00ebns]] (''Morceau de Concert for horn and orchestra'', op. 94 and ''Romance'', op. 36). Others, particularly [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], whose friend [[Joseph Leutgeb]] was a noted horn player, wrote extensively for the instrument, including [[concerto|concerti]] and other solo works. Mozart's ''[[A Musical Joke]]'' satirizes the limitations of contemporary horn playing, including the risk of selecting the wrong crook by mistake.\\n\\nThe development of the valve horn was exploited by romantic composers such as [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], [[Mahler]], and [[Richard Strauss]], whose father was a well-known professional horn player. Strauss's ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' contains one of the best known horn solos from this period, relying on the chromatic facility of the valved horn. [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''Konzertst\\u00fcck'' for four horns and orchestra is a notable three-movement work. Brahms had a lifelong love-affair with the instrument, with many prominently featured parts throughout his four symphonies. Despite his use of natural horns in his work (e.g., Horns in B\\u266e in the second movement of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 2]]), players today typically play Brahms's music on modern valved instruments.\\n\\n===Chamber music===\\nThere is an abundance of chamber music repertoire for horn. It is a standard member of the [[wind quintet]] and [[brass quintet]], and often appears in other configurations, such as Brahms' [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|Horn Trio]] for violin, horn and piano (for which, however, Brahms specified the natural horn). Also, the horn can be used by itself in a horn ensemble or \\\"horn choir\\\". The horn choir is especially practical because the extended range of the horn provides the composer or arranger with more possibilities, registerally, sonically, and contrapuntally.\\n\\n==Orchestral and concert band horns==\\n[[File:DSC 8763 (7084102945).jpg|thumb|A horn section in a military [[concert band]]]]\\n[[File:I Solisti Veneti, concerto La tromba, regina degli ottoni 27 sett 2022 (Chesa della Rotonda, Rovigo) 03.jpg|thumb|left|The horn section in [[I Solisti Veneti]], a chamber Baroque orchestra]]\\nA classical orchestra usually has at least two French horn players. Typically, the first horn played a high part and the second horn played a low part. Composers from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (early 1800s) onwards commonly used four horns. Here, the first and second horns played as a pair (first horn being high, second horn being low), and the third and fourth horns played as another pair (third horn being high, fourth horn being low).\\n\\nMusic written for the modern horn follows a similar pattern with the first and third horns being high and the second and fourth horns being low. This configuration serves multiple purposes. It is easier to play high when the adjacent player is playing low and vice versa. Pairing makes it easier to write for horns, as the third and fourth horns can take over from the first and second horns or play contrasting material. For example, if the piece is in C minor, the first and second horns might be in C, the tonic major key, which could get most of the notes, and the third and fourth horns might be in E{{music|flat}}, the relative major key, to fill in the gaps.\\n\\nMany orchestral horn sections in the 2010s also have an assistant<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ericson |first1=John |title=Horn Sections with and Without an associate principal |url=http://hornmatters.com/2010/03/horn-sections-with-and-without-an-associate-principal/ |access-date=14 January 2012 |date=28 March 2010|language=English }}</ref> who doubles the first horn part for selected passages, joining in loud parts, playing instead of the principal if there is a first horn solo approaching, or alternating with the principal if the part is tiring to play.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bacon |first1=Thomas |title=The Horn Section |url=http://www.hornplanet.com/hornpage/museum/articles/associate.html |access-date=14 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081850/http://www.hornplanet.com/hornpage/museum/articles/associate.html |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |language=English |url-status=live}}</ref> Often the assistant is asked to play a passage after resting a long time. Also, he or she may be asked to enter in the middle of a passage, exactly matching the sound, articulation, and overall interpretation of the principal, thus enabling the principal horn to rest a bit.\\n\\n==In jazz==\\n{{See also|Category:Jazz horn players|French horn in jazz}}\\nThe French horn was at first rarely used in [[jazz]] music. (Note that colloquially in jazz, the word \\\"horn\\\" refers to any wind instrument.) Notable exponents, however, began including French horn in jazz pieces and ensembles. These include composer/arranger [[Gil Evans]] who included the French horn as an ensemble instrument from the 1940s, first in [[Claude Thornhill]]'s groups, and later with the pioneering [[cool jazz]] nonet (nine-piece group) led by trumpeter [[Miles Davis]], and in many other projects that sometimes also featured Davis, as well as [[Don Ellis]], a trumpet player from [[Stan Kenton]]'s jazz band. Notable works of Ellis' jazz French horn include \\\"Strawberry Soup\\\" and other songs on the album ''[[Tears of Joy (album)|Tears of Joy]]''. Notable improvising horn players in jazz include [[Julius Watkins]], [[Willie Ruff]], [[John Graas]], [[David Amram]], [[John Clark (musician)|John Clark]], [[Vincent Chancey]], Giovanni Hoffer, [[Arkady Shilkloper]], Adam Unsworth, and [[Tom Varner]].\\n\\n==Notable horn players==\\n{{See also|List of horn players}}\\n<!-- We do not need any more examples on this page.

A former ''[[apocrisiarius]]'' to [[Constantinople]], Pelagius I was elected [[pope]] as the candidate of Emperor [[Justinian I]], a designation not well received in the [[Western Church]]. Before his papacy, he opposed Justinian's efforts to condemn the \\\"[[Three Chapters]]\\\" in order to reconcile theological factions within the Church, but later adopted Justinian's position.\\n\\n==Family and early career==\\nPelagius was born into a noble family from [[Rome]].  His father, John, seems to have been vicar of one of the two civil districts into which Italy was then divided.<ref name=\\\"ce-pelagius\\\">{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope Pelagius I|volume=11|author=Mann, Horace K.}}</ref>\\n\\nPelagius accompanied [[Pope Agapetus I]] to [[Constantinople]] and was appointed ''[[papal apocrisiarius|apocrisiarius]]''. As such, Pelagius acquired great influence with Emperor [[Justinian I]]. He returned to Rome in 543.<ref name=\\\"ce-pelagius\\\"/> In 545, when [[Pope Vigilius]] went to Constantinople on Justinian's orders, Pelagius stayed in Rome as the pope's representative. [[Totila]], king of the [[Goths]], had begun to blockade the city.  Pelagius poured out his own fortune for the benefit of the famine-stricken people, and tried to induce the king to grant a truce.  Though he failed, he afterwards induced Totila to spare the lives of the people when he captured Rome in December 546.  Totila sent Pelagius to Constantinople in order to arrange a peace with Justinian I, but the emperor sent him back to say that his general [[Belisarius]] was in command in Italy.<ref name=\\\"ce-pelagius\\\"/>\\n\\n==Papacy==\\n[[Pope Vigilius|Vigilius]] died on 7 June 555, and Pelagius was [[papal selection before 1059|elected]] to succeed him as [[pope]]. Pelagius was the [[Byzantine papacy|emperor's candidate]], a designation not well received by the Western clergy and laity.<ref name=Brusher>[http://www.spirituality.org/is/193/pope_60.asp Brusher, Joseph S., ''Popes Through the Ages''], 1980, San Rafael, California, Neff-Kane, {{ISBN|978-0-89-141110-9}}</ref> While before his ordination he opposed Justinian's efforts to condemn the \\\"[[schism of the Three Chapters|Three Chapters]]\\\" in order to reconcile theological factions in the Church, afterwards Pelagius adopted Justinian's position.\\n\\nPelagius I's pontificate was undermined by rumors that he might have somehow been complicit in the death of Vigilius, and suspicion that his conceding to Justinian indicating a support for [[monophysitism]]. To overcome this he worked to maintain public order in Rome, and correct abuses among the clergy. He also labored on behalf of the poor and the victims of famine and war. In response to a request from the garrison commander at Civitavecchia, Pelagius directed Bishop Lawrence of that town, to provide chaplains for the army.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dw_RnDP6V9UC&dq=Pope+Pelagius+I&pg=PA17 Bachrach, David Steward.

Merchants from Japan and China would often visit the area to trade gold for beads, ceramics and silk. The [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] inhabitants of the region called their place ''samtoy'', from ''sao mi toy'', which literally meant \\\"our language\\\".{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}\\n\\n=== Spanish colonial era ===\\nIn 1571, the Spanish conquistadors had Manila under their control and they began looking for new sites to conquer. [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]]'s grandson [[Juan de Salcedo]] volunteered to lead one of these expeditions. Together with 8 armed boats and 45 men the 22-year-old voyager headed north.  On June 13, 1572, Salcedo and his men landed in present-day [[Vigan]] then proceeded to [[Laoag]], [[Currimao]] and [[Badoc]]. As they sailed along the coast they were surprised to see numerous sheltered coves (''looc'') where the locals lived in harmony. They named the region ''Ylocos'' and its people ''Ylocanos''.\\n\\nAs the Christianization of the region grew so did the landscape of the area. Vast tracts of land were utilized for churches and bell towers in line with the Spanish mission of ''bajo las campanas''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2023|reason=This term exists in many places, but what it means is not defined in source.}} In the [[town plaza]] it was not uncommon to see garrisons under the church bells.  Indigenous peoples living in the Ilocos Region, such as the Yapayao and Isneg, were slowly pushed into living in the sparsely populated but resource-rich mountains, which would expose them to conflicts with developers in later eras, such as during [[Martial Law under Ferdinand Marcos]].<ref name=\\\"Pawilen2021SolidNorthMyth\\\">{{Cite web |last=Pawilen |first=Reidan M. |date=May 2021 |title=The Solid North myth: an Investigation on the status of dissent and human rights during the Marcos Regime in Regions 1 and 2, 1969-1986 |url=https://www.ukdr.uplb.edu.ph/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&context=journal-articles |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211113132016/https://www.ukdr.uplb.edu.ph/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&context=journal-articles |archive-date=November 13, 2021 |access-date=May 22, 2022 |website=University of the Philippines Los Ba\\u00f1os University Knowledge Digital Repository}}</ref>{{rp|page=47}}\\n\\nSpanish colonization of the region was not completely successful. Owing to the abusive practices of many [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[friar]]s a number of Ilocanos revolted. Noteworthy of these were the Dingras uprising (1589) and the Pedro Almasan revolt (San Nicolas, 1660). In 1762, [[Diego Silang]] led a series of battles aimed at freeing the Ilocano. When he died from his friendly fire his widow [[Gabriela Silang|Gabriela]] continued his cause. She too was captured and executed.\\n\\nIn 1807 the sugar cane (''basi'') brewers of [[Piddig]] rose up in arms to protest the government's [[monopoly]] of the wine industry. In 1898, the church excommunicated [[Gregorio Aglipay]] for refusing to cut off ties with the revolutionary forces of Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. Unperturbed, he helped established the ''[[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]]''.\\n\\nIn an effort to gain political control and because of the increasing population of the region, a Royal Decree was signed on February 2, 1818, splitting Ilocos into two provinces: Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur. Soon thereafter, [[La Union]] and [[Abra (province)|Abra]] became independent provinces.\\n\\n=== Japanese occupation era ===\\nAfter the fall of Corregidor and the subsequent occupation of the Philippines by the Empire of Japan, a number of small guerilla groups formed in the area of Ilocos Norte, some of which resorted to banditry.<ref name=\\\"AgoncilloFateful\\\"/> Governor Roque Ablan Sr., with the help of Philippine Army Lt.

It originated as an intermittent serial in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in 1888\\u201389 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The ''Diary'' records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, [[Charles Pooter]], his wife Carrie, his son William Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months.\\n\\nBefore their collaboration on the ''Diary'', the brothers each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated nine of the principal comedian roles in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano [[sketch comedy|sketch]] entertainer and wrote a large number of songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The ''Diary'' was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the ''Diary'' were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.\\n\\nAlthough its initial public reception was muted, the ''Diary'' came to be recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and it has never been out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or lower-middle class aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The ''Diary'' has been the subject of several stage and screen adaptations, including [[Ken Russell]]'s \\\"silent film\\\" treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts.\\n\\n==Authorship and origin==\\n[[File:Weedon-and-George-Grossmith.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Grossmith|George]] (right) and [[Weedon Grossmith]]|alt=Two men in suits. There is a family resemblance.]]\\n''The Diary of a Nobody'' was the work of [[George Grossmith]] and his brother [[Weedon Grossmith]], the sons of a court reporter and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the [[West London School of Art]] and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor.<ref name= JH/> The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at [[Haverstock|Haverstock Hill]]. This included a 20-minute [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] version of ''[[Hamlet]]'', in which George played the title role; Weedon was [[Ophelia]].<ref>{{cite web|last= Grossmith|first= George|title= A Society Clown: Reminiscences.

In a short prologue, readers are informed that [[Charles Pooter]] and his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at \\\"The Laurels\\\", Brickfield Terrace, [[Holloway, London|Holloway]]. Mr Pooter is a [[City of London]] clerk with Perkupp's, possibly an [[Accountant|accountancy]] or private banking firm (though their business is not explicitly stated). The couple's 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk in [[Oldham]]. The first entries describe the Pooters' daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses from [[Sutton, London|Sutton]]. From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters' daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter's unconscious self-importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations.\\n\\nThe rare formal social events in the Pooters' lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from the [[Lord Mayor of London]] to attend a ball at the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] for \\\"Representatives of Trade and Commerce\\\". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished. Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.\\n\\nIn the summer their son arrives from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, \\\"Lupin\\\". He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupp's. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week in [[Broadstairs]], but relationships are strained by Lupin's \\\"fast\\\" habits. On their return, Pooter's efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the \\\"Holloway Comedians\\\". With the help of Pooter's employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement.\\n[[File:Daisy-mutlar.gif|thumb|left|upright |Daisy Mutlar|alt=A drawing of a young woman in a dark dress and a bonnet]]\\nLupin's fianc\\u00e9e, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, \\\"the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met\\\".   Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: \\\"She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking\\\". Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.\\n\\nIn the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to \\\"The Laurels\\\". These occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if by right. Lupin opts out of the family's Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone's astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy.\\n\\nIn the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by \\u00a3100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement that he has just profited by \\u00a3200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest \\u00a3600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.\\n\\nApril begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests\\u2014among them Mr Padge\\u2014with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle, who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.\\n\\nLupin is sacked from Perkupp's for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillon, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with a \\u00a325 commission and a job at \\u00a3200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh.   Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray's sister, known as \\\"Lillie Girl\\\", a woman of around 30. Pooter learns that Murray Posh has settled \\u00a310,000 on both Daisy and \\\"Lillie Girl\\\".\\n\\nPooter is summoned to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupp's a new client to replace Mr Crowbillon. Perkupp is so grateful to Pooter for this introduction that he buys up the freehold of \\\"The Laurels\\\" and presents the [[deed]]s to Pooter. As the couple celebrate, a letter arrives from Lupin announcing his engagement to \\\"Lillie Girl\\\": \\\"We shall be married in August, and among our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing and Cummings\\\".\\n\\n==Publication and reception history==\\n[[File:Punch 1888 May 26 page 1.jpg|thumb|right|295px|The first instalment in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (1888)]] \\nThe ''Diary'' made its initial appearance as an intermittent serial in the satirical weekly magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.<ref name= Morton/> The first of the 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: \\\"As everybody who is anybody is publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to 'A Nobody' for permitting us to add to the historic collection\\\".<ref>{{cite journal|title= The Diary of a Nobody|url= https://archive.org/stream/punchvol94a95lemouoft#page/n271/mode/2up|journal= Punch, or the London Charivari|volume= 94|date= 26 May 1888|page= 241}}</ref> The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear in ''Punch''.<ref>Hammerton, p. 291</ref>\\nThe ''Punch'' serialisation ended in May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their friends celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupp's.<ref>{{cite journal|title= The Diary of a Nobody|url= https://archive.org/stream/punchvol96a97lemouoft#page/n261/mode/2up|journal= Punch, or the London Charivari|volume= 96|date= 11 May 1889|page= 229}}</ref> That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.<ref name= Morton/>\\n\\nIn June 1892 [[J.W.

In the works of writers such as [[George Gissing]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[E. M. Forster]], characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as \\\"[[The Card|Denry Machin]]\\\", \\\"[[The History of Mr Polly|Mr Polly]]\\\" or \\\"[[Love and Mr Lewisham|Mr Lewisham]]\\\", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things.

He was the fourth son of [[William the Conqueror]] and was educated in [[Latin]] and the [[liberal arts]]. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder brothers [[Robert Curthose]] and [[William Rufus]] inherited [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and England, respectively, but Henry was left landless. He purchased the County of [[Cotentin]] in western Normandy from Robert, but his brothers deposed him in 1091. He gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William Rufus against Robert.\\n\\nPresent in England with his brother William, who died in a hunting accident, Henry seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. He married [[Matilda of Scotland]] and they had two surviving children, [[Empress Matilda]] and [[William Adelin]]; he also had many illegitimate children by his numerous mistresses. Robert, who invaded from Normandy in 1101, disputed Henry's control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. The peace was short-lived, and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106, finally defeating Robert at the [[Battle of Tinchebray]]. Henry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry's control of Normandy was challenged by [[Louis VI of France]], [[Baldwin VII of Flanders]] and [[Fulk V of Anjou]], who promoted the rival claims of Robert's son, [[William Clito]], and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119. Following Henry's victory at the [[Battle of Br\\u00e9mule]], a favourable peace settlement was agreed with Louis in 1120.\\n\\nConsidered by contemporaries to be a harsh but effective ruler, Henry skilfully manipulated the barons in England and Normandy. In England, he drew on the existing [[Anglo-Saxon]] system of justice, local government and taxation, but also strengthened it with more institutions, including the royal [[exchequer]] and itinerant [[justices]]. Normandy was also governed through a growing system of justices and an exchequer. Many of the officials who ran Henry's system were \\\"new men\\\" of obscure backgrounds, rather than from families of high status, who rose through the ranks as administrators. Henry encouraged [[Gregorian Reform|ecclesiastical reform]], but became embroiled in a serious dispute in 1101 with Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], which was resolved through a compromise solution in 1105. He supported the [[Cluniac]] order and played a major role in the selection of the senior clergy in England and Normandy.\\n\\nHenry's son William drowned in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry took a second wife, [[Adeliza of Louvain]], in the hope of having another son, but their marriage was childless. In response to this, he declared his daughter Matilda his heir and married her to [[Geoffrey of Anjou]]. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with [[County of Anjou|Anjou]]. Henry died on 1 December 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew [[Stephen of Blois]], resulting in a period of civil war known as [[the Anarchy]].\\n{{TOC limit|3}}\\n\\n==Early life, 1068\\u20131099==\\n===Childhood and appearance, 1068\\u20131086===\\nHenry was probably born in England in 1068, in either the summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly in the town of [[Selby]] in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=HollisterGreenP20>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=30\\u201331}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=20}}</ref>{{refn|The dating of Henry's birth depends on comparing chronicler accounts and the travels of his parents William and Matilda; these give only limited periods in which Henry could have been conceived and born.

The Sahel has a [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] and stretches across the [[tropics|southernmost latitudes]] of [[North Africa]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. Although geographically located in the tropics, the Sahel does not have a [[tropical climate]].\\n\\nEspecially in the western Sahel, there are [[droughts in the Sahel|frequent]] shortages of food and water due to its very high [[Corruption Perceptions Index|government corruption]] and the [[semi-arid climate]].

Several isolated plateaus and mountain ranges rise from the Sahel (e.g. [[Marrah Mountains]], [[A\\u00efr Mountains]], [[Ennedi Plateau]]), but are designated as separate ecoregions because their flora and fauna are distinct from the surrounding lowlands (e.g. [[East Saharan montane xeric woodlands|East Saharan woodlands]]). Annual rainfall varies from around {{convert|abbr=on|100|-|200|mm|in|0}} in the north of the Sahel to around {{convert|abbr=on|700|-|1,000|mm|in|0}} in the south.<ref name=\\\"wwf\\\"/>\\n\\n==Flora and fauna==\\nThe Sahel is mostly covered in grassland and savanna, with areas of woodland and shrubland. Grass cover is fairly continuous across the region, dominated by annual grass species such as ''[[Cenchrus biflorus]], [[Schoenefeldia gracilis]]'' and ''[[Aristida stipoides]]''. Species of [[acacia]] are the dominant trees, with ''[[Acacia tortilis]]'' the most common, along with ''[[Senegalia senegal]]'' and ''[[Senegalia laeta]]''. Other tree species include ''[[Commiphora africana]]'', ''[[Balanites aegyptiaca]]'', ''[[Faidherbia albida]]'', and ''[[Boscia senegalensis]]''. In the northern part of the Sahel, areas of desert shrub, including ''[[Panicum turgidum]]'' and ''[[Aristida sieberiana]]'', alternate with areas of grassland and savanna. During the long dry season, many trees lose their leaves and the predominantly annual grasses die.\\n\\nThe Sahel was formerly home to large populations of grazing mammals, including the [[scimitar oryx|scimitar-horned oryx]] ''(Oryx dammah)'', [[dama gazelle]] ''(Gazella dama)'', [[Dorcas gazelle]] ''(Gazella dorcas)'', [[red-fronted gazelle]] ''(Gazella rufifrons)'', the giant prehistoric buffalo ''([[Pelorovis]])'', and [[Bubal hartebeest]] ''(Alcelaphus buselaphus buselaphus)'', along with large predators, such as the [[African wild dog]] ''(Lycaon pictus)'', the [[Northwest African cheetah]] ''(Acinonyx jubatus hecki)'', the [[Northeast African cheetah]] ''(Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii)'', and the [[lion]] ''(Panthera leo)''. The larger species have been greatly reduced in number by over-hunting and competition with livestock, and several species are [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] (Dorcas gazelle, cheetah, lion and red-fronted gazelle), [[endangered species|endangered]] ([[Dama gazelle]] and [[African wild dog]]), or [[extinction|extinct]] (the Scimitar-horned oryx is probably [[extinct in the wild]], and both ''[[Pelorovis]]'' and the Bubal hartebeest are now extinct).\\n\\nThe seasonal wetlands of the Sahel are important for [[migratory bird]]s moving within Africa and on the [[African-Eurasian flyways]].<ref name=\\\"wwf\\\"/>\\n\\n== Climate ==\\n[[File:Acacia Trees (24227057806).jpg|thumb|[[Ennedi Plateau]] is located at the border of the Sahara and the Sahel]]\\n[[File:Seasonal westafrica rainfall mean 20070501 20070930.gif|thumb|right|10 year average precipitation during the summer rainy season (May - September) in the Sahel and adjacent regions]]\\nThe Sahel has a [[tropical]] [[Hot semi-arid climate|semi-arid climate]] ([[K\\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BSh''). The climate is typically hot, sunny, dry and somewhat windy all year long. The Sahel's climate is similar to, but less extreme than, the climate of the [[Sahara desert]] located just to the north.\\n\\nThe Sahel mainly receives a low to very low amount of precipitation annually. The steppe has a very long, prevailing dry season and a short rainy season. The precipitation is also extremely irregular, and varies considerably from season to season. Most of the rain usually falls during four to six months in the middle of the year, while the other months may remain absolutely dry. The interior of the Sahel region generally receives between 200&nbsp;mm and 700&nbsp;mm of rain yearly. A system of subdivisions often adopted for the Sahelian climate based on annual rainfall is as follows: the Saharan-Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 100 and 200&nbsp;mm (such as [[Khartoum]], Sudan), the strict Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 200 and 700&nbsp;mm (such as [[Niamey]], Niger) and the Sahelian-Sudanese climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 700 and 900&nbsp;mm (such as [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso). The [[relative humidity]] in the steppe is low to very low, often between 10% and 25% during the dry season and between 25% and 75% during the rainy season. The least humid places have a relative humidity under 35%.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\\n\\nThe Sahel is characterized by constant, intense heat, with an unvarying temperature. The Sahel rarely experiences cold temperatures.

It originated as an intermittent serial in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in 1888\\u201389 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The ''Diary'' records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, [[Charles Pooter]], his wife Carrie, his son William Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months.\\n\\nBefore their collaboration on the ''Diary'', the brothers each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated nine of the principal comedian roles in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano [[sketch comedy|sketch]] entertainer and wrote a large number of songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The ''Diary'' was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the ''Diary'' were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.\\n\\nAlthough its initial public reception was muted, the ''Diary'' came to be recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and it has never been out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or lower-middle class aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The ''Diary'' has been the subject of several stage and screen adaptations, including [[Ken Russell]]'s \\\"silent film\\\" treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts.\\n\\n==Authorship and origin==\\n[[File:Weedon-and-George-Grossmith.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Grossmith|George]] (right) and [[Weedon Grossmith]]|alt=Two men in suits. There is a family resemblance.]]\\n''The Diary of a Nobody'' was the work of [[George Grossmith]] and his brother [[Weedon Grossmith]], the sons of a court reporter and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the [[West London School of Art]] and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor.<ref name= JH/> The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at [[Haverstock|Haverstock Hill]]. This included a 20-minute [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] version of ''[[Hamlet]]'', in which George played the title role; Weedon was [[Ophelia]].<ref>{{cite web|last= Grossmith|first= George|title= A Society Clown: Reminiscences.

In that year he was seen by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and, separately, by [[W. S. Gilbert]], in performances of their one-act comic opera ''[[Trial by Jury]]''. Impressed, they engaged him to play the comic lead in their new, full-length work, ''[[The Sorcerer]]''.<ref>Bailey, pp. 116\\u2013117</ref> Thereafter, Grossmith created the leading comic role in each of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s long-running comic operas until ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which closed in 1889.<ref name= JH/> While appearing in the operas, Grossmith continued his piano entertainment career at private parties and matinees, writing and composing his own material.

He wrote several plays, of which ''The Night of the Party'' (1901) was his most successful, and from 1894 was engaged in the management of two [[West End theatre]]s.

In a short prologue, readers are informed that [[Charles Pooter]] and his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at \\\"The Laurels\\\", Brickfield Terrace, [[Holloway, London|Holloway]]. Mr Pooter is a [[City of London]] clerk with Perkupp's, possibly an [[Accountant|accountancy]] or private banking firm (though their business is not explicitly stated). The couple's 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk in [[Oldham]]. The first entries describe the Pooters' daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses from [[Sutton, London|Sutton]]. From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters' daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter's unconscious self-importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations.\\n\\nThe rare formal social events in the Pooters' lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from the [[Lord Mayor of London]] to attend a ball at the [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] for \\\"Representatives of Trade and Commerce\\\". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished. Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.\\n\\nIn the summer their son arrives from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, \\\"Lupin\\\". He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupp's. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week in [[Broadstairs]], but relationships are strained by Lupin's \\\"fast\\\" habits. On their return, Pooter's efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the \\\"Holloway Comedians\\\". With the help of Pooter's employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement.\\n[[File:Daisy-mutlar.gif|thumb|left|upright |Daisy Mutlar|alt=A drawing of a young woman in a dark dress and a bonnet]]\\nLupin's fianc\\u00e9e, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, \\\"the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met\\\".   Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: \\\"She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking\\\". Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.\\n\\nIn the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to \\\"The Laurels\\\". These occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if by right. Lupin opts out of the family's Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone's astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy.\\n\\nIn the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by \\u00a3100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement that he has just profited by \\u00a3200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest \\u00a3600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.\\n\\nApril begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests\\u2014among them Mr Padge\\u2014with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle, who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.\\n\\nLupin is sacked from Perkupp's for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillon, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with a \\u00a325 commission and a job at \\u00a3200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh.   Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray's sister, known as \\\"Lillie Girl\\\", a woman of around 30.

He was the fourth son of [[William the Conqueror]] and was educated in [[Latin]] and the [[liberal arts]]. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder brothers [[Robert Curthose]] and [[William Rufus]] inherited [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and England, respectively, but Henry was left landless. He purchased the County of [[Cotentin]] in western Normandy from Robert, but his brothers deposed him in 1091. He gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William Rufus against Robert.\\n\\nPresent in England with his brother William, who died in a hunting accident, Henry seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. He married [[Matilda of Scotland]] and they had two surviving children, [[Empress Matilda]] and [[William Adelin]]; he also had many illegitimate children by his numerous mistresses. Robert, who invaded from Normandy in 1101, disputed Henry's control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. The peace was short-lived, and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106, finally defeating Robert at the [[Battle of Tinchebray]]. Henry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry's control of Normandy was challenged by [[Louis VI of France]], [[Baldwin VII of Flanders]] and [[Fulk V of Anjou]], who promoted the rival claims of Robert's son, [[William Clito]], and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119. Following Henry's victory at the [[Battle of Br\\u00e9mule]], a favourable peace settlement was agreed with Louis in 1120.\\n\\nConsidered by contemporaries to be a harsh but effective ruler, Henry skilfully manipulated the barons in England and Normandy. In England, he drew on the existing [[Anglo-Saxon]] system of justice, local government and taxation, but also strengthened it with more institutions, including the royal [[exchequer]] and itinerant [[justices]]. Normandy was also governed through a growing system of justices and an exchequer. Many of the officials who ran Henry's system were \\\"new men\\\" of obscure backgrounds, rather than from families of high status, who rose through the ranks as administrators. Henry encouraged [[Gregorian Reform|ecclesiastical reform]], but became embroiled in a serious dispute in 1101 with Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], which was resolved through a compromise solution in 1105. He supported the [[Cluniac]] order and played a major role in the selection of the senior clergy in England and Normandy.\\n\\nHenry's son William drowned in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry took a second wife, [[Adeliza of Louvain]], in the hope of having another son, but their marriage was childless. In response to this, he declared his daughter Matilda his heir and married her to [[Geoffrey of Anjou]]. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with [[County of Anjou|Anjou]]. Henry died on 1 December 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew [[Stephen of Blois]], resulting in a period of civil war known as [[the Anarchy]].\\n{{TOC limit|3}}\\n\\n==Early life, 1068\\u20131099==\\n===Childhood and appearance, 1068\\u20131086===\\nHenry was probably born in England in 1068, in either the summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly in the town of [[Selby]] in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=HollisterGreenP20>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=30\\u201331}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=20}}</ref>{{refn|The dating of Henry's birth depends on comparing chronicler accounts and the travels of his parents William and Matilda; these give only limited periods in which Henry could have been conceived and born.

Henry Mayr-Harting also doubts the extent of the evidence for a mid-life change, but draws out more of his earlier piety, suggesting that Henry was always more religiously inclined than was once thought.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|pp=46}};

The Sahel has a [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] and stretches across the [[tropics|southernmost latitudes]] of [[North Africa]] between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. Although geographically located in the tropics, the Sahel does not have a [[tropical climate]].\\n\\nEspecially in the western Sahel, there are [[droughts in the Sahel|frequent]] shortages of food and water due to its very high [[Corruption Perceptions Index|government corruption]] and the [[semi-arid climate]]. This is exacerbated by very high [[list of countries by birth rate|birthrates]] across the region, resulting in a rapid increase in population.

Several isolated plateaus and mountain ranges rise from the Sahel (e.g. [[Marrah Mountains]], [[A\\u00efr Mountains]], [[Ennedi Plateau]]), but are designated as separate ecoregions because their flora and fauna are distinct from the surrounding lowlands (e.g. [[East Saharan montane xeric woodlands|East Saharan woodlands]]). Annual rainfall varies from around {{convert|abbr=on|100|-|200|mm|in|0}} in the north of the Sahel to around {{convert|abbr=on|700|-|1,000|mm|in|0}} in the south.<ref name=\\\"wwf\\\"/>\\n\\n==Flora and fauna==\\nThe Sahel is mostly covered in grassland and savanna, with areas of woodland and shrubland. Grass cover is fairly continuous across the region, dominated by annual grass species such as ''[[Cenchrus biflorus]], [[Schoenefeldia gracilis]]'' and ''[[Aristida stipoides]]''. Species of [[acacia]] are the dominant trees, with ''[[Acacia tortilis]]'' the most common, along with ''[[Senegalia senegal]]'' and ''[[Senegalia laeta]]''. Other tree species include ''[[Commiphora africana]]'', ''[[Balanites aegyptiaca]]'', ''[[Faidherbia albida]]'', and ''[[Boscia senegalensis]]''. In the northern part of the Sahel, areas of desert shrub, including ''[[Panicum turgidum]]'' and ''[[Aristida sieberiana]]'', alternate with areas of grassland and savanna. During the long dry season, many trees lose their leaves and the predominantly annual grasses die.\\n\\nThe Sahel was formerly home to large populations of grazing mammals, including the [[scimitar oryx|scimitar-horned oryx]] ''(Oryx dammah)'', [[dama gazelle]] ''(Gazella dama)'', [[Dorcas gazelle]] ''(Gazella dorcas)'', [[red-fronted gazelle]] ''(Gazella rufifrons)'', the giant prehistoric buffalo ''([[Pelorovis]])'', and [[Bubal hartebeest]] ''(Alcelaphus buselaphus buselaphus)'', along with large predators, such as the [[African wild dog]] ''(Lycaon pictus)'', the [[Northwest African cheetah]] ''(Acinonyx jubatus hecki)'', the [[Northeast African cheetah]] ''(Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii)'', and the [[lion]] ''(Panthera leo)''. The larger species have been greatly reduced in number by over-hunting and competition with livestock, and several species are [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] (Dorcas gazelle, cheetah, lion and red-fronted gazelle), [[endangered species|endangered]] ([[Dama gazelle]] and [[African wild dog]]), or [[extinction|extinct]] (the Scimitar-horned oryx is probably [[extinct in the wild]], and both ''[[Pelorovis]]'' and the Bubal hartebeest are now extinct).\\n\\nThe seasonal wetlands of the Sahel are important for [[migratory bird]]s moving within Africa and on the [[African-Eurasian flyways]].<ref name=\\\"wwf\\\"/>\\n\\n== Climate ==\\n[[File:Acacia Trees (24227057806).jpg|thumb|[[Ennedi Plateau]] is located at the border of the Sahara and the Sahel]]\\n[[File:Seasonal westafrica rainfall mean 20070501 20070930.gif|thumb|right|10 year average precipitation during the summer rainy season (May - September) in the Sahel and adjacent regions]]\\nThe Sahel has a [[tropical]] [[Hot semi-arid climate|semi-arid climate]] ([[K\\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BSh''). The climate is typically hot, sunny, dry and somewhat windy all year long. The Sahel's climate is similar to, but less extreme than, the climate of the [[Sahara desert]] located just to the north.\\n\\nThe Sahel mainly receives a low to very low amount of precipitation annually. The steppe has a very long, prevailing dry season and a short rainy season. The precipitation is also extremely irregular, and varies considerably from season to season. Most of the rain usually falls during four to six months in the middle of the year, while the other months may remain absolutely dry. The interior of the Sahel region generally receives between 200&nbsp;mm and 700&nbsp;mm of rain yearly. A system of subdivisions often adopted for the Sahelian climate based on annual rainfall is as follows: the Saharan-Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 100 and 200&nbsp;mm (such as [[Khartoum]], Sudan), the strict Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 200 and 700&nbsp;mm (such as [[Niamey]], Niger) and the Sahelian-Sudanese climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 700 and 900&nbsp;mm (such as [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso). The [[relative humidity]] in the steppe is low to very low, often between 10% and 25% during the dry season and between 25% and 75% during the rainy season. The least humid places have a relative humidity under 35%.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}\\n\\nThe Sahel is characterized by constant, intense heat, with an unvarying temperature. The Sahel rarely experiences cold temperatures. During the hottest period, the average high temperatures are generally between {{convert|36|and|42|\\u00b0C}} (and even more in the hottest regions), often for more than three months, while the average low temperatures are around {{convert|25|to|31|\\u00b0C}}.

From 1951 to 2004, the Sahel experienced some of the most consistent and severe droughts in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scholl|first=Adam|title=Map Room: Hidden Waters|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2012/map-room|publisher=World Policy Journal|access-date=17 December 2012}}</ref> The 1960s saw a large increase in rainfall in the region, making the northern drier region more accessible. There was a push, supported by governments, for people to move northwards. When the long drought period from 1968 through 1974 began, grazing quickly became unsustainable and large-scale denuding of the terrain followed. Like the drought in 1914, this led to a large-scale famine, but this time somewhat tempered by international visibility and an outpouring of aid. This catastrophe led to the founding of the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]].\\n\\n===2010 drought===\\n{{Main|2010 Sahel famine}} \\nBetween June and August 2010, famine struck the Sahel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/africa/drought+threatens+african+humanitarian+crisis/3697427 |title=Drought threatens African humanitarian crisis \\u2013 Channel 4 News |publisher=Channel4.com |date=2010-07-01 |access-date=2010-07-28}}</ref> Niger's crops failed to mature in the heat, 350,000 faced starvation, and 1,200,000 were at risk of famine.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/21/millions-face-starvation-west-africa | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Millions face starvation in west Africa, warn aid agencies | first=Henry | last=Foy | date=2010-06-21}}</ref> In Chad the temperature reached {{convert|47.6|\\u00b0C|\\u00b0F|1|abbr=on}} on 22 June in [[Faya-Largeau]], breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location.
