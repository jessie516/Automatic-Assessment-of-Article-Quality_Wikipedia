The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought on a [[Promontory of Quebec|plateau]] by the British Army and Royal Navy against the French Army, just outside the [[Ramparts of Quebec City|walls of Quebec City]] on land that was originally owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops in total, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between [[France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] over the fate of [[New France]], influencing the later creation of [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishbattles.com/battle-of-quebec.htm |title=Battle of Quebec |year=2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218174313/http://www.britishbattles.com/battle-of-quebec.htm |archive-date=18 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}</ref>\\n\\nThe culmination of a three-month [[siege]] by the British, the battle lasted about an hour. British troops commanded by General [[James Wolfe]] successfully resisted the [[Column (formation)|column]] advance of French troops and [[Canada (New France)|Canadian]] militia under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm]], employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts. Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle; Wolfe died of gunshot wounds just as the French began to retreat and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a [[musket ball]] wound just below his ribs. In the wake of the battle, the French evacuated the city.\\n\\nThe French forces would attempt to recapture Quebec the following spring, and in the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]], they forced the British to retreat within the walls. However, the French [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|failed to take the city]] and in 1763, following defeat in the [[Montreal campaign]], France [[Cession|ceded]] most of its possessions in eastern North America to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].\\n\\nThe decisive success of the British forces on the Plains of Abraham and the subsequent capture of Quebec became part of what was known in Great Britain as the \\\"[[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|Annus Mirabilis]]\\\" of 1759.\\n\\n==Overview==\\n[[Image:General-james-wolfe.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Wolfe printed ''circa'' 1776]]\\n\\nAs the [[Seven Years' War]] entered its later stages through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attack from British armies. In 1758 after their defeat in July at the [[Battle of Carillon]], the British took [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Louisbourg]] in August, causing Atlantic Canada to fall into their hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. The British also captured [[Fort Frontenac]] in the same month, costing the French supplies for the [[Ohio Valley]] campaign. When some of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] supporters of the French made peace with the British, France was forced to draw its troops back. The French leaders, specifically Governor [[Pierre Fran\\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal|de Vaudreuil]] and General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|Montcalm]], were unsettled by the British successes. However, Quebec was still able to protect itself as the British prepared a three-pronged attack for 1759.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|pp=178\\u2013179}}.</ref>\\n\\n[[James Wolfe]] expected to lead 12,000 men, but was greeted by only approximately 7,000 regular troops, 400 [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], and 300 gunners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=25}}.</ref> He was supported by a fleet of 49 ships and 140 smaller craft led by Admiral [[Charles Saunders (admiral)|Charles Saunders]].\\n\\n[[File: The Defeat of the French Fireships attacking the British Fleet at Anchor before Quebec.jpg|thumbnail|French [[fire ships]] sent downriver to block the British advance, as shown in a copy of a painting by [[Dominic Serres]]]]\\nIn preparation for the fleet's approach to Quebec, [[James Cook]] surveyed a large portion of the river, including a dangerous channel known as The Traverse. Cook's ship was one of the first ships up the river, sounding the channel and guiding the fleet as it moved up; Wolfe and his men landed on the [[\\u00cele d'Orl\\u00e9ans]] on 28 June.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hayes|2002|p=106}}.</ref> The French attempted to attack the fleet by sending seven [[fire ships]] downriver to disrupt the landing, but the ships were set afire too early and British sailors in longboats were able to pull the flaming craft clear of the fleet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1972|p=199}}.</ref>\\nThe following day, Wolfe's troops landed on the south bank of the river at [[L\\u00e9vis, Quebec|Point Levis]], nearly directly across the river from Quebec; an [[artillery]] battery was established there in early July that nearly levelled the lower town by [[bombardment]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|p=69}}.</ref>\\n\\nDespite an air of [[defeatism]] among the leadership,<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 197\\\">{{Harvnb|Eccles|1972|p=197}}.</ref> the French troops and New French militia defenders focused their preparations for British attacks on the [[Beauport Shore]]. Montcalm and his staff, Major-General [[Fran\\u00e7ois de Gaston, Chevalier de L\\u00e9vis]], Colonel [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], and Lieutenant-Colonel de Sennezergue,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|p=16}}.</ref> distributed some 12,000 troops in a nine-kilometre-long collection of fortified [[redoubt]]s and batteries from the [[Saint-Charles River (Quebec City)|Saint-Charles River]] to the [[Montmorency Falls]], along the shallows of the river in areas that had previously been targeted by British attempts to land.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|pp=10\\u201311}}.</ref> Before the British, a small fleet of supply ships had arrived in Quebec with much-needed supplies.<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 197\\\" /> Those supplies, along with 500 reinforcements, likely aided French resistance during the lengthy siege.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=345}}.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Siege of Quebec.svg|thumb|right|Initial British landing, claiming the [[L\\u00e9vis, Quebec|Point Levis]] and the unsuccessful attack on 31 August]]\\nWolfe, on surveying the town of Beauport, found that the houses there had been barricaded and organized to allow for musket fire from within; they were built in an unbroken line along the road, providing a formidable barrier. In addition, a screen of trees along the Montmorency River made an approach on that route dangerous.<ref>{{Harvnb|Casgrain|1905|p=109}}.</ref> On 31 July, the first serious attempt by Wolfe's troops to land on the northern shore led to the [[Battle of Beauport]], also known as the Battle of Montmorency. Approximately 3,500 troops, supported by a heavy bombardment, attempted to land but were fired upon in the river shallows. Members of the [[Louisbourg Grenadiers]], who reached the beach, attempted a generally undisciplined charge on the French positions, but came under heavy fire; a thunderstorm ended the fight and allowed Wolfe to pull his troops back after taking some 450 casualties to Montcalm's 60.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|pp=35\\u201342}}.</ref>\\n\\nSome French officers felt the Montmorency defeat would be the last British attack; Vaudreuil wrote afterwards that \\\"I have no more anxiety about Quebec. Wolfe, I assure you, will make no progress... He contented himself with losing about five hundred of his best soldiers.\\\" He predicted another attack would come within days.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=98}}.</ref> Others in the French camp felt the campaign was over.<ref name=\\\"Lloyd 1959 103\\\">{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1959|p=103}}.</ref>\\n\\nFor the remainder of the summer, Wolfe's focus changed, possibly due to frustration with Montcalm's tactics. Wolfe's troops, along with [[United States Army Rangers#Early Rangers|American Rangers]], attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the St. Lawrence. An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm's army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=180}}.</ref> However, the attacks did reduce the number of suppliers available to the French, especially as the British navy, unable to control the St. Lawrence entirely, was successful in blockading the ports in France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=44}}.</ref>\\n\\n==Preparations==\\n[[Image:plains2009.jpg|thumb|left|The Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]\\nThrough the summer siege, illness spread through the British camps. In August, Wolfe himself was bedridden, causing already low morale to slump even further among the British troops.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|pp=104\\u2013107}}.</ref> With many men in camp hospitals, British fighting numbers were thinned, and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed by the end of September, or Britain's opportunity would be lost.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=201}}.</ref> In addition, his frustration with Montcalm's defensive stance continued to grow. In a letter to his mother, Wolfe wrote, \\\"The Marquis of Montcalm is at the head of a great number of bad soldiers, and I am at the head of a small number of good ones that wish for nothing so much as to fight him; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behaviour of his army.\\\" Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege, relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted, and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Casgrain|1905|p=157}}.</ref>\\n\\nAfter considering and rejecting a number of plans for landings on the north shore, a decision was made in late August by Wolfe and his brigadiers to land upriver of the city. If successful, such a landing would force Montcalm to fight, as a British force on the north shore of the St. Lawrence would cut his supply lines to Montreal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=181}}.</ref> Initial suggestions for landing sites ranged as far as {{cvt|32|km|mi}} up the St. Lawrence, which would have given the French troops one or two days to prepare for the attack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=50}}.</ref> Following the failed British assault on [[Battle of Beauport|Montmorency]], Montcalm altered his deployment, sending [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]] and a column of approximately 1,500 regular troops, 200 cavalry, and a group of New French militia\\u2014some 3,000 men in all\\u2014upriver to [[Cap-Rouge, Quebec|Cap-Rouge]] to monitor the British ships upstream.  He further strengthened his defences of the [[Beauport, Quebec City|Beauport]] shore following the abandonment of the British camp at Montmorency, which he regarded as preparations for a descent (amphibious attack) on Beauport.  In spite of warnings from local commanders, he did not view an upstream landing as a serious possibility.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|p=78}}.</ref>\\n[[File:Fleuve Saint-Laurent a Quebec.jpg|thumb|Anse au Foulon]]\\n\\nThe British, meanwhile, prepared for their risky deployment upstream.  Troops had already been aboard landing ships and drifting up and down the river for several days<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=125}}.</ref> when Wolfe on 12 September, made a final decision on the British landing site, selecting L'[[Anse-au-Foulon]].  L'Anse-au-Foulon is a cove situated west of the city, three kilometres upstream from [[Cap Diamant]].  It lies at the bottom of a {{cvt|53|m|ft|adj=on}} high cliff leading to the plateau above, and was protected by a battery of guns. It is not known why Wolfe selected Foulon, as the original landing site was to be further up the river, in a position where the British would be able to develop a foothold and strike at Bougainville's force to draw Montcalm out of Quebec and onto the plains. Brigadier-General [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]] wrote that \\\"by some intelligence the General had, he has changed his mind as to the place he intended to land\\\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=121}}.</ref> In his final letter, dated {{HMS|Sutherland|1741|6}}, 8:30&nbsp;p.m. 12 September, Wolfe wrote:\\n{{Quote|I had the honour to inform you today that it is my duty to attack the French army. To the best of my knowledge and ability, I have fixed upon that spot where we can act with most force and are most likely to succeed. If I am mistaken I am sorry for it and must be answerable to His Majesty and the public for the consequences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1959|p=117}}.</ref>}}\\n\\nWolfe's plan of attack depended on secrecy and surprise.  His plan required that a small party of men should land by night on the north shore, climb the [[Promontory of Quebec]], seize a small road, and overpower the garrison that protected it, allowing the bulk of his army (5,000 men) to ascend the cliff by the small road and then deploy for battle on the plateau.  Even if the first landing party succeeded in their mission and the army was able to follow, such a deployment would still leave his forces inside the French line of defence with no immediate retreat but the river.  It is possible that Wolfe's decision to change the landing site was owing less to a desire for secrecy and more to his general disdain for his brigadiers (a feeling that was reciprocated); it is also possible that he was still suffering the effects of his illness and the [[opiate]]s he used as painkillers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=353}}.</ref> Some revisionist historians believe Wolfe ordered the attack believing the advanced guard would be repulsed, and anticipated dying gallantly with his men rather than returning home in disgrace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|pp=354, 789}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Brumwell|2006|pp=269}}.</ref>\\n\\n==Order of battle==\\n{{wide image|Battle of Quebec 1759 SLNSW FL3542480.jpg|900px|Plan of Quebec and environs  with its defences and the occasional entrenched camps of the French commanded by Marquis de Montcalm shewing likewise the principal works and operations of the British forces, under the command of Major General Wolfe, during the siege of that place in 1759.}}\\n=== British forces ===\\nBritish forces engaged in the battle were commanded by [[Major General]] [[James Wolfe]] who commanded appx. 8,000 troops, of which only 4,500 men and 1  artillery gun were taken to the [[Plains of Abraham]].<ref name=\\\":0\\\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishbattles.com/french-indian-war/battle-of-quebec-1759/ |title=Battle of Quebec 1759 |website=www.britishbattles.com |access-date=2020-02-25 |archive-date=30 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130142530/https://www.britishbattles.com/french-indian-war/battle-of-quebec-1759/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\\\":1\\\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/index.php?title=1759-09-13_-_Battle_of_Qu%C3%A9bec#Order_of_Battle |title=1759-09-13 \\u2013 Battle of Qu\\u00e9bec \\u2013 Project Seven Years War |website=www.kronoskaf.com |access-date=2020-02-25 |archive-date=25 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925190426/http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/index.php?title=1759-09-13_-_Battle_of_Qu%C3%A9bec#Order_of_Battle |url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n'''British Army'''\\n* ''En potence'' on the right flank \\u2013 [[35th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* In reserve \\u2013 [[48th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* Protecting rear \\u2013 The Light Infantry ([[80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot]])\\n\\n'''Main Line''' under [[Major General]] [[James Wolfe]]\\n* [[Louisbourg Grenadiers]] (3 Companies)\\n* [[22nd Regiment of Foot]] (only grenadier and light infantry companies)\\n* [[40th Regiment of Foot]] (only grenadier and light infantry companies)\\n* [[45th Regiment of Foot]]\\n\\n'''Right Wing''' under [[Brigadier General]] [[Robert Monckton]]\\n* [[28th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* [[43rd Regiment of Foot]]\\n* 1 Light field gun provided by [[Royal Artillery]]\\n\\n'''Centre''' under [[Brigadier General]] [[James Murray (British Army officer, born 1721)|James Murray]]\\n* [[47th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* [[58th Regiment of Foot]] (also guarding the landing place)\\n* [[Fraser's Highlanders|78th (Fraser's) Highlanders]]\\n* 1 Light field gun provided by [[Royal Artillery]]\\n\\n'''Left Flank''' under [[Brigadier General]] [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]]\\n* [[15th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot]]\\n* 3rd Battalion, [[60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot]]\\n\\n'''Colonials'''\\n* The Light Infantry ([[80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot]]) (protecting the rear)\\n* 6 Companies of [[American Rangers]]\\n\\n=== French forces ===\\nFrench forces engaged in the battle were commanded by [[Major General]] [[Marquis De Montcalm|Louis Joseph de Saint V\\u00e9ran, Marquis de Montcalm]] commanding appx. 1,900 regulars, 1,500 militia and natives, and 4 field guns.<ref name=\\\":0\\\" /><ref name=\\\":1\\\" />\\n\\n'''Right Wing''' commanded by General Dumas\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de la Sarre]]\\n* [[Montr\\u00e9al]] and [[Qu\\u00e9bec]] Militia\\n* 2 field guns\\n\\n'''Centre''' under [[Major General]] [[Marquis De Montcalm|Louis Joseph de Saint V\\u00e9ran, Marquis de Montcalm]]\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de Languedoc]]\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de B\\u00e9arn]] (deep order, meaning they were not spread out)\\n\\n'''Left Wing''' under General Senezergues\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de Guyenne]] (deep order)\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment Royal Roussillon]]\\n* [[Montr\\u00e9al]] and [[Trois-Rivi\\u00e8res]] Militia\\n* 2 field guns\\n\\n==Landing==\\n[[File:Battle of the Plains of Abraham 1.svg|thumb|left|Landing of the British troops on 12 September]]\\nBougainville, tasked with the defence of the large area between [[Cap Diamant]] and [[Cap-Rouge, Quebec City|Cap Rouge]], was upstream with his troops at Cap Rouge on the night of 12 September, and missed seeing numerous British ships moving downstream.  A camp of approximately 100 militia led by Captain [[Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor]], who had unsuccessfully faced the British four years previously at [[Fort Beaus\\u00e9jour]], had been assigned to watch the narrow road at L'Anse-au-Foulon which followed a [[streambank]], the [[Coul\\u00e9e]] Saint-Denis. On the night of 12 September and morning of 13 September, however, the camp may have contained as few as 40 men, as others were off harvesting.<ref name=\\\"Lloyd 1959 103\\\"/> [[Pierre de Vaudreuil|Vaudreuil]] and others had expressed their concern at the possibility of L'Anse-au-Foulon being vulnerable, but Montcalm dismissed them, saying 100 men would hold off the army until daylight, remarking, \\\"It is not to be supposed that the enemies have wings so that they can in the same night cross the river, disembark, climb the obstructed acclivity, and scale the walls, for which last operation they would have to carry ladders.\\\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Casgrain|1905|p=160}}.</ref>\\n\\nSentries did detect boats moving along the river that morning, but they were expecting a French supply [[convoy]] to pass that night\\u2014a plan that had been changed without Vergor being notified.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=55}}.</ref> When the boats, loaded with the first wave of British troops, were challenged, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the [[78th Fraser Highlanders]], was able to answer the challenge in excellent French, allaying suspicion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=37}}; {{Harvnb|Lloyd|1959|p=125}}.</ref>\\n\\nThe boats, however, had drifted slightly off course: instead of landing at the base of the road, many soldiers found themselves at the base of a slope. A group of 24 volunteers led by Colonel [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] with fixed [[bayonet]]s were sent to clear the picket along the road, and climbed the slope, a manoeuvre that allowed them to come up behind Vergor's camp and capture it quickly.  Wolfe followed an hour later when he could use an easy access road to climb to the plain. Thus, by the time the sun rose over the Plains of Abraham, Wolfe's army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs of the [[promontory of Quebec]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|pp=58\\u201361}}.</ref>\\n\\n==Battle==\\n[[Image:NSRW Siege of Quebec.png|left|thumb|Map of the Quebec City area showing disposition of French and British forces.

Many of the militia were inexperienced; the Acadian, Canadian, and indigenous [[irregulars]] were more used to guerrilla warfare. By contrast, the British 7,700 troops were almost all [[Regular Army|regulars]].\\n\\nOn the morning of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with their backs to the river, then spread out across the Plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=61}}.</ref>\\n\\nOf the British troops, approximately 3,300 formed into a shallow [[horseshoe]] formation that stretched across the width of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and [[gristmill]] to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire to keep them out of enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to the width of the lines.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=148}}.</ref> As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=69}}.</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:Montcalm leading his troops at the Plains of Abraham.jpg|thumb|Montcalm leading his troops into battle. Watercolour by [[Charles William Jefferys]] (1869\\u20131951)]]\\nAs French troops arrived from Beauport, Montcalm, one of few mounted men on the field, decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the British from their position.  Accordingly, he deployed the forces immediately available in and near Quebec City and prepared an immediate attack, without waiting for further reinforcements from the Beauport shore.  He arrayed his approximately 3,500 soldiers into place, his best regulars three deep, others six deep and his poorest regiment in column. At approximately 10&nbsp;a.m., Montcalm, riding his dark horse and waving his sword to encourage his men,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|p=86}}.</ref> ordered a general advance on the British line.\\n\\nAs a European-trained military leader, Montcalm's instinct was for large, set-piece battles in which regiments and soldiers moved in precise order.  Such actions required a disciplined soldiery, painstakingly drilled for as long as 18 months on the parade ground, trained to march in time, change formation at a word, and retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys.<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 197\\\"/> Though his regular regiments (the \\\"troupes de terre\\\" or \\\"metropolitans\\\") were adept at such formal warfare, in the course of the campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen, whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual: they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload, thus reducing the effect of concentrated fire at close range.<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 182\\\">{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=182}}.</ref>\\n\\n===Main engagement===\\n[[File:Battle of the Plains of Abraham 3.svg|thumb|left|French forces in retreat]]\\nAs the French approached, the British lines held their fire. Wolfe had devised a firing method for stopping French column advances in 1755 that called for the centre\\u2014in this case, the [[43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot|43rd]] and [[47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot|47th]] Foot regiments\\u2014to hold fire while waiting for the advancing force to approach within {{cvt|30|yd|m}}, then open fire at close range.\\n\\nThe French held their fire and both armies waited for two or three minutes.

The [[78th Fraser Highlanders]] were ordered by Brigadier-General [[James Murray (Quebec governor)|James Murray]] to pursue the French with their [[sword]]s, but were met near the city by a heavy fire from a floating battery covering the bridge over the St. Charles River as well as militia that remained in the trees.

He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming French, a day-saving manoeuvre; instead of attacking with a well rested and ready force, Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm's army slipped back across the St. Charles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=363}}.</ref>\\n\\nDuring the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, was struck by either [[canister shot]] from the British artillery or repeated musket fire, suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh.

James Murray, the British commander, had experienced a terrible winter, in which scurvy had reduced his garrison to only 4,000. On 28 April, L\\u00e9vis' forces met and defeated the British at the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]], immediately west of the city (near the site of [[Universit\\u00e9 Laval]] today). This battle proved bloodier than that of the Plains of Abraham, with about 850 casualties on the French side and 1,100 on the British side. The French had defeated the British, but the British were able to withdraw within the walls of Quebec, to which the French [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|laid siege]]. A lack of artillery and ammunition, combined with British improvements to the fortifications, meant that the French were unable to take the city by storm.

Leaders of separatist parties described the event as a slap in the face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/organizers-cancel-mock-battle-of-the-plains-of-abraham-1.787562 |title=CBC News: Organizers cancel mock Battle of the Plains of Abraham |access-date=24 September 2018 |archive-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027142038/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/organizers-cancel-mock-battle-of-the-plains-of-abraham-1.787562 |url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nAnother commemorative event was proposed for the anniversary, the ''Moulin \\u00e0 paroles''.

cruiser]] that was built for the [[Royal Navy]]. She is now permanently moored as a [[museum ship]] on the [[River Thames]] in [[London]] and is operated by the [[Imperial War Museum]].\\n\\nConstruction of ''Belfast'', the first ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the capital city of [[Northern Ireland]] and one of ten Town-class cruisers, began in December 1936. She was launched on [[St Patrick's Day]] 1938. Commissioned in early August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], ''Belfast'' was initially part of the British naval blockade against Germany. In November 1939, ''Belfast'' struck a German [[naval mine|mine]] and, in spite of fears that she would be scrapped, spent more than two years undergoing extensive repairs. ''Belfast'' returned to action in November 1942 with improved firepower, radar equipment, and armour. ''Belfast'' saw action escorting [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] to the [[Soviet Union]] during 1943 and in December 1943 played an important role in the [[Battle of North Cape]], assisting in the destruction of the German warship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}. In June 1944, ''Belfast'' took part in [[Operation Overlord]] supporting the [[Normandy landings]]. In June 1945, she was redeployed to the Far East to join the [[British Pacific Fleet]], arriving shortly before the end of the Second World War. ''Belfast'' saw further combat action in {{nowrap|1950\\u201352}} during the [[Korean War]] and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959. A number of further overseas commissions followed before she entered reserve in 1963.\\n\\nIn 1967, efforts were initiated to avert ''Belfast''{{'s}} expected scrapping and to preserve her as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]], and the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] was established and then reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971, however, the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS ''Belfast'' Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near [[Tower Bridge]] in the [[Pool of London]]. Opened to the public in October 1971, ''Belfast'' became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978. Since 1973 she has been home to the [[Sea Cadets (United Kingdom)|City of London Sea Cadets]] who meet on board twice a week.<ref>{{Cite web  |url=https://www.sea-cadets.org/cityoflondon/get-in-touch |title=Get in touch |website=City of London Sea Cadets}}</ref> A popular tourist attraction, ''Belfast'' received over 327,000 visitors in 2019.<ref name=\\\"ALVA 2019 visitor numbers\\\">{{cite web |title=ALVA \\u2013 Association of Leading Visitor Attractions |url=https://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423 |website=www.alva.org.uk |access-date=28 October 2020}}</ref> As a branch of a national museum and part of the [[National Historic Fleet]], ''Belfast'' is supported by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], admissions income, and the museum's commercial activities.\\n\\n==Design==\\n[[File:HMS Belfast shells1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=\\\"A circular rack of conical shells. The shell cases are yellow, the rest of the room is white.|Shells in a rack in the underwater magazine serving the \\\"A\\\" turret of ''Belfast''.]]\\n''Belfast'' is a cruiser of the [[Town-class cruiser (1936)|third Town class]]. The Town class had originated in 1933 as the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]]'s response to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{sclass|Mogami|cruiser|2}}, an {{formatnum:11200}}-ton cruiser mounting fifteen {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns with a top speed exceeding {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}}. The Admiralty's [[requirement]] called for a 9,000-ton cruiser, sufficiently armoured to withstand a direct hit from an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|0}} shell, capable of {{convert|32|kn|km/h}} and mounting twelve 6-inch guns. Seaplanes carried aboard would enable shipping lanes to be patrolled over a wide area, and the class was also to be capable of its own anti-aircraft defence.{{sfn|Wingate |2004 |p=7}} Under the [[Director of Naval Construction]] the new design evolved during 1933.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=6}} The lead ship of the new class, the 9,100-ton {{HMS|Southampton|83|6}}, and her [[Sister ship|sister]] {{HMS|Newcastle|C76|6}}, were ordered under the 1933 estimates.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=8}} Three more cruisers were built to this design, with a further three ships built to a slightly larger 9,400-ton design in 1935\\u201336.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=8}} By 1935, however, the Admiralty was keen to improve the firepower of these cruisers to match the firepower of the Japanese ''Mogami'' and American {{sclass|Brooklyn|cruiser|2}}s; both were armed with fifteen 6-inch guns.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=6}} The Admiralty rejected a design featuring five triple turrets as impractical, while an alternative design fitting four quadruple turrets was rejected as an effective quadruple turret could not be developed.{{sfn|Watton|1985|pp=6\\u20137}} In May 1936 the Admiralty decided to fit triple turrets, whose improved design would permit an increase in deck armour.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=7}} This modified design became the 10,000-ton ''Edinburgh'' subclass, named after ''Belfast''{{'}}s sister ship {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}}.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=8}} ''Belfast'' was ordered from [[Harland and Wolff]] on 21 September 1936,{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}} and her keel laid on 10 December 1936.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}} Her expected cost was \\u00a32,141,514; of which the guns cost \\u00a375,000 and the aircraft (two [[Supermarine Walrus]]es) \\u00a366,500.<ref name=IWM1>{{cite web |url=http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.125 |title=History of HMS Belfast: Building and Launch |year=2009 |website=Imperial War Museum |access-date=8 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080612093723/http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.125 |archive-date=12 June 2008}}</ref> She was launched on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], 17 March 1938, by [[Anne Chamberlain]], the wife of Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}} The launch was filmed by [[Path\\u00e9 News]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mrs-chamberlain-opens-new-airport-at-belfast-and-l |title=Mrs Chamberlain Opens New Airport At Belfast And Launches HMS Belfast (1938) |website=British Path\\u00e9 |access-date=15 March 2013}}</ref> From March to August 1939, ''Belfast'' was fitted out and underwent sea trials.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}}\\n\\n[[File:HMS Belfast - Boiler diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of one of ''Belfast''{{'}}s boilers.]]When completed, ''Belfast'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|613|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|63|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|17|ft|3|in|m|1}}.

These could be launched from a D1H [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] mounted aft of the forward superstructure, and recovered from the water by two cranes mounted on either side of the forward funnel. The aircraft, operated by the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s HMS ''Belfast'' Flight of [[700 Naval Air Squadron]], were stowed in two hangars in the forward superstructure.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=28}}\\n\\n==Second World War==\\n\\n===1939\\u20131942: Commissioning, prize capture, mining, and repairs===\\n''Belfast'' departed for [[Portsmouth]] on 3 August 1939, and was commissioned on 5 August 1939, less than a month before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Her first captain was [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] G A Scott with a crew of 761, and her first assignment was to the [[Home Fleet]]'s [[2nd Cruiser Squadron]]. On 14 August, ''Belfast'' took part in her first exercise, Operation [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Hipper'']], in which she played the role of a German [[commerce raider]] attempting to escape into the Atlantic. By navigating the hazardous [[Pentland Firth]], ''Belfast'' successfully evaded the Home Fleet.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=33}}\\n\\nOn 31 August 1939 ''Belfast'' was transferred to the [[18th Cruiser Squadron]]. Based at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney]] islands, 18th Cruiser Squadron was part of the British effort to impose a naval [[blockade]] on Germany. Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] the following day, and Britain and France declared war on 3 September. At 11:40 that morning, ''Belfast'' received the message \\u2018Commence hostilities at once against Germany\\u2019.{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=77}} On 8 September ''Belfast'' put to sea from Scapa Flow with the [[battlecruiser]]s {{HMS|Hood||2}}, {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}}, her sister ship ''Edinburgh'' and four [[destroyer]]s, on a patrol intended to intercept German ships returning from Norway. In particular, they were to search for the [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] liner {{SS|Europa|1928|2}}. No enemy vessels were found.{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=77}} On 25 September, ''Belfast'' took part in a fleet operation to recover the submarine {{HMS|Spearfish||2}}, during which the ship was attacked by German aircraft, but suffered no damage.{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=80}} On 1 October 1939 ''Belfast'' left Scapa Flow for a patrol in the North Sea. On 5 October ''Belfast'' intercepted and boarded a neutral Norwegian factory ship that was sailing in company with six whaling ships. {{Sfn |Lavery |2015 |p=81-82}} On 8 October the ship sighted the Swedish merchant ship ''C. P. Lilljevach'' but, in poor weather, did not intercept or board her. The following day she boarded ''Tai Yin'', a Norwegian ship. ''Tai Yin'' had been listed by the Admiralty as suspicious, so a [[prize crew]] from ''Belfast'' sailed her to [[Kirkwall]] for investigation.{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=82}} On 9 October ''Belfast'' intercepted a German liner, the 13,615-ton ''Cap Norte'', {{convert|50|mi|km}} north-west of the [[Faroe Islands]]. Disguised as a neutral Swedish vessel, SS ''Ancona'', ''Cap Norte'' was attempting to return to Germany from Brazil; her passengers included German reservists.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=33}} Under the Admiralty's [[prize rules]], ''Belfast''{{'}}s crew later received prize money.<ref name=IWMoutbreak>{{cite web |url=http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.176n |title=History of HMS Belfast: Outbreak of War 1939 |year=2009 |website=Imperial War Museum |access-date=3 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080612093723/http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.176 |archive-date=12 June 2008}}</ref> On 12 October ''Belfast'' boarded the Swedish ship ''Uddeholm'', which was also sailed to Kirkwall by a prize crew.{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=85}} Returning to harbour, on the night of 13\\u201314 October, ''Belfast'' was among the few ships anchored in Scapa Flow, following intelligence reports of an expected air raid. That night, the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} was torpedoed by German submarine {{GS|U-47|1938|2}}, which had infiltrated the anchorage. On the morning following the sinking, ''Belfast'' left for [[Loch Ewe]].{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=85-86}}\\n\\nOn 10 November ''Belfast'' was taken off the northern patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at [[Rosyth]]. On 21 November, ''Belfast'' was to take part in the force's first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58&nbsp;am she detonated a magnetic [[naval mine|mine]] while leaving the [[Firth of Forth]]. The mine broke ''Belfast''{{'}}s keel, and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=34\\u201335}} Twenty officers and men required hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion, and a further 26 suffered minor injuries. One man, Painter 2nd Class Henry Stanton, was hospitalised but later died of a head injury, having been thrown against the deckhead by the blast.{{Sfn |Lavery |2015|p=15-19}} The [[tugboat]] ''Krooman'', towing gunnery targets for the exercise, released her targets and instead towed ''Belfast'' to Rosyth for initial repairs.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=34\\u201335}}\\n\\nInitial assessments of ''Belfast''{{'}}s damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct damage to the outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, the shock of the explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to [[Hogging and sagging|hog]] (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 ''Belfast'' was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of [[Rosyth Dockyard]], and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]], arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=35\\u201336}}\\n\\n[[File:Hms belfast mine damage.jpg|thumb|Photograph of ''Belfast''{{'}}s damaged hull, taken while the ship was drydocked for repairs.]]During her repairs, work was carried out to straighten, reconstruct and strengthen her hull. Her armour belt was also extended and thickened.

As ''Scharnhorst'' attacked again at noon she was intercepted by Force Two and sunk by the combined formations. ''Belfast'' played an important role in the battle; as flagship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, she was among the first to encounter ''Scharnhorst'', and coordinated the squadron's defence of the convoy.

A 1918 graduate of the [[U.S. Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], Casey served in Germany during the [[Occupation of the Rhineland]]. He later returned to Germany to attend the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|''Technische Hochschule'' in Berlin]], earning a [[Doctor of Engineering]] degree.\\n\\nAs an engineer, Casey prepared a voluminous report on flood control for the [[Pittsburgh]] District. He was involved with the design and construction of the Deadman Island Lock and Dam on the [[Ohio River]], and was chief of the Engineering Division at the [[Passamaquoddy Bay#The Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project/\\\"Quoddy Dam\\\" Project|Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project]], a [[New Deal]] public works project. He went to the [[Philippines]] in 1937 to advise the government there on [[hydropower]] and flood control. In the early part of [[World War II]],  he became involved with the enormous wartime construction program. Perhaps his most notable and lasting achievement was his involvement with the design of [[The Pentagon]], the largest office building in the world.\\n\\nCasey served as [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[engineering|chief engineer]] during the [[Battle of Bataan]], in the jungles and mountains of [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]] and the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\\u201345)|Philippines]], and during the [[occupation of Japan]]. In the [[Battle of Leyte]], he commanded the Army Support Command (ASCOM), which was responsible for all construction and logistics activities in the forward area. He hoped to become [[Chief of Engineers]], but [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] passed him over. Later, Casey worked for [[Schenley Industries]] from 1951 until his retirement in 1965, and was chairman of the [[New York City Transit Authority]] from 1953 to 1955.\\n\\n==Early life==\\n[[File:Hugh John Casey (1898\\u20131981) at West Point in 1918.png|thumb|right|200px|At West Point in 1918]]\\n\\nHugh John Casey was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York on 7 June 1898, the son of John J. Casey, a plumbing and heating contractor, and Margaret L. Casey.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=xiv, 4}}</ref> John's grandparents were immigrants from [[Ireland]] and [[England]]. His grandfather served on the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] side in the [[American Civil War]] and was killed in the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. Margaret's parents were Irish immigrants who settled in [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. 5\\\">{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=5}}</ref>\\n\\nHugh Casey was educated at Manual Training High School from 1910 to 1914, graduating at the age of 15. He won a New York State scholarship and entered [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]], where he studied [[civil engineering]]. After a year there, he took a competitive examination for the [[U.S. Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] held by [[Congressman]] [[Daniel J. Griffin]], the chairman of the [[House Committee on Military Affairs]], ranking first out of 62 applicants for the appointment.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=3}}</ref> To enter, Casey claimed to be slightly older, adopting his brother's 7 June birthday.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. 5\\\"/>\\n\\nCasey entered West Point in 1915, where his best friend and roommate was [[Lucius D. Clay]]. At West Point, Casey played [[American football|football]] as a [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]], substituting for [[Elmer Oliphant]]. One of Casey's duties was tutoring Oliphant in mathematics. Casey decided that winning games was more important than playing, and he helped keep Oliphant proficient at math. Unlike most appointees to West Point, a grateful Casey wrote frequently to Griffin about his progress and sent him football tickets. When Casey's younger brother Martin Charles Casey wanted to enter West Point, Griffin directly appointed him to the class of 1920 without having to pass the examination. Martin served with the [[coastal artillery]] for eleven years before being medically discharged due to [[migraine]] headaches on 30 November 1931. Martin later graduated from Stanford Law School and became a successful lawyer.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=5\\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Cullum|1940|p=477}}</ref> Both brothers acquired the nickname \\\"Pat\\\" at West Point.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=98}}</ref>\\n\\n==World War I==\\nBecause of the United States' entry into [[World War I]], Casey's class graduated early on 12 June 1918.

Casey took over the task of preparing a voluminous report on flood control. The Corps of Engineers was criticized by the Pittsburgh Flood Control Commission for over-engineering, in planning for a \\\"flood that had never happened and never would happen\\\", and the report was shelved. However, [[Pittsburgh Flood of 1936|in 1936 the flood did happen]]. The report was then dusted off and its recommendations were adopted. The [[Flood Control Act of 1936]] assigned responsibility for flood control to the Corps of Engineers and other Federal agencies.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=76\\u201379}}</ref> Casey was also responsible for construction at Deadman Island Lock and Dam (now called the [[Dashields Locks and Dam]]) on the [[Ohio River]].<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1929|pp=444\\u2013451}}</ref>\\n\\nIn September 1929 Casey was assigned to the Rivers and Harbors Section of the Office of the Chief of Engineers in [[Washington, DC]].

A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new [[triangular division]], 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the [[cantonment]] areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=347\\u2013354}}</ref> Casey was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on 8 April 1941.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. xiii\\\"/>\\n\\nOn the afternoon of Thursday, 17 July 1941, Somervell summoned Casey and Bergstrom and gave them a new special project: the design of an enormous office complex to house the [[United States Department of War|War Department's]] 40,000-person staff together in one building. Somervell gave them until 09:00 on Monday morning to design the building, which he envisaged as a modern, four-story structure with no elevators, on the site of the old [[Hoover Field|Washington Hoover Airport]].  This would ultimately become [[The Pentagon]], the largest office building in the world.  Over that \\\"very busy weekend\\\", Casey, Bergstrom and their staff roughed out the design for a four-story, five-sided structure with a floor area of {{convert|5100000|sqft|sqm}}\\u2014twice that of the [[Empire State Building]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=431 }}</ref> The estimated cost was $35 million.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=432}}</ref> [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D.

Casey.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Major General Hugh J. Casey at his desk in Brisbane|alt=A name plaque reads: \\\"Maj. Gen. Hugh J. Casey\\\". The wall behind him is covered in huge map of New Guinea.]]\\nIn [[Australia]], Casey became Chief Engineer at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ), [[Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA). He faced enormous engineering challenges. Most of [[New Guinea]] consisted of mountains and jungle, with very few airstrips, ports or roads. All of these had to be developed to support operations. To provide additional expertise in construction, Casey had [[Leif Sverdrup]] assigned to his staff as chief of the Construction Section, with the rank of colonel. As U.S. Army engineers were few, Casey worked closely with his [[Australian Army]] counterpart at [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]]'s Allied Land Forces headquarters, [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[Clive Steele]]. Construction activities in Australia were also undertaken by civilians of the [[Allied Works Council]]. Casey attempted to coordinate the activities of the various agencies. He had to fend off attempts by the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was Casey able to control their activities.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=130\\u2013137}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey's initial need was for engineer units to accomplish the daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of [[tractor]]s, [[grader]]s, [[concrete mixer]]s and [[welding]] equipment. In the absence of a proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.\\n<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=260\\u2013}}</ref>\\n\\nIn September 1942, MacArthur decided to outflank Japanese troops on the [[Kokoda Trail]] by sending an American [[regimental combat team]] over the [[Owen Stanley Range]]. Two alternate means of crossing the mountains seemed possible. One, the [[Kapa Kapa Trail]] was known to climb to elevations above {{convert|9000|ft|m}} and present formidable obstacles. Casey and Sverdrup took charge of investigating the Abau Trail. They reached Abau on 18 September. Casey explored the harbor, taking depth soundings from a native canoe. Sverdrup set out for Jaure with a party of one American, two Australians from the [[Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit]], ten native police from the [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary|Royal Papuan Constabulary]] and 26 native carriers. After eight days on the trail, scaling heights of {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, Sverdrup concluded that it would not be practical for troops to traverse the route and turned back. Meanwhile, Casey had concluded that the harbor was too shallow even for [[lighter (barge)|lighters]]. However, the trip was not a total loss, for Sverdrup had sighted a plateau north of the Owen Stanley Range suitable for airstrips, allowing troops to be flown across the Owen Stanley Range.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=178\\u2013180}}</ref> Casey was awarded the [[Silver Star]].<ref name=\\\"medals\\\"/>\\n\\nIn New Guinea, logistics and construction activities were coordinated by task force engineer staffs. These were often hastily assembled and had not always been able to meet the demands imposed by base development in such a challenging theater of operations. The scale of operations in the Philippines was much greater, so for this purpose the Army Service Command (ASCOM) was formed in Brisbane on 23 July 1944. Casey was appointed to command ASCOM. In his absence, Sverdrup became MacArthur's chief engineer. Although part of [[USASOS]], ASCOM operated under the control of [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]], moving as far forward as combat operations allowed, developed new bases, and operated them until [[USASOS]] was ready to take over, at which point the units under ASCOM simply reverted to USASOS, allowing a seamless transfer of command.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|p=571}}</ref> For the [[Battle of Leyte]] Casey's ASCOM had 43,000 men, of whom 21,000 were engineers.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|p=575}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey and some members of his staff came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM headquarters arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at [[Tacloban City|Tacloban]], and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=579\\u2013581}}</ref> Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and it was decided to abandon their development and construct a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. The need to get aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General [[Walter Krueger]] agreed to move his headquarters.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=583\\u2013584}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey had intended to come ashore on the first day of the [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|landing at Lingayen Gulf]] in January 1945 but was delayed a day because the destroyer he was traveling on had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon Base Section (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=598\\u2013601}}</ref> For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]]. He was subsequently awarded a bronze [[oak leaf cluster]] to his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.<ref name=\\\"medals\\\"/>\\n\\nCasey hoped to become [[Chief of Engineers]] when Lieutenant General [[Raymond A. Wheeler]] retired in 1948, but President [[Harry S. Truman]] passed him over in favor of the Missouri River Division Engineer, Major General [[Lewis A. Pick]]. Instead, Casey remained in Japan as MacArthur's Chief Engineer until Casey's retirement on 31 December 1949.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=270\\u2013271}}</ref> He edited ''Engineers of the Southwest Pacific'', a seven-volume series about their wartime service.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. x\\\"/> He received a number of foreign awards for his service, including the [[Distinguished Service Star]] from the Philippines, the [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] from Australia, the Commander of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] from the Netherlands, and the Officer of [[L\\u00e9gion d'honneur]] from France.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=xi\\u2013xv}}</ref>\\n\\n==Later life==\\nCasey was Chairman of the [[New York City Transit Authority]] from 1953 to 1955, and served in various positions with [[Schenley Industries]] from 1951 until his retirement in 1965. He was a member of a number of professional societies, and civic organizations.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=xv}}</ref> He died of a heart attack on 30 August 1981 at the Veterans Administration Hospital at [[White River Junction, Vermont]], survived by his wife Dorothy and his son Keith. His other son, Hugh, had been killed in an air crash during the [[Korean War]]. Father and son were buried adjacent to each other in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref name=\\\"Arlington\\\">{{citation |url=https://ancexplorer.army.mil/publicwmv/#/arlington-national/search/results/1/CgVjYXNleRIEaHVnaA--/|title=ANC Explorer|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery}}</ref> In August 1982,  a new building at the Humphreys Engineer Center at Fort Belvoir was  dedicated in his honor by Dorothy and the Chief of Engineers, Lieutenant General [[Joseph K.

It has been struck intermittently since 1820, though as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse, [[Benedetto Pistrucci]]'s portrayal of [[St George and the Dragon]], which has traditionally been used on the [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]], or one-pound gold coin.\\n\\nThe five-pound piece was one of the original denominations of gold coins authorised as part of the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]]. It was not struck until 1820, and then only as a [[pattern coin]]. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction of [[Una and the Lion]] by [[William Wyon]]. Although the Una coin was for sale for almost half a century at the [[Royal Mint]], only about 400 are believed to have been struck.\\n\\nIn 1887, it was struck for the first time for circulation, and this also took place in 1893 and 1902, though few actually circulated; examples struck in 1911 were only available as part of a [[proof set]]. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in very small numbers at the [[Sydney Mint]], with examples bearing its [[mint mark]] S. The examples struck in preparation for the coinage of [[Edward VIII]] are highly prized; one sold in 2021 for \\u00a31,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.\\n\\nSince 1980, the five-pound gold piece has been struck in most years by the Royal Mint for sale to collectors and holders of [[bullion]]. Although generally featuring Pistrucci's design, commemorative versions have been issued, such as in 2022, as a memorial following the [[death of Elizabeth II]], featuring the bust of her son and successor, [[Charles III]].\\n\\n== Origins ==\\n{{for|further information regarding the beginnings and history of the modern sovereign coinage, as well as discussion of the St George and dragon reverse design|Sovereign (British coin)}}\\n{{Featured article}}\\n\\nThe [[Five Guineas (British coin)|five guinea]] gold coin started out in 1668 as a coin worth one hundred [[shilling (English coin)|shillings]] (five pounds), and was sometimes called a five-pound coin. This was before the fluctuating value of the [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]] settled at twenty-one [[shilling (British coin)|shillings]] in 1717. According to Richard Lobel, in his ''Coincraft's Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins'', there is some argument that the five-pound piece issued after the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]] was merely a continuation of the earlier coin, which had last been struck in 1753. However, Lobel separates the two series in his catalogue.{{sfn|Lobel|pp=421, 426\\u2013427}}\\n\\nAfter the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], by the [[Coinage Act 1816]], placed Britain officially on the [[gold standard]], with the pound to be defined as a given quantity of gold. Almost every speaker supported having a coin valued at twenty shillings, rather than continuing to use the guinea.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=52\\u201355}} One reason for the introduction of gold coinage based on the sovereign was that its value, equal to one pound sterling, was more convenient than the guinea, equal to twenty-one shillings.{{sfn|Seaby|p=147}} Nevertheless, the Coinage Act did not specify which coins the Mint should strike.{{sfn|Seaby|pp=116\\u2013117}}\\n\\nA committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] recommended gold coins of ten shillings, twenty shillings, [[double sovereign|two pounds]] and five pounds be issued, and this was accepted by [[George, Prince Regent]] on 3{{nbs}}August 1816.{{sfn|Marsh|p=7}} The twenty-shilling piece was named a sovereign, with the resurrection of [[sovereign (English coin)|the old name]] possibly promoted by antiquarians with [[numismatic]] interests.{{sfn|Clancy|p=57}} The sovereign and [[half sovereign]] were both first issued in 1817, but there was initially no striking of the two larger coins.{{sfn|Spink 2004|pp=389\\u2013390}} Since 1754, there had been no issuance of coins more valuable than a guinea intended for general circulation; the need for higher value tender had been met by bank notes.{{sfn|Bull|p=3}} The [[St George and the dragon]] design was suggested as an appropriate motif for the sovereign by its creator, [[Benedetto Pistrucci]], based on a [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] he had carved.{{sfn|Clancy|p=58}}\\n\\n== Early issues ==\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = 1820 five pounds obverse.jpeg\\n | image2 = 1820 five pounds reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = George III five-pound piece\\n | alt1 = Gold coin showing a man's bust\\n| alt2= Gold coin showing a naked man, intended to be a knight, battling a dragon\\n}}\\nThe first striking of the five-pound denomination after the coinage reform was in 1820 as a [[pattern coin]], depicting [[George III]] ({{reign|1760|1820}}). The obverse shows the right-facing bust of the king with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|GEORGIUS III D G BRITANNIAR REX F D}}}} (George III by the grace of God king of the Britains, defender of the faith) and the date, while the reverse shows Pistrucci's George and dragon design with no legend or date. This design had first appeared on the sovereign in 1817, surrounded by a [[Order of the Garter|Garter]].{{sfn|Lobel|p=453}} The design has Pistrucci's surname at the lower left, with the initials of the master of the Mint, [[William Wellesley-Pole]], near the broken spear.{{sfn|Bull|p=2}}\\n\\nLobel, in describing the 1820 five-pound piece, noted that on a copy of G. F. Crowther's 1887 book, ''A Guide to English Pattern Coins'' presented to an unknown person with the publisher's compliments, there is a pencil notation that work on the 1820 piece was completed a few days before George III's death, and after Pistrucci, walking home on the day the king died, heard church bells announcing the demise. He then returned to the [[Royal Mint]] and instructed that some five-pound coins be struck the next morning. Lobel described this as a \\\"fascinating episode of numismatic history\\\".{{sfn|Lobel|p=717}} The numismatist [[Edward Hawkins (numismatist)|Edward Hawkins]], writing in 1850, also wrote dramatically, describing what he deemed heroic efforts to ensure that the pattern double sovereigns and five-pound coins were actually struck before the king died, but [[William John Hocking]] and others have since studied the matter, concluding the coinage dies were not completed until after the king's death on 29 January. The approximately 25 specimens were distributed among Royal Mint officials, prominent numismatists and other important people of the day, as well as given to the Royal Mint and [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Bull|pp=3\\u20134}} One sold in October 2021 for about \\u00a3635,000.{{sfn|Bull|p=6}}\\n\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = 1826 five pounds obverse.jpg\\n | image2 = 1826 five pounds reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = George IV five-pound piece\\n | alt1 = Gold coin showing a man's bust\\n| alt2= Gold coin showing a heraldic shield\\n}}\\nThe next appearance of the denomination was in the reign of [[George IV]] ({{reign|1820|1830}}), in 1826, included in the [[proof set]] of that year. One piece is known dated 1829. The obverse shows the left-facing bust of the king with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA}}}} (George IV by the grace of God&nbsp;...) while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a mantle cape with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF}}}} (King of the Britains, defender of the faith). The 1826 coin has the edge inscription {{lang|la|{{small|DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI SEPTIMO}}}} (An ornament and a safeguard; seventh year of the reign), while the 1829 coin has a plain edge. No five-pound coins were issued during the reign of [[William IV]] ({{reign|1830|1837}}).{{sfn|Lobel|p=427}}\\n\\n==Victoria five-pound coins==\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = Una and lion obverse.jpeg\\n | image2 = Una and lion reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = \\\"Una and the Lion\\\" piece\\n | alt1 = Gold coin showing a woman's bust\\n| alt2= Gold coin showing a woman leading a lion\\n}}\\nThe next coin of this value did not appear until early in the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] ({{reign|1837|1901}}), when what Lobel deems one of the most famous and attractive of all British coins was produced. This piece, known as the ''[[Una and the Lion]]'' coin, is described by him as having \\\"cult status\\\".{{sfn|Lobel|p=427}} Una and the Lion appear in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s 16th century epic ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''. The obverse shows the young head of the queen, facing left with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|VICTORIA D G BRITANNIARUM REGINA F D}}}} (Victoria by the grace of God queen of the Britains, defender of the faith), while the reverse shows her as Una leading the lion to the left, with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|DIRIGE DEUS GRESSUS MEOS}}}} (May the Lord direct my steps), though some coins say {{lang|la|{{small|DIRIGIT DEUS GRESSUS MEOS}}}}, thus \\\"The Lord directs my steps\\\" \\u2013 with the date MDCCCXXXIX (1839) in the [[exergue]] under the lion. The edge may either have the inscription {{lang|la|{{small|DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI TERTIO}}}} (an ornament and a safeguard; in the third year of the reign) or be plain. These coins were struck on demand and were sold by the Royal Mint until 1886; there are a number of varieties and a total mintage of perhaps 400.{{sfn|Bair|pp=46\\u201347}} A specimen in exceptional condition sold in 2021 for US$1.44 million (\\u00a31.04 million).{{sfn|Bair|p=50}}\\n\\nPistrucci's George and dragon depiction returned to the five-pound coin in 1887, as part of the [[Jubilee coinage]], with an obverse by [[Joseph Boehm]].{{sfn|Lobel|p=427}} The new coin bears the wording {{lang|la|{{small|VICTORIA D G BRITT REG F D}}}} (Victoria by the grace of God queen of the Britains, defender of the faith).{{sfn|Bull|p=231}} The abbreviated form of {{lang|la|Britanniarum}} is rendered as {{lang|la|{{small|BRITT}}}} rather than with a single \\\"T\\\": [[Gladstone]], a classical scholar as well as a politician, had pointed out that the abbreviation of a Latin plural noun should end with a doubled consonant.{{sfn|Skillern|p=31}}\\n\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = 1887-S five pounds obverse.jpeg\\n | image2 = 1887-S five pounds reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = The rare 1887 five-pound piece from the [[Sydney Mint]].

The Royal Mint had decided to make as few changes as possible for King Edward's coinage, and the Pistrucci reverse continued for the gold coins. Five-pound coins were issued both at face value and in the proof sets issued to commemorate the [[coronation of Edward VII]]. The legend on the obverse reads {{lang|la|{{small|EDWARDVS VII D G BRITT OMN REX F D IND IMP.}}}} (Edward VII, by the grace of God king of all the Britains, defender of the faith, emperor of India).

The new king wanted his profile to face left on the new coinage, the same way as his father, which would break a tradition to reverse the direction on the commencement of a new reign which dated back to 1660. Following extensive correspondence between the king and the [[chancellor of the exchequer]], [[Neville Chamberlain]], Edward got his way, and pattern coins bearing a left-facing bust of the king by [[Thomas Humphrey Paget]] were struck. The Pistrucci reverse was used, but [[Abdication of Edward VIII|the king's abdication]] in December 1936 ended the preparations. Edward later requested a set of the pattern coins prepared for him, but was refused by his brother and successor, [[George VI]] ({{reign|1936|1952}}).

Its name is the [[latin]]ization of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[krater]]'', a type of [[cup]] used to water down [[wine]]. One of the 48 constellations listed by the second-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], it depicts a cup that has been associated with the god [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] and is perched on the back of [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] the water snake.\\n\\nThere is no [[star]] brighter than third [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] in the constellation. Its two brightest stars, [[Delta Crateris]] of magnitude 3.56 and [[Alpha Crateris]] of magnitude 4.07, are ageing orange [[giant star]]s that are cooler and larger than the [[Sun]]. [[Beta Crateris]] is a [[binary star]] system composed of a white giant star and a [[white dwarf]]. Seven star systems have been found to host [[Exoplanet|planets]]. A few notable [[galaxies]], including [[Crater 2]] and [[NGC 3981]], and a famous [[quasar]] lie within the borders of the constellation.\\n\\n==Mythology==\\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Noctua, Corvus, Crater, Sextans Urani\\u00e6, Hydra, Felis, Lupus, Centaurus, Antlia Pneumatica, Argo Navis, and Pyxis Nautica.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Corvus, Crater, and other constellations seen around Hydra, from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).

Demiphon declared that he would choose a maiden by lottery, but he did not include his own daughters. One nobleman, Mastusius, objected, forcing Demiphon to sacrify his daughter. Later, Mastusius killed Demiphon's daughters and tricked the ruler in drinking a cup containing a mixture of their blood and wine.

It is a [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] that is [[density|denser]] than most common materials. Lead is [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness#Intermediate hardness|soft]] and [[malleable]], and also has a relatively low [[melting point]]. When freshly cut, lead is a shiny gray with a hint of blue. It [[tarnish]]es to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any [[stable nuclide|stable element]] and three of its [[isotope]]s are endpoints of major nuclear [[decay chain]]s of heavier elements.\\n\\nLead is a relatively unreactive [[post-transition metal]]. Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its [[amphoteric]] nature; lead and [[lead oxide]]s react with [[acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|bases]], and it tends to form [[covalent bond]]s. [[Compounds of lead]] are usually found in the +2 [[oxidation state]] rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the [[carbon group]]. Exceptions are mostly limited to [[organolead compound]]s. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to [[catenation|bond with itself]]; it can form chains and polyhedral structures.\\n\\nSince lead is easily extracted from its [[ore]]s, prehistoric people in the Near East [[metals of antiquity|were aware of it]]. [[Galena]] is a principal ore of lead which often bears silver.  Interest in silver helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in [[ancient Rome]]. Lead production declined after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] and did not reach comparable levels until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Lead played a crucial role in the development of the [[printing press]], as [[movable type]] could be relatively easily cast from lead alloys.{{sfn|Theodore Low De Vinne|1899|pp=9\\u201336}} In 2014, the annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, [[ductility]] and relative inertness to [[oxidation]] make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, [[lead\\u2013acid batteries|batteries]], bullets and [[lead shot|shot]], weights, [[solder]]s, [[pewter]]s, [[fusible alloy]]s, [[lead paint|white paints]], [[leaded gasoline]], and [[lead shielding|radiation shield]]ing.\\n\\nLead is a [[neurotoxin]] that accumulates in soft tissues and bones. It damages the [[nervous system]] and interferes with the function of biological [[enzyme]]s, causing [[neurological disorder]]s ranging from behavioral problems to brain damage, and also affects general health, cardiovascular, and renal systems. [[lead poisoning|Lead's toxicity]] was first documented by ancient Greek and Roman writers, who noted some of the symptoms of lead poisoning, but became widely recognized in Europe in the late 19th century.\\n\\n== Physical properties ==\\n\\n=== Atomic ===\\nA lead [[atom]] has 82 [[electron]]s, arranged in an [[electron configuration]] of &#91;[[xenon|Xe]]&#93;4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>6p<sup>2</sup>. The sum of lead's first and second [[ionization energy|ionization energies]]\\u2014the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons\\u2014is close to that of [[tin]], lead's upper neighbor in the [[carbon group]]. This is unusual; ionization energies generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer electrons become more distant from the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]], and more [[shielding effect|shielded]] by smaller orbitals.\\n\\nThe sum of the first four ionization energies of lead exceeds that of tin,{{sfn|Lide|2005|p=10-179}} contrary to what [[periodic trends]] would predict. This is explained by [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which become significant in heavier atoms,{{sfn|Pyykk\\u00f6|1988|pp=563\\u2013594}} which contract s and p orbitals such that lead's 6s electrons have larger binding energies than its 5s electrons.{{sfn|Claudio|Godwin|Magyar|2002|pp=1\\u2013144}} A consequence is the so-called [[inert pair effect]]: the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding, stabilising the +2 [[oxidation state]] and making the distance between nearest atoms in [[crystalline]] lead unusually long.{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=36}}\\n\\nLead's lighter carbon group [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] form stable or metastable [[allotrope]]s with the tetrahedrally coordinated and [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] [[diamond cubic]] structure. The energy levels of their outer [[s-orbital|s-]] and [[p-orbital]]s are close enough to allow mixing into four [[orbital hybridisation|hybrid]] sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=226\\u2013227, 374}} Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms [[metallic bonding|metallic bonds]] in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions. Lead consequently has a [[cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] structure{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=867}} like the similarly sized{{sfn|Slater|1964}} [[divalent]] metals [[calcium]] and [[strontium]].{{sfn|Considine|Considine|2013|pp=501, 2970}}{{efn|The tetrahedral allotrope of tin is called \\u03b1- or gray tin and is stable only at or below 13.2&nbsp;\\u00b0C (55.8&nbsp;\\u00b0F). The stable form of tin above this temperature is called \\u03b2- or white tin and has a distorted face centered cubic (tetragonal) structure which can be derived by compressing the tetrahedra of gray tin along their cubic axes. White tin effectively has a structure intermediate between the regular tetrahedral structure of gray tin, and the regular face centered cubic structure of lead, consistent with the general trend of increasing metallic character going down any representative group.{{sfn|Parth\\u00e9|1964|p=13}}}}{{efn|A [[quasicrystal]]line [[thin-film]] allotrope of lead, with pentagonal symmetry, was reported in 2013.

Its conductivity was not recorded.{{sfn|Sharma|Nozawa|Smerdon|Nugent|2013}}{{sfn|Sharma|Smerdon|Nugent|Ribeiro|2014|p=174710}}}}{{efn|Diamond cubic structures with lattice parameters around the lattice parameter of silicon exists both in thin lead and tin films, and in massive lead and tin, freshly solidified in vacuum of ~5 x 10<sup>\\u22126</sup> Torr.

The high number of isotopes is consistent with lead's [[atomic number]] being even.{{efn|An even number of either protons or neutrons generally increases the nuclear stability of isotopes, compared to isotopes with odd numbers. No elements with odd atomic numbers have more than two stable isotopes; even-numbered elements have multiple stable isotopes, with tin (element 50) having the highest number of isotopes of all elements, ten.{{sfn|IAEA - Nuclear Data Section|2017}} See [[Even and odd atomic nuclei]] for more details.}} Lead has a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] of protons (82), for which the [[nuclear shell model]] accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus.{{sfn|Stone|1997}} Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, which may explain why lead-208 is extraordinarily stable.{{sfn|Stone|1997}}\\n\\nWith its high atomic number, lead is the heaviest element whose natural isotopes are regarded as stable; lead-208 is the heaviest stable nucleus. (This distinction formerly fell to [[bismuth]], with an atomic number of 83, until its only [[primordial nuclide|primordial isotope]], bismuth-209, was found in 2003 to decay very slowly.){{efn|The half-life found in the experiment was 1.9{{e|19}} years.{{sfn|de Marcillac|Coron|Dambier|Leblanc|2003|pp=876\\u201378}} A kilogram of natural bismuth would have an activity value of approximately 0.003 [[becquerel]]s (decays per second).

The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. The inert pair effect is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity, such as carbon in organolead compounds. In these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization is still energetically favorable. Lead, like carbon, is predominantly tetravalent in such compounds.{{sfn|Kaupp|2014|pp=9\\u201310}}\\n\\nThere is a relatively large difference in the electronegativity of lead(II) at 1.87 and lead(IV) at 2.33.

Typically they are removed in a series of [[Pyrometallurgy|pyrometallurgical processes]]. The melt is treated in a [[reverberatory furnace]] with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the impurities except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float to the [[dross|top of the melt]] and are skimmed off.{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=25}}{{sfn|Primary Lead Refining}} Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the [[Parkes process]], in which zinc is added to lead. Zinc, which is immiscible in lead, dissolves the silver and gold. The zinc solution can be separated from the lead, and the silver and gold retrieved.{{sfn|Primary Lead Refining}}{{sfn|Pauling|1947}} De-silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the [[Betterton\\u2013Kroll process]], treating it with metallic calcium and [[magnesium]]. The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off.{{sfn|Primary Lead Refining}}\\n\\nAlternatively to the pyrometallurgical processes, very pure lead can be obtained by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the [[Betts electrolytic process|Betts process]]. Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of lead [[fluorosilicate]] (PbSiF<sub>6</sub>). Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution.{{sfn|Primary Lead Refining}}{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=34}} This is a high-cost process and thus mostly reserved for refining bullion containing high percentages of impurities.{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=23}}\\n\\n==== Direct process ====\\nIn this process, lead bullion and [[slag]] is obtained directly from lead concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming lead monoxide. Carbon (as coke or [[coal gas]]{{efn|Gaseous by-product of the coking process, containing [[carbon monoxide]], hydrogen and [[methane]]; used as a fuel.}}) is added to the molten charge along with [[flux (metallurgy)|fluxing agents]]. The lead monoxide is thereby reduced to metallic lead, in the midst of a slag rich in lead monoxide.{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=17}}\\n\\nIf the input is rich in lead, as much as 80% of the original lead can be obtained as bullion; the remaining 20% forms a slag rich in lead monoxide. For a low-grade feed, all of the lead can be oxidized to a high-lead slag.{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=17}} Metallic lead is further obtained from the high-lead (25\\u201340%) slags via submerged fuel combustion or injection, reduction assisted by an electric furnace, or a combination of both.{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=17}}\\n\\n==== Alternatives ====\\nResearch on a cleaner, less energy-intensive lead extraction process continues; a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste, or the alternatives result in a high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. [[Hydrometallurgy|Hydrometallurgical]] extraction, in which [[anode]]s of impure lead are immersed into an [[electrolyte]] and pure lead is deposited ([[Electrowinning|electrowound]]) onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential, but is not currently economical except in cases where electricity is very cheap.{{sfn|Thornton|Rautiu|Brush|2001|pp=52\\u201353}}\\n\\n=== Secondary ===\\n{{Further|Battery recycling#Lead\\u2013acid batteries}}\\nSmelting, which is an essential part of the primary production, is often skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead has undergone significant oxidation.{{sfn|Thornton|Rautiu|Brush|2001|p=56}} The process is similar to that of primary production in either a [[blast furnace]] or a [[rotary furnace]], with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields: blast furnaces produce hard lead (10% antimony) while reverberatory and rotary kiln furnaces produce semisoft lead (3\\u20134% antimony).{{sfn|United States Environmental Protection Agency|2010|p=1}}\\n\\nThe [[ISASMELT]] process is a more recent smelting method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead\\u2013acid batteries (containing lead sulfate and lead oxides) has its sulfate removed by treating it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity.{{sfn|Thornton|Rautiu|Brush|2001|p=57}} Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination.{{sfn|Thornton|Rautiu|Brush|2001|p=57}}\\n\\nOf the sources of lead for recycling, lead\\u2013acid batteries are the most important; lead pipe, sheet, and cable sheathing are also significant.{{sfn|Thornton|Rautiu|Brush|2001|p=56}}\\n\\n== Applications ==\\n[[File:Lead shielding.jpg|thumb|left|Bricks of lead (alloyed with 4% antimony) are used as radiation shielding.{{sfn|Street|Alexander|1998|p=181}}|alt=A closed structure of black bricks]]\\n\\nContrary to popular belief, pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made from lead.

Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the [[Deccan Plateau|Southern Deccan]] Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the [[Chennakeshava Temple, Belur|Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]].<ref name=\\\"kdravida\\\">Hardy (1995), pp. 243\\u2013245</ref><ref name=\\\"great\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 47, p. 59, p. 87</ref> These three temples were accorded UNESCO world heritage site status in 2023.<ref name=\\\"unesco\\\">{{cite web|title=Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysalas|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1670 |author=UNESCO World Heritage Convention|publisher=\\u00a9 UNESCO World Heritage Centre 1992-2023|work=UNESCO|access-date=2023-10-03}}</ref> Other examples of Hoysala craftsmanship are the temples at [[Veera Narayana Temple, Belavadi|Belavadi]], [[Amrutesvara Temple, Amruthapura|Amruthapura]], [[Lakshminarayana Temple (Hosaholalu)|Hosaholalu]], [[Nageshvara-Chennakeshava Temple complex, Mosale|Mosale]], [[Ishvara Temple (Arasikere)|Arasikere]], [[Mallikarjuna Temple, Basaralu|Basaralu]], [[Brahmeshvara Temple, Kikkeri|Kikkeri]] and [[Lakshmi Narasimha Temple, Nuggehalli|Nuggehalli]].<ref name=\\\"hardy_list\\\">Hardy (1995), p. 320, p. 321, p. 324, p. 325, p. 329, p. 332, p. 334, p. 339, p. 340, p. 346</ref><ref name=\\\"foekema_list\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 53, p. 37, p. 71, p. 81, p. 41, p. 43, p. 83</ref> Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] influence while the impact of [[Southern India]]n style is more distinct.<ref name=\\\"distinct\\\">[[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] in Kamath (2001), p. 134</ref>\\n\\nTemples built prior to Hoysala independence in the mid-12th century reflect significant Western Chalukya influences, while later temples retain some features salient to [[Western Chalukya architecture]] but have additional inventive decoration and ornamentation, features unique to Hoysala artisans. Some three hundred temples are known to survive in present-day Karnataka state and many more are mentioned in inscriptions, though only about seventy have been documented. The greatest concentration of these are in the [[Malnad]] (hill) districts, the native home of the Hoysala kings.<ref name=\\\"nativehome\\\">Hardy (1995), p. 244</ref>\\n\\nHoysala architecture is classified by the influential scholar [[Adam Hardy]] as part of the ''Karnata Dravida'' tradition, a trend within [[Dravidian architecture]] in the Deccan that is distinct from the [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] style of further south.  Other terms for the tradition are [[Vesara]], and Chalukya architecture, divided into early [[Badami Chalukya architecture]] and the [[Western Chalukya architecture]] which immediately preceded the Hoysalas. The whole tradition covers a period of about seven centuries began in the 7th century under the patronage of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] of [[Badami]], developed further under the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta]] during the 9th and 10th centuries and the [[Western Chalukya Empire|Western Chalukyas]] (or Later Chalukyas) of [[Basavakalyan]] in the 11th and 12th centuries. Its final development stage and transformation into an independent style was during the rule of the Hoysalas in the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref name=\\\"flourish\\\">Hardy (1995), pp. 6\\u20137, section ''Introduction-Dynasties and Periods''</ref> Medieval inscriptions displayed prominently at temple locations give information about donations made toward the maintenance of the temple, details of consecration and on occasion, even architectural details.<ref name=\\\"epigraph\\\">Foekema (2003), p. 18</ref>\\n\\n==Temple deities==\\n[[Image:Relief sculpture of the Hindu god Narayana with his consort Lakshmi (Lakshminarayana) in the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Vishnu with Lakshmi (''Lakshminarayana'') at [[Halebidu]]]]\\n[[Image:Relief sculpture of the Hindu god Shiva with his consort Parvati riding Nandi the bull in the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Shiva, Parvati, Nandi at [[Halebidu]]]]\\n\\nHinduism is a combination of secular and sacred beliefs, rituals, daily practices and traditions that has evolved over the course of over two thousand years and embodies complex symbolism combining the natural world with philosophy.\\n\\nHindu temples began as simple shrines housing a deity and by the time of the Hoysalas had evolved into well-articulated edifices in which worshippers sought transcendence of the daily world. Hoysala temples were not limited to any specifically organised tradition of Hinduism and encouraged pilgrims of different Hindu [[devotional movements]]. The Hoysalas usually dedicated their temples to [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]] (two of the popular Hindu gods), but they occasionally built some temples dedicated to the Jain faith as well. Worshippers of Shiva are called [[Shaivism|Shaivas]] and worshippers of Vishnu are called [[Vaishnava]]s.<ref name=\\\"worship\\\">Foekema (1996), pp. 19\\u201320, chapter-''The dedications and names of temples''</ref><ref name=\\\"iconography\\\">Hardy (1995), p. 245</ref> While King [[Vishnuvardhana]] and his descendants were Vaishnava by faith,<ref name=\\\"vaishnava\\\">Kamath (2001), p. 132</ref> records show that the Hoysalas maintained religious harmony by building as many temples dedicated to Shiva as they did to Vishnu.<ref name=\\\"equal\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 19</ref>\\n\\nMost of these temples have secular features with broad themes depicted in their sculptures. This can be seen in the famous [[Chennakeshava Temple, Belur|Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] dedicated to Vishnu and in the [[Hoysaleswara temple]] at [[Halebidu]] dedicated to Shiva. The Kesava temple at [[Somanathapura]] is different in that its ornamentation is strictly Vaishnava. Generally Vaishnava temples are dedicated to [[Keshava]] (or to Chennakeshava, meaning \\\"Beautiful Vishnu\\\") while a small number are dedicated to Lakshminarayana and Lakshminarasimha (Narayana and Narasimha both being [[Avatar]]s, or physical manifestations, of Vishnu) with [[Lakshmi]], consort of Vishnu, seated at his feet. Temples dedicated to Vishnu are always named after the deity.<ref name=\\\"ramayana1\\\"/>\\n\\nThe [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] temples have a [[Lingam|Shiva linga]], symbol of fertility and the universal symbol of Shiva, in the [[shrine]]. The names of Shiva temples can end with the suffix ''eshwara'' meaning \\\"Lord of\\\". The name \\\"Hoysaleswara\\\", for instance, means \\\"Lord of Hoysala\\\". The temple can also be named after the devotee who commissioned the construction of the temple, an example being the Bucesvara temple at Koravangala, named after the devotee Buci.<ref name=\\\"name\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 19\\u201320</ref> The most striking sculptural decorations are the horizontal rows of mouldings with detailed [[relief]], and intricately carved images of gods, goddesses and their attendants on the outer temple wall panels.<ref name=\\\"horizontal\\\">Kamath (2001), p. 134</ref>\\n\\nThe [[Doddagaddavalli]] Lakshmi Devi (\\\"Goddess of Wealth\\\") Temple is an exception as it is dedicated to neither Vishnu nor Shiva. The defeat of the Jain [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] (of present-day south Karnataka) by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of [[Vaishnava|Vaishnava Hinduism]] and [[Virashaivism]] in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in [[Jainism]].<ref name=\\\"jain\\\">Kamath (2001), pp 112, 132</ref> However, two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. The Hoysalas built [[Jain]] temples to satisfy the needs of its Jain population, a few of which have survived in [[Halebidu]] containing icons of Jain [[tirthankaras]]. They constructed stepped wells called ''Pushkarni'' or ''Kalyani'', the ornate [[temple tank|tank]] at Hulikere being an example. The tank has twelve minor shrines containing Hindu deities.<ref name=\\\"tank\\\">Foekema (1996), plate 27</ref>\\n\\nThe two main deities found in Hoysala temple sculpture are Shiva and Vishnu in their various forms and avatars (incarnations). Shiva is usually shown with four arms holding a [[trident]] and a small drum among other emblems that symbolise objects worshiped independently of the divine image with which they are associated.<ref name=\\\"Shiva\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 31, chapter:''Recognizing the most important deities''</ref> Any male icon portrayed in this way is Shiva although a female icon may sometimes be portrayed with these attributes as Shiva's consort, [[Parvati]]. Various depictions of [[Shiva]] exist: showing him naked (fully or partially), in activities such as slaying a demon ([[Andhaka]]) or dancing on the head of a slain elephant ([[Gajasura]]) and holding its skin up behind his back. He is often accompanied by his consort Parvati or shown with [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] the bull. He may be represented as [[Bhairava]], another of Shiva's many manifestations.<ref name=\\\"Shiva\\\"/>\\n\\nA male figure depicted holding certain objects such as a [[conch]] (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu.

The closed ''mantapa'' is connected to the shrines by a vestibule, a square area that also connects the shrines. Its outer walls are decorated, but as the size the vestibule is not large, this may not be a conspicuous part of the temple. The vestibule also has a short tower called the ''[[sukanasa|sukanasi]]'' or \\\"nose\\\" upon which is mounted the Hoysala emblem.

The ''vimana'' is often topped by a tower which is quite different on the outside than on the inside. Inside, the vimana is plain and square, whereas outside it is profusely decorated and can be either stellate (\\\"star-shaped\\\") or shaped as a staggered square, or feature a combination of these designs, giving it many projections and recesses that seem to multiply as the light falls on it.<ref name=\\\"cross-in-square\\\" /> Each projection and recess has a complete decorative articulation that is rhythmic and repetitive and composed of blocks and [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], obscuring the tower profile. Depending on the number of shrines (and hence on the number of towers), the temples are classified as ''ekakuta'' (one), ''dvikuta'' (two), ''trikuta'' (three), ''chatushkuta'' (four) and ''panchakuta'' (five). Most Hoysala temples are ''ekakuta'', ''dvikuta'' or ''trikuta'', the Vaishnava ones mostly being ''trikuta''.<ref name=\\\"iconography\\\">Hardy (1995), p. 245</ref><ref name=\\\"kuta\\\">Sometimes a ''trikuta'' may not literally mean \\\"three towers\\\", as only the central shrine has a tower (Foekema 1996, p. 25)</ref> There are cases where a temple is ''trikuta'' but has only one tower over the main shrine (in the middle).

Below this structure are domed roofs in a square plan, all of them much smaller and crowned with small ''kalasas''. They are mixed with other small roofs of different shapes and are ornately decorated. The tower of the shrine usually has three or four tiers of rows of decorative roofs while the tower on top of the ''sukanasi'' has one less tier, making the tower look like an extension of the main tower (Foekema calls it the \\\"nose\\\"). One decorated roof tier runs on top of the wall of a closed ''mantapa'' above the heavy eaves of an open ''mantapa'' and above the porches.<ref name=\\\"nosy\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 22, p. 28, section:''The plan of the temples''</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:Wall sculptures and molding frieze in relief in the Chennakeshava temple at Somanathapura.jpg|thumb|right|Outer wall panel with six horizontal mouldings at [[Somanathapura]]]]\\n\\nBelow the superstructure of the ''[[vimana (tower)|vimana]]'' are temple \\\"[[eave]]s\\\"<ref name=\\\"eave\\\">under the projecting roof overhanging the wall (Foekema 1996, p. 93)</ref> projecting half a meter from the wall. Below the eaves two different decorative schemes may be found, depending on whether a temple was built in the early or the later period of the empire. In the early temples built prior to the 13th century, there is one eave and below this are decorative miniature towers. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants are below these towers, followed by a set of five different mouldings forming the base of the wall. In the later temples there is a second eave running about a metre below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers placed between them. The wall images of gods are below the lower eaves, followed by six different mouldings of equal size. This is broadly termed \\\"horizontal treatment\\\".<ref name=\\\"horizontal\\\">Kamath (2001), p. 134</ref> The six mouldings at the base are divided in two sections. Going from the very base of the wall, the first horizontal layer contains a procession of elephants, above which are horsemen and then a band of foliage. The second horizontal section has depictions of the Hindu epics and ''[[Puranas|Puranic]]'' scenes executed with detail. Above this are two friezes of ''[[yali (motif)|yali]]''s or ''makara''s (imaginary beasts) and ''hamsas'' (swans).

It covers an area about 2.6 [[arcminute]]s on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in [[Angular diameter|angular size]] to a [[tennis ball]] at a distance of 100&nbsp;metres.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Big Questions The Universe |first1=Stuart |last1=Clark |publisher=Hachette UK |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84916-609-6 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVhBQAAQBAJ}}</ref> The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] over ten consecutive days between December 18 and 28, 1995.<ref name=\\\"Ferguson1998\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Hubble_image\\\" />\\n\\nThe field is so small that only a few foreground [[star]]s in the [[Milky Way]] lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are [[galaxy|galaxies]], some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image in the [[physical cosmology|study of the early universe]].\\n\\nThree years after the HDF observations were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named the [[Hubble Deep Field South]]. The similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the [[universe]] is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the [[cosmological principle]]). A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]]. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]] (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive [[astronomy|astronomical]] image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the [[Hubble eXtreme Deep Field]] (XDF) was released in 2012.\\n\\n==Conception==\\n[[File:Improvement in Hubble images after SMM1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The dramatic improvement in Hubble's imaging capabilities after corrective [[optics]] were installed encouraged attempts to obtain very deep images of distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]].]]\\n\\nOne of the key aims of the astronomers who designed the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high [[optical resolution]] to study distant galaxies to a level of detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the [[atmosphere]], Hubble avoids atmospheric [[airglow]] allowing it to take more sensitive [[Visible light|visible]] and [[ultraviolet light]] images than can be obtained with [[Astronomical seeing|seeing-limited]] ground-based telescopes (when good [[adaptive optics]] correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10&nbsp;m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from [[spherical aberration]] when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because [[Speed of light|light takes billions of years]] to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows a better understanding of how they evolve.<ref name=Ferguson1998>Ferguson et al. (1999), p.84</ref>\\n\\nAfter the spherical aberration was corrected during [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-61]] in 1993,<ref name=\\\"Trauger1994\\\">Trauger et al. (1994)</ref> the improved imaging capabilities of the telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The [[Hubble Medium Deep Survey|Medium Deep Survey]] (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.<ref>Abraham et al. (1996)</ref>\\n\\nUp to 10% of the HST's observation time is designated as Director's Discretionary (DD) Time, and is typically awarded to astronomers who wish to study unexpected transient phenomena, such as [[supernova]]e. Once Hubble's corrective optics were shown to be performing well, [[Robert Williams (astronomer)|Robert Williams]], the then-director of the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]], decided to devote a substantial fraction of his DD time during 1995 to the study of distant galaxies. A special Institute Advisory Committee recommended that the WFPC2 be used to image a \\\"typical\\\" patch of sky at a high [[galactic latitude]], using several [[optical filter]]s. A [[working group]] was set up to develop and implement the project.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\">Williams et al. (1996)</ref>\\n\\n==Target selection==\\n[[File:Hubble Deep Field location.gif|thumb|300px|The HDF is at the centre of this image of one [[degree (angle)|degree]] of sky. The Moon as seen from Earth would fill roughly one quarter of this image.]]\\n\\nThe field selected for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It had to be at a high galactic latitude because [[interstellar dust|dust]] and obscuring matter in the plane of the [[Milky Way]]'s disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes (see [[Zone of Avoidance]]). The target field had to avoid known bright sources of [[visible light]] (such as foreground stars), and [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], and [[X-ray]] emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background [[infrared cirrus]], the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of [[hydrogen]] gas ([[H I region]]s).<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nThese criteria restricted the field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble's continuous viewing zones: the areas of sky that are not [[occultation|occulted]] by the Earth or the [[moon]] during Hubble's orbit.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" /> The working group decided to concentrate on the northern continuous viewing zone, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the [[Keck telescopes]], the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] telescopes, and the [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.<ref name=\\\"north_cvz\\\">{{cite web |author=Ferguson, H. |date=1996 |url=http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/project/field.html |title=The Hubble Deep Field{{snd}}field selection |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |access-date=December 26, 2008}}</ref>\\n\\nTwenty fields satisfying these criteria were identified, from which three optimal candidate fields were selected, all within the constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. [[Radio]] snapshot observations with the VLA ruled out one of these fields because it contained a bright radio source, and the final decision between the other two was made on the basis of the availability of guide stars near the field: Hubble observations normally require a pair of nearby stars on which the telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors can lock during an exposure, but given the importance of the HDF observations, the working group required a second set of back-up guide stars. The field that was eventually selected is located at a [[right ascension]] of {{RA|12|36|49.4}} and a [[declination]] of {{DEC|+62|12|58}};<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" /><ref name=\\\"north_cvz\\\" /> it is about 2.6 [[arcminute]]s in width,<ref name=\\\"Ferguson1998\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Ferguson2000a\\\">Ferguson (2000a)</ref> or 1/12 the width of the Moon.

An important decision was to determine which [[filter (optics)|filter]]s the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with 48 filters, including [[narrowband]] filters isolating particular [[emission line]]s of [[astrophysical]] interest, and [[broadband]] filters useful for the study of the colors of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the [[throughput]] of each filter\\u2014the total proportion of light that it allows through\\u2014and the spectral coverage available. Filters with [[bandpass]]es overlapping as little as possible were desirable.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nIn the end, four broadband filters were chosen, centred at [[wavelength]]s of 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (near-[[ultraviolet]]), 450&nbsp;nm (blue light), 606&nbsp;nm (red light) and 814&nbsp;nm (near-[[infrared]]). Because the [[quantum efficiency]] of Hubble's detectors at 300&nbsp;nm wavelength is quite low, the noise in observations at this wavelength is primarily due to [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nBetween December 18 and 28, 1995\\u2014during which time Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times\\u2014342 images of the target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total exposure times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300&nbsp;nm), 33.5 hours (450&nbsp;nm), 30.3 hours (606&nbsp;nm) and 34.3 hours (814&nbsp;nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by [[cosmic ray]]s, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\n==Data processing==\\n[[File:Galaxy in each of the four wavelengths comprising the HDF.jpg|thumb|300px|A section of the HDF about 14 [[arcseconds]] across in each of the four [[wavelength]]s used to construct the final version: 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (top left), 450 nm (top right), 606 nm (bottom left) and 814 nm (bottom right)]]\\nThe production of a final combined image at each [[wavelength]] was a complex process. Bright [[pixel]]s caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by [[cosmic ray]]s in one exposure but not the other. Trails of [[space debris]] and [[artificial satellite]]s were present in the original images, and were carefully removed.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nScattered light from the Earth was evident in about a quarter of the data frames, creating a visible \\\"X\\\" pattern on the images. This was removed by taking an image affected by scattered light, aligning it with an unaffected image, and subtracting the unaffected image from the affected one. The resulting image was smoothed, and could then be subtracted from the bright frame. This procedure removed almost all of the scattered light from the affected images.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nOnce the 342 individual images were cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, they had to be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called '[[Drizzle (image processing)|drizzling]]', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 [[arcsecond]]s across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nThe data processing yielded four [[monochrome]] images (at 300&nbsp;nm, 450&nbsp;nm, 606&nbsp;nm and 814&nbsp;nm), one at each wavelength.<ref name=Ferguson1/> One image was designated as red (814&nbsp;nm), the second as green (606&nbsp;nm) and the third as blue (450&nbsp;nm), and the three images were combined to give a color image.<ref name=Hubble_image>{{cite web |publisher=NASA |date=1996 |title=Hubble's Deepest View of the Universe Unveils Bewildering Galaxies across Billions of Years |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/01/image/a/ |access-date=January 12, 2009}}</ref> Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colors in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colors of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colors corresponding to what the [[human eye]] would actually perceive.<ref name=Ferguson1>Ferguson et al.

Astronomers initially ruled out the possibility that some of the point-like objects are [[white dwarf]]s, because they are too blue to be consistent with theories of white dwarf evolution prevalent at the time.

The light from very distant galaxies is significantly affected by the [[Redshift#Expansion of space|cosmological redshift]]. While [[quasar]]s with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced.<ref name=\\\"key_findings\\\" /> The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion [[light-year]]s. Due to redshift the most distant objects in the HDF ([[Lyman-break galaxy|Lyman-break galaxies]]) are not actually visible in the Hubble images; they can only be detected in images of the HDF taken at longer wavelengths by ground-based telescopes.<ref name=Ferguson2>Ferguson et al.

It is believed that giant [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] form when spirals and irregular galaxies collide.\\n\\nThe wealth of galaxies at different stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of [[star formation]] over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies are somewhat crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8\\u201310 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.<ref name=\\\"Connolly1997\\\">Connolly et al. (1997)</ref>\\n\\nAnother important result from the HDF was the very small number of foreground stars present.

There are [[List of antbirds|more than 230 species]], known variously as antshrikes, antwrens, antvireos, fire-eyes, bare-eyes and bushbirds. They are related to the antthrushes and antpittas (family [[Formicariidae]]), the [[tapaculo]]s, the [[gnateater]]s and the [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]]. Despite some species' common names, this family is not closely related to the [[wren]]s, [[vireo]]s or [[shrike]]s.\\n\\nAntbirds are generally small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and [[rufous]] [[plumage]], which is [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] in pattern and colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches on their backs or shoulders. Most have heavy [[beak|bills]], which in many species are hooked at the tip.\\n\\nMost species live in forests, although a few are found in other habitats. Insects and other [[arthropod]]s form the most important part of their diet, although small vertebrates are occasionally taken. Most species feed in the [[understory]] and midstory of the forest, although a few feed in the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] and a few on the ground. Many join [[mixed-species foraging flock|mixed-species feeding flock]]s, and a few species are core members. To various degrees, around eighteen species specialise in [[ant follower|following]] swarms of [[army ant]]s to eat the small [[invertebrate]]s flushed by the ants, and many others may feed in this way opportunistically.\\n\\nAntbirds are [[monogamy in animals|monogamous]], mate for life, and defend [[Territory (animal)|territories]]. They usually lay two eggs in a nest that is either suspended from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of [[avian incubation|incubation]] and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After [[fledge|fledging]], each parent cares exclusively for one chick.\\n\\nThirty-eight species are threatened with extinction as a result of human activities. Antbirds are not targeted by either hunters or the pet trade. The principal threat is [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]], which causes [[habitat fragmentation]] and increased nest predation in habitat fragments.\\n\\n== Systematics ==\\n{{see also|List of antbird genera|List of antbird species}}\\nThe antbird family Thamnophilidae used to be considered  a subfamily, Thamnophilinae, within a larger family [[Formicariidae]] that included [[formicariidae|antthrush]]es and [[formicariidae|antpitta]]s. Formerly, that larger family was known as the \\\"antbird family\\\" and the Thamnophilinae were \\\"typical antbirds\\\". In this article, \\\"antbird\\\" and \\\"antbird family\\\" refer to the family Thamnophilidae.\\n\\nThamnophilidae was removed from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to recognition of differences in the structure of the breastbone ([[sternum]]) and [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]], and [[Sibley\\u2013Ahlquist taxonomy of birds|Sibley and Ahlquist's]] examination of [[DNA\\u2013DNA hybridization]].<ref>[[Charles Sibley|Sibley, C. G.]] and [[Jon E. Ahlquist|Ahlquist, J. E.]] (1990) [http://google.com/books?id=cfjAvuxL-9wC&printsec=frontcover ''Phylogeny and classification of birds'']. Yale University Press, New Haven, Conn. {{ISBN|0-300-04085-7}}.</ref><ref name = \\\"Rice\\\"/> The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or [[Tyranni|tracheophone suboscines]]), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to their relatives the antthrushes and antpittas, [[tapaculo]]s, [[gnateater]]s, and also the [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]].<ref name = \\\"Irestedt2002\\\"/> The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.<!-- needs a ref, also meaning is unclear; try writing it out as nested parentheses, then expand into words -->\\n\\nThe antbird family contains over 230 species, variously called antwrens, antvireos, antbirds and antshrikes. The names refer to the relative sizes of the birds (increasing in the order given, though with exceptions) rather than any particular resemblance to the true [[wren]]s, [[vireo]]s or [[shrike]]s. In addition, members of the genus ''Phlegopsis'' are known as [[phlegopsis|bare-eye]]s, ''Pyriglena'' as [[pyriglena|fire-eye]]s and ''Neoctantes'' and ''Clytoctantes'' as [[Clytoctantes|bushbird]]s. Although the systematics of the Thamnophilidae is based on studies from the mid-19th century, when fewer than half the present species were known, comparison of the [[myoglobin]] [[intron]] 2, [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase|GAPDH]] intron 11 and the [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]]s has largely confirmed it.<ref name = \\\"Irestedt 2004\\\"/> There are two major [[clade]]s \\u2013 most antshrikes and other larger, strong-billed species as well as ''[[Herpsilochmus]]'', versus the classical antwrens and other more slender, longer-billed species \\u2013 and the [[monophyly]] of most genera was confirmed.\\n\\nThe Thamnophilidae contains several large or very large [[genus|genera]] and numerous small or [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] ones. Several, which are difficult to assign, seem to form a third, hitherto unrecognised clade independently derived from ancestral antbirds.<ref name = \\\"Irestedt 2004\\\"/> The results also confirmed suspicions of previous researchers that some species, most notably in ''[[Myrmotherula]]'' and ''[[Myrmeciza]]'', need to be assigned to other genera. Still, due to the difficulties of sampling from such a large number of often poorly known species, the assignment of some genera is still awaiting confirmation.\\n\\n== Morphology ==\\n\\n[[File:Gymnopithys-leucaspis-001 edit2.jpg|thumb|left|The legs and feet of [[ant follower|ant-following]] antbirds are stable and adapted to gripping vertical stems and branches.

Members of this family have short rounded wings that provide good manoeuvrability when [[bird flight|flying]] in dense undergrowth. The legs are large and strong, particularly in species that are obligate [[ant-follower]]s. These species are well adapted to gripping vertical stems and [[tree|sapling]]s, which are more common than horizontal branches in the undergrowth, and thus the ability to grip them is an advantage for birds following swarms of army ants. The claws of these antbirds are longer than those of species that do not follow ants, and the soles of some species have projections that are tough and gripping when the foot is clenched. [[Tarsus (skeleton)|Tarsus]] length in antbirds is related to foraging strategy. Longer tarsi typically occur in genera such as the ''[[Thamnophilus]]'' antshrikes that forage by perch-[[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] (sitting and leaning forward to snatch insects from the branch), whereas shorter tarsi typically occur in those that catch prey on the wing, such as the ''[[Thamnomanes]]'' antshrikes.<ref name = \\\"Schulenberg\\\"/>\\n\\nMost antbirds have proportionately large, heavy [[beak|bills]].<ref name = \\\"Schulenberg\\\"/> Several genera of antshrike have a strongly hooked tip to the bill, and all antbirds have a notch or 'tooth' at the tip of the bill which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two [[genus|genera]] of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.<ref name=Lanyon/>\\n\\nThe [[plumage]] of antbirds is soft and not brightly coloured, although it is occasionally striking.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> The colour palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or patterned with barring or spots. [[Sexual dimorphism]] \\u2013 differences in plumage colour and pattern between males and females \\u2013 is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and brown colours. For example, the male [[dot-winged antwren]] is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts.<ref name = \\\"Greenberg\\\"/> In some genera, such as ''Myrmotherula'', species are better distinguished by female plumage than by male.<ref>Rice, N. H. and Hutson, A. M. (2003) \\\"Antbirds\\\". pp. 446\\u2013449 ''in'' [[Chris Perrins|Perrins, C.]] (editor). (2003). ''Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds. '' Firefly Books. {{ISBN|1-55297-777-3}}</ref> Many species of antbirds have a contrasting 'patch' of white (sometimes other colours) feathers on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. dot-winged antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in [[bluish-slate antshrike]]s and [[white-flanked antwren]]s the white patch is on the shoulder.<ref name = \\\"Munn\\\"/>\\n\\n=== Voice ===\\n[[File:Drymophila ochropyga.jpeg|thumb|[[Ochre-rumped antbird]] calling]]\\n[[File:Song of Thamnophilus doliatus.ogg|right|thumb|Song of the [[barred antshrike]]]]\\nThe [[Bird vocalization|songs and calls]] of antbirds are generally composed of repeated simple uncomplicated notes. The family is one of the suboscines (suborder [[Tyranni]]) which have simpler [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinxes]] (\\\"voiceboxes\\\") than other songbirds. Nevertheless, their songs are distinctive and species-specific, allowing field identification by ear.<ref name =\\\"HBW\\\"/> Antbirds rely on their calls for communication, as is typical of birds in dark forests. Most species have at least two types of call, the ''loudsong'' and the ''softsong''. The functions of many calls have been deduced from their context; for example some loudsongs have a [[territory (animal)|territorial purpose]] and are given when birds meet at the edges of their territories, or during the morning rounds of the territory. Pairs in neighbouring territories judge the proximity of rivals by the degradation of the song caused by interference by the environment.<ref name=Morton/> In bouts of territorial defence the male will face off with the other male and the female with her counterpart.<ref name =\\\"HBW\\\"/> Loudsong duets are also potentially related to the maintenance of pair bonds.<ref name=Seddon/> The functions of softsongs are more complex, and possibly related to pair-bond maintenance. In addition to these two main calls a range of other sounds are made; these include scolding in [[Animal mobbing behavior|mobbing]] of predators.<ref name =\\\"antwren coop\\\"/> The calls of antbirds are also used interspecifically. Some species of antbirds and even other birds will actively seek out ant-swarms using the calls of some species of ant-followers as clues.<ref name = \\\"calls\\\"/>\\n\\n== Distribution and habitat ==\\n\\n[[File:Thamnophilus doliatus.jpg|thumb|The [[barred antshrike]] is distributed from Mexico to Argentina. It has the hooked bill typical of the antshrikes.]]\\nThe distribution of the antbirds is entirely [[Neotropical realm|Neotropical]], with the vast majority of the species being found in the tropics. A few species reach southern Mexico and northern Argentina. Some species, such as the [[barred antshrike]], have a continental distribution that spans most of the South and [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle American]] distribution of the family; others, such as the [[ash-throated antwren]], have a tiny distribution.<ref>[[BirdLife International]] (2007) [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=4672&m=0 Species factsheet: ''Herpsilochmus parkeri''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103003505/http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=4672&m=0 |date=2009-01-03 }} Accessed on 3 April 2008</ref>\\n\\nAntbirds are mostly birds of humid lowland [[rainforest]]s.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Few species are found at higher elevations, with less than 10% of species having ranges above 2000&nbsp; m (6500&nbsp;ft) and almost none with ranges above 3000&nbsp; m (10000&nbsp;ft). The highest species diversity is found in the [[Amazon basin]], with up to 45 species being found in single locations in sites across [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. The number of species drops dramatically towards the further reaches of the family's range; there are only seven species in Mexico, for example. Areas of lower thamnophilid diversity may contain localised [[Endemism|endemics]], however. The [[Yapacana antbird]], for example, is restricted to the stunted woodlands that grow in areas of nutrient-poor white-sand [[soil]] (the so-called Amazonian [[caatinga]]) in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.<ref name = \\\"Zimmer\\\"/> Some species are predominantly associated with microhabitats within a greater ecosystem; for example, the [[bamboo antshrike]] is predominantly found in bamboo patches.<ref name=Pierpont/>\\n\\nGenetic comparison of the whole genomes of higher and lower-humidity antbirds have shown some differences in genes linked to water balance and temperature regulation. More significantly, antbirds differ in the regions of the genome that regulate gene activity, suggesting that differences for antbirds are a result less of the genes themselves than of how they are deployed.<ref name=\\\"Holmes\\\">{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Bob |title=Learning about birds from their genomes |journal=Knowable Magazine |date=10 February 2022 |doi=10.1146/knowable-021022-1 |url=https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2022/learning-about-birds-their-genomes  |doi-access=free |access-date=11 February 2022}}</ref><ref name=\\\"Bravo\\\">{{cite journal |last1=Bravo |first1=Gustavo A. |last2=Schmitt |first2=C.

Many of the family are, however, reluctant to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in [[Anting (bird activity)|anting]], a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten.<ref name = \\\"Willis\\\"/> While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather [[parasitism|parasite]]s, it has been suggested that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/>\\n\\n=== Feeding ===\\n\\n[[File:Thamnophilus caerulescens gleaning.jpg|thumb|right|A [[variable antshrike]] gleaning insects from foliage]]\\nThe main component of the diet of all antbirds is [[arthropod]]s.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> These are mostly insects, including [[Grasshopper|grasshoppers]] and [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], [[Cockroach|cockroaches]], [[Praying Mantis|praying mantises]], [[stick insects]] and the [[Larva|larvae]] of [[Butterfly|butterflies]] and [[Moth|moths]]. In addition antbirds often take [[Spider|spiders]], [[scorpions]] and [[Centipede|centipedes]]. They swallow smaller prey items quickly, whereas they often beat larger items against branches in order to remove [[Insect wing|wings]] and spines. Larger species can kill and consume [[frog]]s and [[lizard]]s as well, but generally these do not form an important part of the diet of this family.<ref name=Lopes/> Other food items may also be eaten, including [[fruit]], [[Egg|eggs]] and [[Slug|slugs]].<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/>\\n\\nThe family uses a number of techniques to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]], with most of those feeding in the [[understory]], many in the middle story and some in the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]]. A few species feed in the [[plant litter|leaf litter]]; for example, the [[wing-banded antbird]] forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up).<ref name=Tostain/> The antbirds that forage arboreally show a number of techniques and specialisations. Some species [[Gleaning (birds)|perch-glean]], perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others [[Hawking (birds)|sally]] from a perch and snatch prey on the wing.<ref name = \\\"Schulenberg\\\"/> In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species tend to be more active and pause for shorter times.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/>\\n\\n==== Mixed-species feeding flocks ====\\n\\n[[File:Black-hooded Antshrike, Thamnophilus bridgesi (Drake Bay).jpg|thumb|left|The [[black-hooded antshrike]] is a relatively sluggish species usually found singly or in pairs. Here a male feeds on a caterpillar.<!-- originally misidentified as a dot-winged antwren, hence the misleading file-name -->|upright]]\\nMany species participate in [[mixed-species foraging flock|mixed-species feeding flock]]s,<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> forming a large percentage of the participating species within their range. Some of these are core or \\\"nuclear species\\\". These nuclear species share territories with other nuclear species but exclude [[conspecificity|conspecific]]s (members of the same species) and are found in almost all flocks; these are joined by \\\"attendant species\\\". Loud and distinctive [[Bird vocalization|calls]] and conspicuous [[plumage]] are important attributes of nuclear species as they promote cohesion in the flock. The composition of these flocks varies geographically; in Amazonia species of ''[[Thamnomanes]]'' antshrike are the leading nuclear species;<ref name = \\\"Munn\\\"/> elsewhere other species, such as the [[dot-winged antwren]]s and [[checker-throated stipplethroat]]s, fill this role.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Other species of antwren and antbird join them along with [[woodcreeper]]s, [[Habia (bird)|ant-tanagers]], [[Ovenbird (family)|foliage-gleaner]]s and [[hylophilus|greenlet]]s.<ref name = \\\"Munn\\\"/> The benefits of the mixed flock are thought to be related to [[predation]], since many eyes are better for spotting predatory hawks and falcons. Comparisons between multi-species feeding flocks in different parts of the world found that instances of flocking were positively correlated with predation risk by raptors.<ref name = \\\"Thiollay\\\"/> For example, where ''Thamnomanes'' antshrikes lead the group they give loud warning calls in the presence of predators. These calls are understood and reacted to by all the other species in the flock. The advantage to the ''Thamnomanes'' antshrikes is in allowing the rest of the flock, which are typically gleaners, to act as beaters, flushing prey while foraging which the antshrikes can obtain by sallying. Similar roles are filled in other flocks by other antbird species or other bird families, for example the [[Lanio|shrike-tanager]]s.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Within the feeding flocks [[Competition (biology)|competition]] is reduced by [[Niche differentiation|microniche partitioning]]; where dot-winged antwrens, checker-throated stipplethroats and [[white-flanked antwren]]s feed in flocks together, the dot-wings feed in the densest vines, the white-flank in less dense vegetation, and the checker-throats in the same density as the latter but in dead foliage only.<ref name =\\\"antwren coop\\\"/>\\n\\n==== Ant followers ====\\n\\n[[File:Myrmeciza-immaculata-001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Immaculate antbird]]s regularly attend army ant swarms in order to feed, but they are not obligate ant-followers; they also forage away from the swarms.]]\\nSwarms of [[army ant]]s are an important resource used by some species of antbird, and the one from which the family's common name is derived. Many species of tropical [[ant]] form large raiding swarms, but the swarms are often [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] or raid underground. While birds visit these swarms when they occur, the species most commonly attended by birds is the [[Neotropical realm|Neotropical]] species ''[[Eciton burchellii]]'',<ref name = \\\"Willis\\\"/> which is both [[diurnality|diurnal]] and surface-raiding. It was once thought that attending birds were actually eating the ants, but numerous studies in various parts of ''Eciton burchellii's'' range has shown that the ants act as beaters, flushing insects, other arthropods and small vertebrates into the waiting flocks of \\\"ant followers\\\". The improvement in foraging efficiency can be dramatic; a study of [[spotted antbird]]s found that they made attempts at prey every 111.8 seconds away from ants, but at swarms they made attempts every 32.3 seconds.<ref name = \\\"Spotted\\\">{{cite journal | author = Willis E. O. | year = 1972 | title = The Behavior of Spotted Antbirds | url = http://sora.unm.edu/node/137 | journal = Ornithological Monographs | volume = 10 | page = 103 }}</ref> While many species of antbirds (and other families) may opportunistically feed at army ant swarms, 18 species of antbird are obligate ant-followers, obtaining most of their diet from swarms.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> With only three exceptions, these species never regularly forage away from ant swarms. A further four species regularly attend swarms but are as often seen away from them. Obligate ant-followers visit the nesting bivouacs of army ants in the morning to check for raiding activities; other species do not.<ref name=Swartz/> These species tend to arrive at swarms first, and their [[bird vocalization|calls]] are used by other species to locate swarming ants.<ref name = \\\"calls\\\"/>\\n\\nBecause army ants are unpredictable in their movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers to maintain a [[Territory (animal)|territory]] that always contains swarms to feed around.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Antbirds have [[evolution|evolved]] a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs of the same species may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the [[ocellated antbird]] is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain [[woodcreeper]]s, [[motmot]]s and the [[rufous-vented ground cuckoo]]). At a swarm, the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.<ref name = \\\"Willis\\\"/>\\n\\n=== Breeding ===\\n\\nAntbirds are [[monogamy in animals|monogamous]], in almost all cases forming [[pair bond]]s that last the life of the pair.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/>  Studies of the [[dusky antbird]] and the [[white-bellied antbird]] did not find \\\"infidelity\\\".<ref name=Fedy/> In the [[white-plumed antbird]], divorces between pairs are common, but, as far as known, this species is exceptional. In most species the pair defends a classic [[Territory (animal)|territory]], although the nesting territories of ant followers are slightly different (see [[Antbird#Ant followers|feeding]] above). Territories vary in size from as small as 0.5 ha for the [[Manu antbird]], to 1500&nbsp; m (5000&nbsp;ft) in diameter for the ocellated antbird. Ocellated antbirds have an unusual social system where the breeding pair forms the nucleus of a group or clan that includes their male offspring and their mates. These clans, which can number up to eight birds, work together to defend territories against rivals. Pair bonds are formed with [[courtship feeding]], where the male presents food items to the female.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> In spotted antbirds males may actually feed females sufficiently for the female to cease feeding herself, although she will resume feeding once copulation has occurred.<ref name = \\\"Spotted\\\"/> Mutual grooming also plays a role in courtship in some species.<ref name=Willis2/>\\n[[File:Phaenostictus-mcleannani-001.jpg|thumb|left|The [[ocellated antbird]] has an unusual social system of shared breeding territories. One dominant pair may share a territory with up to six other birds. ]]\\n\\nThe nesting and breeding biology of antbirds have not been well studied. Even in relatively well-known species the breeding behaviour can be poorly known; for example the nest of the [[ocellated antbird]] was first described in 2004.<ref name=Buehler/> [[bird nest|Nests]] are constructed by both parents, although the male undertakes more of the work in some species. Antbird nests are cups of vegetation such as twigs, dead leaves and plant fibre, and they follow two basic patterns: either suspended or supported.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Suspended cups, which may hang from forks in branches, or between two branches, are the more common style of nest. Supported nests rest upon branches, amongst vines, in hollows, and sometimes on mounds of vegetation on the ground. Each species nests at the level where it forages, so a midstory species would build its nest in the midstory. Closely related species nest in the same ways. For example, antvireos in the genus ''[[Dysithamnus]]'' are all suspension nesters.<ref name=Greeney/>\\n\\n[[File:Female Thamnophilus caerulescens constructing nest.jpg|thumb|A female [[variable antshrike]] constructing a nest]]\\nAlmost all antbirds lay two eggs.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> A few species of antshrike lay three eggs, and a smaller number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of tropical birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed.<ref name=Roper/> Both parents participate in [[avian incubation|incubation]], although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14\\u201316 days in most species, although some, such as the [[dusky antbird]], can take as long as 20 days. The [[altricial]] chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]], although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach [[fledge|fledging]] age, after 8\\u201315 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical for the rest of the family.\\n\\n== Ecology ==\\n\\nAntbirds are common components of the avifauna of some parts of the Neotropics and are thought to be important in some [[ecology|ecological processes]]. They are preyed upon by [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation.<ref name = \\\"Thiollay\\\"/> The [[greater round-eared bat]] preys on some antbird species, such as the [[white-bibbed antbird]] and the [[scaled antbird]]; the latter is the bat's preferred prey.<ref name=Martuscelli/> Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly [[snake]]s but also [[nocturnality|nocturnal mammals]].<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/><ref name = \\\"Loiselle\\\"/>\\n\\nIt was once suggested that the relationship between the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly ''Eciton burchellii'', was [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact [[parasitism|parasitic]].<ref name=Wrege/> This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce [[kleptoparasitism]], including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been suggested that the depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of ''E. burchellii'' swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of [[butterfly]] in the family [[Ithomiini|Ithomiinae]] which feed on their [[guano|droppings]].<ref name=Ray/> Bird droppings are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.\\n\\n== Status and conservation ==\\n\\n[[File:Pectoral Antwren.jpg|thumb|The [[pectoral antwren]] of Brazil is threatened by the loss of deciduous forest and is listed as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]].]]\\nAs of April 2008, 38 species are considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] to be [[near Threatened|near threatened]] or worse and therefore at risk of [[extinction]].<ref>[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] (2007).

Downloaded on 23 April 2008.</ref> Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor large enough to be hunted; the principal cause of the decline in antbird species is [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]].<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds. The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads. If these species become locally extinct in a fragment, this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re-establishment unlikely. Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed-species feeding flocks, leading to local extinctions.<ref name=Stouffer/> Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased [[bird nest|nest]] predation. An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on [[Barro Colorado Island]], a former hill in [[Panama]] that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the [[Panama Canal]]. Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were [[local extinction|extirpated]], in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island.<ref name=Sieving/> While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened, they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species. The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Some are also extremely poorly known; for example the [[Rio de Janeiro antwren]] is known only from a single [[Biological specimen|specimen]] collected in 1982, although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as [[critically Endangered|critically endangered]].<ref>[[BirdLife International]] (2007) [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=4658&m=0 Species factsheet: ''Myrmotherula fluminensis''.] Accessed on 26 April 2008</ref> Additionally, new species are discovered at regular intervals; the [[Caatinga antwren]] was described in 2000, the [[acre antshrike]] in 2004, the [[sincor\\u00e1 antwren]] in 2007, and the description of a relative of the [[marsh antwren|Paran\\u00e1 antwren]] discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of [[S\\u00e3o Paulo]] is being prepared.<ref name=notes/> While not yet scientifically described, conservation efforts have already been necessary, as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir.

Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the [[Deccan Plateau|Southern Deccan]] Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the [[Chennakeshava Temple, Belur|Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]].<ref name=\\\"kdravida\\\">Hardy (1995), pp. 243\\u2013245</ref><ref name=\\\"great\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 47, p. 59, p. 87</ref> These three temples were accorded UNESCO world heritage site status in 2023.<ref name=\\\"unesco\\\">{{cite web|title=Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysalas|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1670 |author=UNESCO World Heritage Convention|publisher=\\u00a9 UNESCO World Heritage Centre 1992-2023|work=UNESCO|access-date=2023-10-03}}</ref> Other examples of Hoysala craftsmanship are the temples at [[Veera Narayana Temple, Belavadi|Belavadi]], [[Amrutesvara Temple, Amruthapura|Amruthapura]], [[Lakshminarayana Temple (Hosaholalu)|Hosaholalu]], [[Nageshvara-Chennakeshava Temple complex, Mosale|Mosale]], [[Ishvara Temple (Arasikere)|Arasikere]], [[Mallikarjuna Temple, Basaralu|Basaralu]], [[Brahmeshvara Temple, Kikkeri|Kikkeri]] and [[Lakshmi Narasimha Temple, Nuggehalli|Nuggehalli]].<ref name=\\\"hardy_list\\\">Hardy (1995), p. 320, p. 321, p. 324, p. 325, p. 329, p. 332, p. 334, p. 339, p. 340, p. 346</ref><ref name=\\\"foekema_list\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 53, p. 37, p. 71, p. 81, p. 41, p. 43, p. 83</ref> Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] influence while the impact of [[Southern India]]n style is more distinct.<ref name=\\\"distinct\\\">[[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] in Kamath (2001), p. 134</ref>\\n\\nTemples built prior to Hoysala independence in the mid-12th century reflect significant Western Chalukya influences, while later temples retain some features salient to [[Western Chalukya architecture]] but have additional inventive decoration and ornamentation, features unique to Hoysala artisans. Some three hundred temples are known to survive in present-day Karnataka state and many more are mentioned in inscriptions, though only about seventy have been documented. The greatest concentration of these are in the [[Malnad]] (hill) districts, the native home of the Hoysala kings.<ref name=\\\"nativehome\\\">Hardy (1995), p. 244</ref>\\n\\nHoysala architecture is classified by the influential scholar [[Adam Hardy]] as part of the ''Karnata Dravida'' tradition, a trend within [[Dravidian architecture]] in the Deccan that is distinct from the [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] style of further south.  Other terms for the tradition are [[Vesara]], and Chalukya architecture, divided into early [[Badami Chalukya architecture]] and the [[Western Chalukya architecture]] which immediately preceded the Hoysalas. The whole tradition covers a period of about seven centuries began in the 7th century under the patronage of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] of [[Badami]], developed further under the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta]] during the 9th and 10th centuries and the [[Western Chalukya Empire|Western Chalukyas]] (or Later Chalukyas) of [[Basavakalyan]] in the 11th and 12th centuries. Its final development stage and transformation into an independent style was during the rule of the Hoysalas in the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref name=\\\"flourish\\\">Hardy (1995), pp. 6\\u20137, section ''Introduction-Dynasties and Periods''</ref> Medieval inscriptions displayed prominently at temple locations give information about donations made toward the maintenance of the temple, details of consecration and on occasion, even architectural details.<ref name=\\\"epigraph\\\">Foekema (2003), p. 18</ref>\\n\\n==Temple deities==\\n[[Image:Relief sculpture of the Hindu god Narayana with his consort Lakshmi (Lakshminarayana) in the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Vishnu with Lakshmi (''Lakshminarayana'') at [[Halebidu]]]]\\n[[Image:Relief sculpture of the Hindu god Shiva with his consort Parvati riding Nandi the bull in the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Shiva, Parvati, Nandi at [[Halebidu]]]]\\n\\nHinduism is a combination of secular and sacred beliefs, rituals, daily practices and traditions that has evolved over the course of over two thousand years and embodies complex symbolism combining the natural world with philosophy.\\n\\nHindu temples began as simple shrines housing a deity and by the time of the Hoysalas had evolved into well-articulated edifices in which worshippers sought transcendence of the daily world. Hoysala temples were not limited to any specifically organised tradition of Hinduism and encouraged pilgrims of different Hindu [[devotional movements]]. The Hoysalas usually dedicated their temples to [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]] (two of the popular Hindu gods), but they occasionally built some temples dedicated to the Jain faith as well. Worshippers of Shiva are called [[Shaivism|Shaivas]] and worshippers of Vishnu are called [[Vaishnava]]s.<ref name=\\\"worship\\\">Foekema (1996), pp. 19\\u201320, chapter-''The dedications and names of temples''</ref><ref name=\\\"iconography\\\">Hardy (1995), p. 245</ref> While King [[Vishnuvardhana]] and his descendants were Vaishnava by faith,<ref name=\\\"vaishnava\\\">Kamath (2001), p. 132</ref> records show that the Hoysalas maintained religious harmony by building as many temples dedicated to Shiva as they did to Vishnu.<ref name=\\\"equal\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 19</ref>\\n\\nMost of these temples have secular features with broad themes depicted in their sculptures. This can be seen in the famous [[Chennakeshava Temple, Belur|Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] dedicated to Vishnu and in the [[Hoysaleswara temple]] at [[Halebidu]] dedicated to Shiva. The Kesava temple at [[Somanathapura]] is different in that its ornamentation is strictly Vaishnava. Generally Vaishnava temples are dedicated to [[Keshava]] (or to Chennakeshava, meaning \\\"Beautiful Vishnu\\\") while a small number are dedicated to Lakshminarayana and Lakshminarasimha (Narayana and Narasimha both being [[Avatar]]s, or physical manifestations, of Vishnu) with [[Lakshmi]], consort of Vishnu, seated at his feet. Temples dedicated to Vishnu are always named after the deity.<ref name=\\\"ramayana1\\\"/>\\n\\nThe [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] temples have a [[Lingam|Shiva linga]], symbol of fertility and the universal symbol of Shiva, in the [[shrine]]. The names of Shiva temples can end with the suffix ''eshwara'' meaning \\\"Lord of\\\". The name \\\"Hoysaleswara\\\", for instance, means \\\"Lord of Hoysala\\\". The temple can also be named after the devotee who commissioned the construction of the temple, an example being the Bucesvara temple at Koravangala, named after the devotee Buci.<ref name=\\\"name\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 19\\u201320</ref> The most striking sculptural decorations are the horizontal rows of mouldings with detailed [[relief]], and intricately carved images of gods, goddesses and their attendants on the outer temple wall panels.<ref name=\\\"horizontal\\\">Kamath (2001), p. 134</ref>\\n\\nThe [[Doddagaddavalli]] Lakshmi Devi (\\\"Goddess of Wealth\\\") Temple is an exception as it is dedicated to neither Vishnu nor Shiva. The defeat of the Jain [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] (of present-day south Karnataka) by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of [[Vaishnava|Vaishnava Hinduism]] and [[Virashaivism]] in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in [[Jainism]].<ref name=\\\"jain\\\">Kamath (2001), pp 112, 132</ref> However, two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. The Hoysalas built [[Jain]] temples to satisfy the needs of its Jain population, a few of which have survived in [[Halebidu]] containing icons of Jain [[tirthankaras]]. They constructed stepped wells called ''Pushkarni'' or ''Kalyani'', the ornate [[temple tank|tank]] at Hulikere being an example. The tank has twelve minor shrines containing Hindu deities.<ref name=\\\"tank\\\">Foekema (1996), plate 27</ref>\\n\\nThe two main deities found in Hoysala temple sculpture are Shiva and Vishnu in their various forms and avatars (incarnations). Shiva is usually shown with four arms holding a [[trident]] and a small drum among other emblems that symbolise objects worshiped independently of the divine image with which they are associated.<ref name=\\\"Shiva\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 31, chapter:''Recognizing the most important deities''</ref> Any male icon portrayed in this way is Shiva although a female icon may sometimes be portrayed with these attributes as Shiva's consort, [[Parvati]]. Various depictions of [[Shiva]] exist: showing him naked (fully or partially), in activities such as slaying a demon ([[Andhaka]]) or dancing on the head of a slain elephant ([[Gajasura]]) and holding its skin up behind his back. He is often accompanied by his consort Parvati or shown with [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] the bull. He may be represented as [[Bhairava]], another of Shiva's many manifestations.<ref name=\\\"Shiva\\\"/>\\n\\nA male figure depicted holding certain objects such as a [[conch]] (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, [[Lakshmi]]. In all of the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] and a [[Kaumodaki]] (mace). These can be held in any of the icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name.<ref name=\\\"vishnu\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 32, chapter:''Recognizing the most important deities''</ref> Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his [[Dashavatara|''ten avataras'']], which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as [[Shesha]]), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on his lap ([[Lakshmi Narayana|Lakshminarayana]]), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on his lap ([[Narasimha|Lakshminarasimha]]), with head of a boar walking over a demon ([[Varaha]]), in the [[Krishna]] avatar (as [[Sree Venugopala|Venugopala]] or the cow herder playing the [[Venu]] (flute), dancing on the head of the snake [[Kaliya]], lifting a hill such as [[Govardhan Hill|Govardhana]]), with his feet over head of a small figure (''[[Vamana]]''), along with [[Indra]] riding an elephant, with [[Lakshmi]] seated on [[Garuda]], and the eagle (stealing the [[Parijata|parijata tree]]).<ref name=\\\"vishnu\\\"/>\\n\\n==Temple complex==\\n{{See also|Chennakeshava Temple, Belur|Hoysaleswara temple|Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura}}\\n[[Image:Hulikere Hoysala Kalyani(tank) altered.jpg|right|thumb|Hoysala stepped temple tank (''Kalyani'') at Hulikere, Karnataka]]\\n[[Image:Balligavi Kedareshwara profile retouched.JPG|thumb|right|Temple profile \\u2013 staggered square plan ''mantapa'' at [[Kedareshvara Temple, Balligavi]]]]\\n[[File:View_of_Akkana_Basadi_from_northeastern_side_at_Shravanabelagola.jpg|thumb|[[Akkana Basadi]] at [[Shravanbelgola]]]]\\n\\nThe focus of a temple is the centre or [[sanctum sanctorum]] ([[garbhagriha]]) where the image of the deity resides, so temple architecture is designed to move the devotee from outside to the garbhagriha through ambulatory passageways for [[circumambulation]] and halls or chambers (''[[mantapa]]s'') that become increasingly sacred as the deity is approached.\\nHoysala temples have distinct parts that are merged to form a unified organic whole, in contrast to the temples of [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil country]] where different parts of a temple stand independently.<ref name=\\\"cross-in-square\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 21</ref> Although superficially unique, Hoysala temples resemble each other structurally.

The temples may be built upon a platform raised by about a metre called a \\\"[[jagati (temple)|jagati]]\\\". The ''jagati'', apart from giving a raised look to the temple, serves as a ''[[pradakshina]]patha'' or \\\"[[circumambulation]] path\\\" for circumambulation around the temple, as the ''[[Garbhagriha|garbagriha]]'' ([[Sanctum sanctorum|inner sanctum]]) provides no such feature.<ref name=\\\"pradakshina\\\">Kamath (2001), p. 135</ref> Such temples will have an additional set of steps leading to an open ''[[mantapa]]'' (open hall) with [[parapet]] walls.

The ''jagati'' which is in unity with the rest of the temple<ref name=\\\"inaccurate\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 25</ref> follows a star-shaped design and the walls of the temple follow a zig-zag pattern, a Hoysala innovation.<ref name=\\\"innovate\\\">{{Cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Religion, Literature, Art and Architecture in Hoysala Empire |url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm |author=Arthikaje |publisher=1998\\u20132000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc |access-date=13 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104123316/http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka32.htm |archive-date=4 November 2006 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>\\n\\nDevotees can first complete a ritual circumambulation on the ''jagati'' starting from the main entrance by walking in a clockwise direction (towards the left) before entering the ''mantapa'', following the sculptural clockwise-sequenced [[reliefs]] on the outer temple walls depicting a sequence of epic scenes from the Hindu epics. Temples that are not built on a ''jagati'' can have steps flanked by elephant balustrades ([[parapet]]s) that lead to the ''mantapa'' from ground level. An example of a temple that does not exhibit the raised platform is the ''Bucesvara'' temple in Korvangla, [[Hassan District]].

The closed ''mantapa'' is connected to the shrines by a vestibule, a square area that also connects the shrines. Its outer walls are decorated, but as the size the vestibule is not large, this may not be a conspicuous part of the temple. The vestibule also has a short tower called the ''[[sukanasa|sukanasi]]'' or \\\"nose\\\" upon which is mounted the Hoysala emblem.

The ''vimana'' is often topped by a tower which is quite different on the outside than on the inside. Inside, the vimana is plain and square, whereas outside it is profusely decorated and can be either stellate (\\\"star-shaped\\\") or shaped as a staggered square, or feature a combination of these designs, giving it many projections and recesses that seem to multiply as the light falls on it.<ref name=\\\"cross-in-square\\\" /> Each projection and recess has a complete decorative articulation that is rhythmic and repetitive and composed of blocks and [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]], obscuring the tower profile. Depending on the number of shrines (and hence on the number of towers), the temples are classified as ''ekakuta'' (one), ''dvikuta'' (two), ''trikuta'' (three), ''chatushkuta'' (four) and ''panchakuta'' (five).

They are mixed with other small roofs of different shapes and are ornately decorated. The tower of the shrine usually has three or four tiers of rows of decorative roofs while the tower on top of the ''sukanasi'' has one less tier, making the tower look like an extension of the main tower (Foekema calls it the \\\"nose\\\").

A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants are below these towers, followed by a set of five different mouldings forming the base of the wall. In the later temples there is a second eave running about a metre below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers placed between them. The wall images of gods are below the lower eaves, followed by six different mouldings of equal size.

Going from the very base of the wall, the first horizontal layer contains a procession of elephants, above which are horsemen and then a band of foliage. The second horizontal section has depictions of the Hindu epics and ''[[Puranas|Puranic]]'' scenes executed with detail. Above this are two friezes of ''[[yali (motif)|yali]]''s or ''makara''s (imaginary beasts) and ''hamsas'' (swans). The ''vimana'' (tower) is divided into three horizontal sections and is even more ornate than the walls.<ref name=\\\"yali\\\">Art critic [[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] calls this one of the distinguishing features of Hoysala art.

Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style.<ref name=\\\"iconography\\\">Hardy (1995), p. 245</ref> Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the [[Hindu]] epics and deities or in their use of [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s such as ''yali'', ''[[kirtimukha]]'' (gargoyles), [[aedicula]] (miniature decorative towers) on [[pilaster]], ''makara'' (aquatic monster), birds (''hamsa''), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.<ref name=\\\"attention\\\">Sastri (1955), pp. 428\\u2013429; Foekema (1996), pp. 28\\u201329; Kamath (2001), p. 135</ref>\\n\\n''[[Salabhanjika]]'', a common form of Hoysala sculpture, is an old Indian tradition going back to Buddhist sculpture. ''Sala'' is the [[Sal tree|sala tree]] and {{transliteration|hi|bhanjika}} is the chaste maiden. In the Hoysala idiom, ''madanika'' figures are decorative objects put at an angle on the outer walls of the temple near the roof so that worshipers circumambulating the temple can view them.<ref name=\\\"ramayana1\\\">{{Cite web |title=Hoysala Heritage |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm|author=Settar S |publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu |work=Frontline, Volume 20 \\u2013 Issue 08, April 12\\u201325, 2003 |access-date=13 November 2006}}</ref>\\n\\nThe {{transliteration|hi|sthamba buttalikas}} are pillar images that show traces of [[Chola]] art in the Chalukyan touches. Some of the artists working for the Hoysalas may have been from Chola country, a result of the expansion of the empire into Tamil-speaking regions of Southern India. The image of ''mohini'' on one of the pillars in the ''[[mandapa|mantapa]]'' (closed hall) of the Chennakeshava temple is an example of Chola art.<ref name=\\\"ramayana1\\\"/>\\n\\nGeneral life themes are portrayed on wall panels such as the way horses were reined, the type of stirrup used, the depiction of dancers, musicians, instrumentalists, and rows of animals such as lions and elephants (where no two animals are identical). Perhaps no other temple in the country depicts the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epics more effectively than the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.<ref name=\\\"ramayana1\\\"/><ref name=\\\"ramayana\\\">The epic [[frieze]] is the most exciting feature of their sculptures (Foekema 1996, p. 29)</ref>\\n\\nErotica was a subject the Hoysala artist handled with discretion. There is no exhibitionism in this, and erotic themes were carved into recesses and niches, generally miniature in form, making them inconspicuous. These erotic representations are associated with the ''Shakta'' practice.<ref name=\\\"ramayana1\\\"/>\\n\\nApart from these sculptures, entire sequences from the [[Hindu]] epics (commonly the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction starting at the main entrance.<ref name=\\\"clockwise\\\">Foekema (1996), p. 29</ref> The right to left sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero [[Arjuna]] shooting fish, the elephant-headed god [[Ganesha]], the Sun god [[Surya]], the weather and war god [[Indra]], and [[Brahma]] with [[Sarasvati]] are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is [[Durga]], with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, in the act of killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and [[Harihara]] (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel, and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.<ref>{{Cite book\\n| first= Binda\\n| last= Thapar\\n| year= 2004\\n| title= Introduction to Indian Architecture\\n| publisher= Periplus Editions\\n| location=Singapore\\n| pages= 69\\n| isbn= 0-7946-0011-5}}</ref>\\n\\n==Research==\\n[[Image:Chikkamagalur Amruthapura kirthimukha retouched.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Kirtimukha]]'' decoration (demon faces) on tower at [[Amrutesvara Temple, Amruthapura]]]]\\n[[File:Ornate lintel and door jamb relief at entrance to inner mantapa in the Harihareshwara temple at Harihar.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Ornate lintel and door jamb relief at entrance to inner mantapa in the [[Harihareshwara Temple]] at Harihar]]\\n\\nAccording to Settar, surveys in modern times have indicated that 1000\\u20131500 structures were built by the Hoysalas, of which about a hundred temples have survived to date.<ref name=\\\"vaishnava\\\" /><ref name=\\\"records\\\">1,500 temples in 958 centres were built, according to historical records, between 1000 and 1346 CE. {{Cite web |title=Hoysala Heritage |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm|author=Settar S |publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu |work=Frontline, Volume 20 \\u2013 Issue 08, April 12\\u201325, 2003 |access-date=13 November 2006}}</ref> The Hoysala style is an offshoot of the [[Western Chalukya architecture|Western Chalukya style]], which was popular in the 10th and 11th centuries.<ref name=\\\"horizontal\\\" /> It is distinctively [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]], and according to Brown, owing to its features, Hoysala architecture qualifies as an independent style.<ref name=\\\"independent\\\">According to Percy Brown, Hoysala architecture and sculpture have been called a \\\"phenomenal effort of human concentration, skill, and religious consciousness\\\" ([[Percy Brown (scholar)|Percy Brown]] in Kamath 2001, p. 134)</ref> While the Hoysalas introduced innovative features into their architecture, they also borrowed features from earlier builders of ''Karnata'' like the [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]], [[Western Chalukyas]].

It covers an area about 2.6 [[arcminute]]s on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in [[Angular diameter|angular size]] to a [[tennis ball]] at a distance of 100&nbsp;metres.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Big Questions The Universe |first1=Stuart |last1=Clark |publisher=Hachette UK |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84916-609-6 |page=69 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkVhBQAAQBAJ}}</ref> The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's [[Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2]] over ten consecutive days between December 18 and 28, 1995.<ref name=\\\"Ferguson1998\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Hubble_image\\\" />\\n\\nThe field is so small that only a few foreground [[star]]s in the [[Milky Way]] lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are [[galaxy|galaxies]], some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image in the [[physical cosmology|study of the early universe]].\\n\\nThree years after the HDF observations were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named the [[Hubble Deep Field South]]. The similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the [[universe]] is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the [[cosmological principle]]). A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]]. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]] (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive [[astronomy|astronomical]] image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the [[Hubble eXtreme Deep Field]] (XDF) was released in 2012.\\n\\n==Conception==\\n[[File:Improvement in Hubble images after SMM1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The dramatic improvement in Hubble's imaging capabilities after corrective [[optics]] were installed encouraged attempts to obtain very deep images of distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]].]]\\n\\nOne of the key aims of the astronomers who designed the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high [[optical resolution]] to study distant galaxies to a level of detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the [[atmosphere]], Hubble avoids atmospheric [[airglow]] allowing it to take more sensitive [[Visible light|visible]] and [[ultraviolet light]] images than can be obtained with [[Astronomical seeing|seeing-limited]] ground-based telescopes (when good [[adaptive optics]] correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10&nbsp;m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from [[spherical aberration]] when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because [[Speed of light|light takes billions of years]] to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows a better understanding of how they evolve.<ref name=Ferguson1998>Ferguson et al. (1999), p.84</ref>\\n\\nAfter the spherical aberration was corrected during [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-61]] in 1993,<ref name=\\\"Trauger1994\\\">Trauger et al. (1994)</ref> the improved imaging capabilities of the telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The [[Hubble Medium Deep Survey|Medium Deep Survey]] (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.<ref>Abraham et al. (1996)</ref>\\n\\nUp to 10% of the HST's observation time is designated as Director's Discretionary (DD) Time, and is typically awarded to astronomers who wish to study unexpected transient phenomena, such as [[supernova]]e. Once Hubble's corrective optics were shown to be performing well, [[Robert Williams (astronomer)|Robert Williams]], the then-director of the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]], decided to devote a substantial fraction of his DD time during 1995 to the study of distant galaxies. A special Institute Advisory Committee recommended that the WFPC2 be used to image a \\\"typical\\\" patch of sky at a high [[galactic latitude]], using several [[optical filter]]s. A [[working group]] was set up to develop and implement the project.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\">Williams et al. (1996)</ref>\\n\\n==Target selection==\\n[[File:Hubble Deep Field location.gif|thumb|300px|The HDF is at the centre of this image of one [[degree (angle)|degree]] of sky. The Moon as seen from Earth would fill roughly one quarter of this image.]]\\n\\nThe field selected for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It had to be at a high galactic latitude because [[interstellar dust|dust]] and obscuring matter in the plane of the [[Milky Way]]'s disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes (see [[Zone of Avoidance]]). The target field had to avoid known bright sources of [[visible light]] (such as foreground stars), and [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]], and [[X-ray]] emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background [[infrared cirrus]], the diffuse, wispy infrared emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of [[hydrogen]] gas ([[H I region]]s).<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nThese criteria restricted the field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble's continuous viewing zones: the areas of sky that are not [[occultation|occulted]] by the Earth or the [[moon]] during Hubble's orbit.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" /> The working group decided to concentrate on the northern continuous viewing zone, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the [[Keck telescopes]], the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] telescopes, and the [[Very Large Array]] (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.<ref name=\\\"north_cvz\\\">{{cite web |author=Ferguson, H. |date=1996 |url=http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/project/field.html |title=The Hubble Deep Field{{snd}}field selection |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |access-date=December 26, 2008}}</ref>\\n\\nTwenty fields satisfying these criteria were identified, from which three optimal candidate fields were selected, all within the constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. [[Radio]] snapshot observations with the VLA ruled out one of these fields because it contained a bright radio source, and the final decision between the other two was made on the basis of the availability of guide stars near the field: Hubble observations normally require a pair of nearby stars on which the telescope's Fine Guidance Sensors can lock during an exposure, but given the importance of the HDF observations, the working group required a second set of back-up guide stars. The field that was eventually selected is located at a [[right ascension]] of {{RA|12|36|49.4}} and a [[declination]] of {{DEC|+62|12|58}};<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" /><ref name=\\\"north_cvz\\\" /> it is about 2.6 [[arcminute]]s in width,<ref name=\\\"Ferguson1998\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Ferguson2000a\\\">Ferguson (2000a)</ref> or 1/12 the width of the Moon. The area is about 1/24,000,000 of the total area of the sky.\\n\\n==Observations==\\n[[File:Hubble Deep Field observing geometry.svg|thumb|left|The HDF was in Hubble's northern Continuous Viewing Zone, as shown by this diagram.]]\\n[[File:Hubble Ultra Deep Field diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram illustrating comparative sampling distance of the HDF and the 2004 [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]]]]\\n\\nOnce a field was selected, an observing strategy was developed. An important decision was to determine which [[filter (optics)|filter]]s the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with 48 filters, including [[narrowband]] filters isolating particular [[emission line]]s of [[astrophysical]] interest, and [[broadband]] filters useful for the study of the colors of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the [[throughput]] of each filter\\u2014the total proportion of light that it allows through\\u2014and the spectral coverage available. Filters with [[bandpass]]es overlapping as little as possible were desirable.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nIn the end, four broadband filters were chosen, centred at [[wavelength]]s of 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (near-[[ultraviolet]]), 450&nbsp;nm (blue light), 606&nbsp;nm (red light) and 814&nbsp;nm (near-[[infrared]]). Because the [[quantum efficiency]] of Hubble's detectors at 300&nbsp;nm wavelength is quite low, the noise in observations at this wavelength is primarily due to [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nBetween December 18 and 28, 1995\\u2014during which time Hubble orbited the Earth about 150 times\\u2014342 images of the target area in the chosen filters were taken. The total exposure times at each wavelength were 42.7 hours (300&nbsp;nm), 33.5 hours (450&nbsp;nm), 30.3 hours (606&nbsp;nm) and 34.3 hours (814&nbsp;nm), divided into 342 individual exposures to prevent significant damage to individual images by [[cosmic ray]]s, which cause bright streaks to appear when they strike CCD detectors. A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\n==Data processing==\\n[[File:Galaxy in each of the four wavelengths comprising the HDF.jpg|thumb|300px|A section of the HDF about 14 [[arcseconds]] across in each of the four [[wavelength]]s used to construct the final version: 300 [[Nanometre|nm]] (top left), 450 nm (top right), 606 nm (bottom left) and 814 nm (bottom right)]]\\nThe production of a final combined image at each [[wavelength]] was a complex process. Bright [[pixel]]s caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by [[cosmic ray]]s in one exposure but not the other. Trails of [[space debris]] and [[artificial satellite]]s were present in the original images, and were carefully removed.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nScattered light from the Earth was evident in about a quarter of the data frames, creating a visible \\\"X\\\" pattern on the images. This was removed by taking an image affected by scattered light, aligning it with an unaffected image, and subtracting the unaffected image from the affected one. The resulting image was smoothed, and could then be subtracted from the bright frame. This procedure removed almost all of the scattered light from the affected images.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nOnce the 342 individual images were cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, they had to be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called '[[Drizzle (image processing)|drizzling]]', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 [[arcsecond]]s across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.<ref name=\\\"Williams1996\\\" />\\n\\nThe data processing yielded four [[monochrome]] images (at 300&nbsp;nm, 450&nbsp;nm, 606&nbsp;nm and 814&nbsp;nm), one at each wavelength.<ref name=Ferguson1/> One image was designated as red (814&nbsp;nm), the second as green (606&nbsp;nm) and the third as blue (450&nbsp;nm), and the three images were combined to give a color image.<ref name=Hubble_image>{{cite web |publisher=NASA |date=1996 |title=Hubble's Deepest View of the Universe Unveils Bewildering Galaxies across Billions of Years |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1996/01/image/a/ |access-date=January 12, 2009}}</ref> Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colors in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colors of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colors corresponding to what the [[human eye]] would actually perceive.<ref name=Ferguson1>Ferguson et al.

While [[quasar]]s with high redshifts were known, very few galaxies with redshifts greater than one were known before the HDF images were produced.<ref name=\\\"key_findings\\\" /> The HDF, however, contained many galaxies with redshifts as high as six, corresponding to distances of about 12 billion [[light-year]]s.

There are [[List of antbirds|more than 230 species]], known variously as antshrikes, antwrens, antvireos, fire-eyes, bare-eyes and bushbirds. They are related to the antthrushes and antpittas (family [[Formicariidae]]), the [[tapaculo]]s, the [[gnateater]]s and the [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]]. Despite some species' common names, this family is not closely related to the [[wren]]s, [[vireo]]s or [[shrike]]s.\\n\\nAntbirds are generally small birds with rounded wings and strong legs. They have mostly sombre grey, white, brown and [[rufous]] [[plumage]], which is [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] in pattern and colouring. Some species communicate warnings to rivals by exposing white feather patches on their backs or shoulders. Most have heavy [[beak|bills]], which in many species are hooked at the tip.\\n\\nMost species live in forests, although a few are found in other habitats. Insects and other [[arthropod]]s form the most important part of their diet, although small vertebrates are occasionally taken. Most species feed in the [[understory]] and midstory of the forest, although a few feed in the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] and a few on the ground. Many join [[mixed-species foraging flock|mixed-species feeding flock]]s, and a few species are core members. To various degrees, around eighteen species specialise in [[ant follower|following]] swarms of [[army ant]]s to eat the small [[invertebrate]]s flushed by the ants, and many others may feed in this way opportunistically.\\n\\nAntbirds are [[monogamy in animals|monogamous]], mate for life, and defend [[Territory (animal)|territories]]. They usually lay two eggs in a nest that is either suspended from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of [[avian incubation|incubation]] and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After [[fledge|fledging]], each parent cares exclusively for one chick.\\n\\nThirty-eight species are threatened with extinction as a result of human activities. Antbirds are not targeted by either hunters or the pet trade. The principal threat is [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]], which causes [[habitat fragmentation]] and increased nest predation in habitat fragments.\\n\\n== Systematics ==\\n{{see also|List of antbird genera|List of antbird species}}\\nThe antbird family Thamnophilidae used to be considered  a subfamily, Thamnophilinae, within a larger family [[Formicariidae]] that included [[formicariidae|antthrush]]es and [[formicariidae|antpitta]]s. Formerly, that larger family was known as the \\\"antbird family\\\" and the Thamnophilinae were \\\"typical antbirds\\\". In this article, \\\"antbird\\\" and \\\"antbird family\\\" refer to the family Thamnophilidae.\\n\\nThamnophilidae was removed from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to recognition of differences in the structure of the breastbone ([[sternum]]) and [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]], and [[Sibley\\u2013Ahlquist taxonomy of birds|Sibley and Ahlquist's]] examination of [[DNA\\u2013DNA hybridization]].<ref>[[Charles Sibley|Sibley, C.

Yale University Press, New Haven, Conn. {{ISBN|0-300-04085-7}}.</ref><ref name = \\\"Rice\\\"/> The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or [[Tyranni|tracheophone suboscines]]), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to their relatives the antthrushes and antpittas, [[tapaculo]]s, [[gnateater]]s, and also the [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]].<ref name = \\\"Irestedt2002\\\"/> The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.<!-- needs a ref, also meaning is unclear; try writing it out as nested parentheses, then expand into words -->\\n\\nThe antbird family contains over 230 species, variously called antwrens, antvireos, antbirds and antshrikes. The names refer to the relative sizes of the birds (increasing in the order given, though with exceptions) rather than any particular resemblance to the true [[wren]]s, [[vireo]]s or [[shrike]]s. In addition, members of the genus ''Phlegopsis'' are known as [[phlegopsis|bare-eye]]s, ''Pyriglena'' as [[pyriglena|fire-eye]]s and ''Neoctantes'' and ''Clytoctantes'' as [[Clytoctantes|bushbird]]s. Although the systematics of the Thamnophilidae is based on studies from the mid-19th century, when fewer than half the present species were known, comparison of the [[myoglobin]] [[intron]] 2, [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase|GAPDH]] intron 11 and the [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]]s has largely confirmed it.<ref name = \\\"Irestedt 2004\\\"/> There are two major [[clade]]s \\u2013 most antshrikes and other larger, strong-billed species as well as ''[[Herpsilochmus]]'', versus the classical antwrens and other more slender, longer-billed species \\u2013 and the [[monophyly]] of most genera was confirmed.\\n\\nThe Thamnophilidae contains several large or very large [[genus|genera]] and numerous small or [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] ones. Several, which are difficult to assign, seem to form a third, hitherto unrecognised clade independently derived from ancestral antbirds.<ref name = \\\"Irestedt 2004\\\"/> The results also confirmed suspicions of previous researchers that some species, most notably in ''[[Myrmotherula]]'' and ''[[Myrmeciza]]'', need to be assigned to other genera. Still, due to the difficulties of sampling from such a large number of often poorly known species, the assignment of some genera is still awaiting confirmation.\\n\\n== Morphology ==\\n\\n[[File:Gymnopithys-leucaspis-001 edit2.jpg|thumb|left|The legs and feet of [[ant follower|ant-following]] antbirds are stable and adapted to gripping vertical stems and branches.

Members of this family have short rounded wings that provide good manoeuvrability when [[bird flight|flying]] in dense undergrowth. The legs are large and strong, particularly in species that are obligate [[ant-follower]]s. These species are well adapted to gripping vertical stems and [[tree|sapling]]s, which are more common than horizontal branches in the undergrowth, and thus the ability to grip them is an advantage for birds following swarms of army ants. The claws of these antbirds are longer than those of species that do not follow ants, and the soles of some species have projections that are tough and gripping when the foot is clenched. [[Tarsus (skeleton)|Tarsus]] length in antbirds is related to foraging strategy. Longer tarsi typically occur in genera such as the ''[[Thamnophilus]]'' antshrikes that forage by perch-[[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] (sitting and leaning forward to snatch insects from the branch), whereas shorter tarsi typically occur in those that catch prey on the wing, such as the ''[[Thamnomanes]]'' antshrikes.<ref name = \\\"Schulenberg\\\"/>\\n\\nMost antbirds have proportionately large, heavy [[beak|bills]].<ref name = \\\"Schulenberg\\\"/> Several genera of antshrike have a strongly hooked tip to the bill, and all antbirds have a notch or 'tooth' at the tip of the bill which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two [[genus|genera]] of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.<ref name=Lanyon/>\\n\\nThe [[plumage]] of antbirds is soft and not brightly coloured, although it is occasionally striking.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> The colour palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or patterned with barring or spots. [[Sexual dimorphism]] \\u2013 differences in plumage colour and pattern between males and females \\u2013 is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and brown colours. For example, the male [[dot-winged antwren]] is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts.<ref name = \\\"Greenberg\\\"/> In some genera, such as ''Myrmotherula'', species are better distinguished by female plumage than by male.<ref>Rice, N.

This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. dot-winged antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in [[bluish-slate antshrike]]s and [[white-flanked antwren]]s the white patch is on the shoulder.<ref name = \\\"Munn\\\"/>\\n\\n=== Voice ===\\n[[File:Drymophila ochropyga.jpeg|thumb|[[Ochre-rumped antbird]] calling]]\\n[[File:Song of Thamnophilus doliatus.ogg|right|thumb|Song of the [[barred antshrike]]]]\\nThe [[Bird vocalization|songs and calls]] of antbirds are generally composed of repeated simple uncomplicated notes. The family is one of the suboscines (suborder [[Tyranni]]) which have simpler [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinxes]] (\\\"voiceboxes\\\") than other songbirds. Nevertheless, their songs are distinctive and species-specific, allowing field identification by ear.<ref name =\\\"HBW\\\"/> Antbirds rely on their calls for communication, as is typical of birds in dark forests. Most species have at least two types of call, the ''loudsong'' and the ''softsong''. The functions of many calls have been deduced from their context; for example some loudsongs have a [[territory (animal)|territorial purpose]] and are given when birds meet at the edges of their territories, or during the morning rounds of the territory. Pairs in neighbouring territories judge the proximity of rivals by the degradation of the song caused by interference by the environment.<ref name=Morton/> In bouts of territorial defence the male will face off with the other male and the female with her counterpart.<ref name =\\\"HBW\\\"/> Loudsong duets are also potentially related to the maintenance of pair bonds.<ref name=Seddon/> The functions of softsongs are more complex, and possibly related to pair-bond maintenance. In addition to these two main calls a range of other sounds are made; these include scolding in [[Animal mobbing behavior|mobbing]] of predators.<ref name =\\\"antwren coop\\\"/> The calls of antbirds are also used interspecifically. Some species of antbirds and even other birds will actively seek out ant-swarms using the calls of some species of ant-followers as clues.<ref name = \\\"calls\\\"/>\\n\\n== Distribution and habitat ==\\n\\n[[File:Thamnophilus doliatus.jpg|thumb|The [[barred antshrike]] is distributed from Mexico to Argentina. It has the hooked bill typical of the antshrikes.]]\\nThe distribution of the antbirds is entirely [[Neotropical realm|Neotropical]], with the vast majority of the species being found in the tropics. A few species reach southern Mexico and northern Argentina. Some species, such as the [[barred antshrike]], have a continental distribution that spans most of the South and [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle American]] distribution of the family; others, such as the [[ash-throated antwren]], have a tiny distribution.<ref>[[BirdLife International]] (2007) [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=4672&m=0 Species factsheet: ''Herpsilochmus parkeri''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103003505/http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=4672&m=0 |date=2009-01-03 }} Accessed on 3 April 2008</ref>\\n\\nAntbirds are mostly birds of humid lowland [[rainforest]]s.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Few species are found at higher elevations, with less than 10% of species having ranges above 2000&nbsp; m (6500&nbsp;ft) and almost none with ranges above 3000&nbsp; m (10000&nbsp;ft). The highest species diversity is found in the [[Amazon basin]], with up to 45 species being found in single locations in sites across [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. The number of species drops dramatically towards the further reaches of the family's range; there are only seven species in Mexico, for example. Areas of lower thamnophilid diversity may contain localised [[Endemism|endemics]], however. The [[Yapacana antbird]], for example, is restricted to the stunted woodlands that grow in areas of nutrient-poor white-sand [[soil]] (the so-called Amazonian [[caatinga]]) in Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.<ref name = \\\"Zimmer\\\"/> Some species are predominantly associated with microhabitats within a greater ecosystem; for example, the [[bamboo antshrike]] is predominantly found in bamboo patches.<ref name=Pierpont/>\\n\\nGenetic comparison of the whole genomes of higher and lower-humidity antbirds have shown some differences in genes linked to water balance and temperature regulation. More significantly, antbirds differ in the regions of the genome that regulate gene activity, suggesting that differences for antbirds are a result less of the genes themselves than of how they are deployed.<ref name=\\\"Holmes\\\">{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Bob |title=Learning about birds from their genomes |journal=Knowable Magazine |date=10 February 2022 |doi=10.1146/knowable-021022-1 |url=https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2022/learning-about-birds-their-genomes  |doi-access=free |access-date=11 February 2022}}</ref><ref name=\\\"Bravo\\\">{{cite journal |last1=Bravo |first1=Gustavo A. |last2=Schmitt |first2=C.

Many of the family are, however, reluctant to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in [[Anting (bird activity)|anting]], a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten.<ref name = \\\"Willis\\\"/> While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather [[parasitism|parasite]]s, it has been suggested that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/>\\n\\n=== Feeding ===\\n\\n[[File:Thamnophilus caerulescens gleaning.jpg|thumb|right|A [[variable antshrike]] gleaning insects from foliage]]\\nThe main component of the diet of all antbirds is [[arthropod]]s.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> These are mostly insects, including [[Grasshopper|grasshoppers]] and [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], [[Cockroach|cockroaches]], [[Praying Mantis|praying mantises]], [[stick insects]] and the [[Larva|larvae]] of [[Butterfly|butterflies]] and [[Moth|moths]]. In addition antbirds often take [[Spider|spiders]], [[scorpions]] and [[Centipede|centipedes]]. They swallow smaller prey items quickly, whereas they often beat larger items against branches in order to remove [[Insect wing|wings]] and spines. Larger species can kill and consume [[frog]]s and [[lizard]]s as well, but generally these do not form an important part of the diet of this family.<ref name=Lopes/> Other food items may also be eaten, including [[fruit]], [[Egg|eggs]] and [[Slug|slugs]].<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/>\\n\\nThe family uses a number of techniques to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]], with most of those feeding in the [[understory]], many in the middle story and some in the [[canopy (forest)|canopy]]. A few species feed in the [[plant litter|leaf litter]]; for example, the [[wing-banded antbird]] forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up).<ref name=Tostain/> The antbirds that forage arboreally show a number of techniques and specialisations. Some species [[Gleaning (birds)|perch-glean]], perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others [[Hawking (birds)|sally]] from a perch and snatch prey on the wing.<ref name = \\\"Schulenberg\\\"/> In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species tend to be more active and pause for shorter times.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/>\\n\\n==== Mixed-species feeding flocks ====\\n\\n[[File:Black-hooded Antshrike, Thamnophilus bridgesi (Drake Bay).jpg|thumb|left|The [[black-hooded antshrike]] is a relatively sluggish species usually found singly or in pairs. Here a male feeds on a caterpillar.<!-- originally misidentified as a dot-winged antwren, hence the misleading file-name -->|upright]]\\nMany species participate in [[mixed-species foraging flock|mixed-species feeding flock]]s,<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> forming a large percentage of the participating species within their range. Some of these are core or \\\"nuclear species\\\". These nuclear species share territories with other nuclear species but exclude [[conspecificity|conspecific]]s (members of the same species) and are found in almost all flocks; these are joined by \\\"attendant species\\\". Loud and distinctive [[Bird vocalization|calls]] and conspicuous [[plumage]] are important attributes of nuclear species as they promote cohesion in the flock. The composition of these flocks varies geographically; in Amazonia species of ''[[Thamnomanes]]'' antshrike are the leading nuclear species;<ref name = \\\"Munn\\\"/> elsewhere other species, such as the [[dot-winged antwren]]s and [[checker-throated stipplethroat]]s, fill this role.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Other species of antwren and antbird join them along with [[woodcreeper]]s, [[Habia (bird)|ant-tanagers]], [[Ovenbird (family)|foliage-gleaner]]s and [[hylophilus|greenlet]]s.<ref name = \\\"Munn\\\"/> The benefits of the mixed flock are thought to be related to [[predation]], since many eyes are better for spotting predatory hawks and falcons. Comparisons between multi-species feeding flocks in different parts of the world found that instances of flocking were positively correlated with predation risk by raptors.<ref name = \\\"Thiollay\\\"/> For example, where ''Thamnomanes'' antshrikes lead the group they give loud warning calls in the presence of predators. These calls are understood and reacted to by all the other species in the flock. The advantage to the ''Thamnomanes'' antshrikes is in allowing the rest of the flock, which are typically gleaners, to act as beaters, flushing prey while foraging which the antshrikes can obtain by sallying. Similar roles are filled in other flocks by other antbird species or other bird families, for example the [[Lanio|shrike-tanager]]s.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Within the feeding flocks [[Competition (biology)|competition]] is reduced by [[Niche differentiation|microniche partitioning]]; where dot-winged antwrens, checker-throated stipplethroats and [[white-flanked antwren]]s feed in flocks together, the dot-wings feed in the densest vines, the white-flank in less dense vegetation, and the checker-throats in the same density as the latter but in dead foliage only.<ref name =\\\"antwren coop\\\"/>\\n\\n==== Ant followers ====\\n\\n[[File:Myrmeciza-immaculata-001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Immaculate antbird]]s regularly attend army ant swarms in order to feed, but they are not obligate ant-followers; they also forage away from the swarms.]]\\nSwarms of [[army ant]]s are an important resource used by some species of antbird, and the one from which the family's common name is derived. Many species of tropical [[ant]] form large raiding swarms, but the swarms are often [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] or raid underground. While birds visit these swarms when they occur, the species most commonly attended by birds is the [[Neotropical realm|Neotropical]] species ''[[Eciton burchellii]]'',<ref name = \\\"Willis\\\"/> which is both [[diurnality|diurnal]] and surface-raiding. It was once thought that attending birds were actually eating the ants, but numerous studies in various parts of ''Eciton burchellii's'' range has shown that the ants act as beaters, flushing insects, other arthropods and small vertebrates into the waiting flocks of \\\"ant followers\\\". The improvement in foraging efficiency can be dramatic; a study of [[spotted antbird]]s found that they made attempts at prey every 111.8 seconds away from ants, but at swarms they made attempts every 32.3 seconds.<ref name = \\\"Spotted\\\">{{cite journal | author = Willis E. O. | year = 1972 | title = The Behavior of Spotted Antbirds | url = http://sora.unm.edu/node/137 | journal = Ornithological Monographs | volume = 10 | page = 103 }}</ref> While many species of antbirds (and other families) may opportunistically feed at army ant swarms, 18 species of antbird are obligate ant-followers, obtaining most of their diet from swarms.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> With only three exceptions, these species never regularly forage away from ant swarms. A further four species regularly attend swarms but are as often seen away from them. Obligate ant-followers visit the nesting bivouacs of army ants in the morning to check for raiding activities; other species do not.<ref name=Swartz/> These species tend to arrive at swarms first, and their [[bird vocalization|calls]] are used by other species to locate swarming ants.<ref name = \\\"calls\\\"/>\\n\\nBecause army ants are unpredictable in their movements, it is impractical for obligate ant-followers to maintain a [[Territory (animal)|territory]] that always contains swarms to feed around.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Antbirds have [[evolution|evolved]] a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds. They generally (details vary among species) maintain breeding territories but travel outside those territories in order to feed at swarms. Several pairs of the same species may attend a swarm, with the dominant pair at the swarm being the pair which holds the territory that the swarm is in. In addition to competition within species, competition among species exists, and larger species are dominant. In its range, the [[ocellated antbird]] is the largest of the obligate ant-following antbirds and is dominant over other members of the family, although it is subordinate to various species from other families (including certain [[woodcreeper]]s, [[motmot]]s and the [[rufous-vented ground cuckoo]]). At a swarm, the dominant species occupies positions above the central front of the swarm, which yields the largest amount of prey. Smaller, less dominant species locate themselves further away from the centre, or higher above the location of the dominant species, where prey is less plentiful.<ref name = \\\"Willis\\\"/>\\n\\n=== Breeding ===\\n\\nAntbirds are [[monogamy in animals|monogamous]], in almost all cases forming [[pair bond]]s that last the life of the pair.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/>  Studies of the [[dusky antbird]] and the [[white-bellied antbird]] did not find \\\"infidelity\\\".<ref name=Fedy/> In the [[white-plumed antbird]], divorces between pairs are common, but, as far as known, this species is exceptional. In most species the pair defends a classic [[Territory (animal)|territory]], although the nesting territories of ant followers are slightly different (see [[Antbird#Ant followers|feeding]] above). Territories vary in size from as small as 0.5 ha for the [[Manu antbird]], to 1500&nbsp; m (5000&nbsp;ft) in diameter for the ocellated antbird. Ocellated antbirds have an unusual social system where the breeding pair forms the nucleus of a group or clan that includes their male offspring and their mates. These clans, which can number up to eight birds, work together to defend territories against rivals. Pair bonds are formed with [[courtship feeding]], where the male presents food items to the female.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> In spotted antbirds males may actually feed females sufficiently for the female to cease feeding herself, although she will resume feeding once copulation has occurred.<ref name = \\\"Spotted\\\"/> Mutual grooming also plays a role in courtship in some species.<ref name=Willis2/>\\n[[File:Phaenostictus-mcleannani-001.jpg|thumb|left|The [[ocellated antbird]] has an unusual social system of shared breeding territories. One dominant pair may share a territory with up to six other birds. ]]\\n\\nThe nesting and breeding biology of antbirds have not been well studied. Even in relatively well-known species the breeding behaviour can be poorly known; for example the nest of the [[ocellated antbird]] was first described in 2004.<ref name=Buehler/> [[bird nest|Nests]] are constructed by both parents, although the male undertakes more of the work in some species. Antbird nests are cups of vegetation such as twigs, dead leaves and plant fibre, and they follow two basic patterns: either suspended or supported.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Suspended cups, which may hang from forks in branches, or between two branches, are the more common style of nest. Supported nests rest upon branches, amongst vines, in hollows, and sometimes on mounds of vegetation on the ground. Each species nests at the level where it forages, so a midstory species would build its nest in the midstory. Closely related species nest in the same ways. For example, antvireos in the genus ''[[Dysithamnus]]'' are all suspension nesters.<ref name=Greeney/>\\n\\n[[File:Female Thamnophilus caerulescens constructing nest.jpg|thumb|A female [[variable antshrike]] constructing a nest]]\\nAlmost all antbirds lay two eggs.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> A few species of antshrike lay three eggs, and a smaller number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of tropical birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed.<ref name=Roper/> Both parents participate in [[avian incubation|incubation]], although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14\\u201316 days in most species, although some, such as the [[dusky antbird]], can take as long as 20 days. The [[altricial]] chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to [[thermoregulation|thermoregulate]], although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach [[fledge|fledging]] age, after 8\\u201315 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical for the rest of the family.\\n\\n== Ecology ==\\n\\nAntbirds are common components of the avifauna of some parts of the Neotropics and are thought to be important in some [[ecology|ecological processes]]. They are preyed upon by [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], and their tendency to join flocks is thought to provide protection against such predation.<ref name = \\\"Thiollay\\\"/> The [[greater round-eared bat]] preys on some antbird species, such as the [[white-bibbed antbird]] and the [[scaled antbird]]; the latter is the bat's preferred prey.<ref name=Martuscelli/> Nests, including incubating adults, chicks and eggs, are vulnerable to predators, particularly [[snake]]s but also [[nocturnality|nocturnal mammals]].<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Nesting success is low for many species, particularly in areas of fragmented habitat.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/><ref name = \\\"Loiselle\\\"/>\\n\\nIt was once suggested that the relationship between the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly ''Eciton burchellii'', was [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact [[parasitism|parasitic]].<ref name=Wrege/> This has resulted in a number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce [[kleptoparasitism]], including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been suggested that the depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of ''E. burchellii'' swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of [[butterfly]] in the family [[Ithomiini|Ithomiinae]] which feed on their [[guano|droppings]].<ref name=Ray/> Bird droppings are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.\\n\\n== Status and conservation ==\\n\\n[[File:Pectoral Antwren.jpg|thumb|The [[pectoral antwren]] of Brazil is threatened by the loss of deciduous forest and is listed as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]].]]\\nAs of April 2008, 38 species are considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] to be [[near Threatened|near threatened]] or worse and therefore at risk of [[extinction]].<ref>[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] (2007).

Downloaded on 23 April 2008.</ref> Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor large enough to be hunted; the principal cause of the decline in antbird species is [[habitat destruction|habitat loss]].<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds. The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads. If these species become locally extinct in a fragment, this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re-establishment unlikely. Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed-species feeding flocks, leading to local extinctions.<ref name=Stouffer/> Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased [[bird nest|nest]] predation. An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on [[Barro Colorado Island]], a former hill in [[Panama]] that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the [[Panama Canal]]. Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were [[local extinction|extirpated]], in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island.<ref name=Sieving/> While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened, they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species. The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges.<ref name = \\\"HBW\\\"/> Some are also extremely poorly known; for example the [[Rio de Janeiro antwren]] is known only from a single [[Biological specimen|specimen]] collected in 1982, although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as [[critically Endangered|critically endangered]].<ref>[[BirdLife International]] (2007) [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=4658&m=0 Species factsheet: ''Myrmotherula fluminensis''.] Accessed on 26 April 2008</ref> Additionally, new species are discovered at regular intervals; the [[Caatinga antwren]] was described in 2000, the [[acre antshrike]] in 2004, the [[sincor\\u00e1 antwren]] in 2007, and the description of a relative of the [[marsh antwren|Paran\\u00e1 antwren]] discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of [[S\\u00e3o Paulo]] is being prepared.<ref name=notes/> While not yet scientifically described, conservation efforts have already been necessary, as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir.

Over the course of his career, he played in various groups and performed a range of music including [[blues]], [[blues rock]], [[hard rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[jazz fusion]].\\n\\nInfluenced by [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] and [[Eric Clapton]], Moore began his career in the late 1960s when he joined [[Skid Row (Irish band)|Skid Row]], with whom he released two albums. After Moore left the group he joined [[Thin Lizzy]], featuring his former Skid Row bandmate and frequent collaborator [[Phil Lynott]]. Moore began his solo career in the 1970s and achieved major success with 1979's \\\"[[Parisienne Walkways]]\\\", which is considered his [[signature song]]. During the 1980s, Moore transitioned into playing hard rock and heavy metal with varying degrees of international success. In 1990, he returned to his roots with ''[[Still Got the Blues]]'', which became the most successful album of his career. Moore continued to release new music throughout his later career, collaborating with other artists from time to time. Moore died on 6 February 2011 from a heart attack while on holiday in Spain.\\n\\nMoore was often described as a [[virtuoso]] and has been cited as an influence by many other guitar players. He was voted as one of the greatest guitarists of all time on respective lists by ''[[Total Guitar]]'' and ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Louder]]''. Irish singer-songwriter [[Bob Geldof]] said that \\\"without question, [Moore] was one of the great Irish bluesmen\\\".<ref name=\\\"BBC obituary\\\">{{cite news |title=Irish rock guitarist Gary Moore: an obituary |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12382274 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=7 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208020612/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12382274 |archive-date=8 February 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=9 September 2020}}</ref> For most of his career, Moore was heavily associated with Peter Green's famed [[Greeny (guitar)|1959 Gibson Les Paul]] guitar.

The first installment in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|franchise of the same name]], it was the [[Firsts in animation|first entirely computer-animated feature film]], as well as the first feature film from Pixar. It was directed by [[John Lasseter]] (in his feature [[directorial debut]]) and produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], from a screenplay written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] and a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. The film features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (American actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\\n\\nTaking place in a world where [[toy]]s come to life when humans are not present, the plot of ''Toy Story'' focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and a modern space cadet action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz when he becomes their owner Andy's favorite toy.\\n\\nFollowing the success of ''[[Tin Toy]]'', a [[short film]] that was released in 1988, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film that was told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \\\"edgier\\\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \\\"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\\\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced ''Toy Story'' under minor financial constraints.\\n\\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22 of that year. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\\\"Numbers\\\" /> eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the [[1995 in film|second highest-grossing film of 1995]]. The film received critical acclaim and holds a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|{{RT data|score}} approval rating]] on film aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. It was praised for the technical innovation of the 3D animation, script, Newman's score, appeal to all age groups, and voice performances (particularly Hanks and Allen); it is frequently lauded as [[List of films considered the best#Animation (shorts and features)|one of the best animated films ever made]] and, due to its status as the first computer-animated film, one of the most important films in the medium's history and film at large.<ref name=\\\"best-animation\\\" /> The film received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations\\u2014[[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] (the first animated film to be nominated for the award), [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \\\"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\\\", and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\\u2014in addition to being honored with a non-competitive [[Special Achievement Academy Award]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=King |first1=Susan |title=How 'Toy Story' changed the face of animation, taking off 'like an explosion' |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toy-story-anniversary-20150930-story.html |access-date=September 30, 2015 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070711/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-toy-story-anniversary-20150930-story.html|archive-date=October 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2005, ''Toy Story'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \\\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\\", one of nine films designated in its first year of eligibility. The success of ''Toy Story'' launched a multimedia franchise. It spawned three sequels beginning with ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (1999), a spin-off film ''[[Lightyear (film)|Lightyear]]'' (2022), numerous [[Toy Story (franchise)#Toy Story Treats (1996)|short films]], and a planned fourth sequel.

Learning that Andy's birthday party has been unexpectedly moved to an earlier date, several toys \\u2014 including [[List of Toy Story characters#Mr. Potato Head|Mr. Potato Head]], [[Slinky Dog (Toy Story)|Slinky Dog]], [[Rex (Toy Story)|Rex the tyrannosaur]], [[Hamm (Toy Story)|Hamm the piggy bank]], and [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]] the [[porcelain doll]] \\u2014 become concerned that Andy might receive something that will replace them. To calm them, [[Sheriff Woody]], Andy's favorite toy and their ''[[de facto]]'' leader, sends [[Sarge (Toy Story)|Sarge]] and his [[Army men|green army men]] to spy on Andy's birthday party with a [[baby monitor]]. Andy receives a [[Buzz Lightyear]] [[action figure]], who believes he is an actual Space Ranger and does not know he is a toy. Buzz impresses the others with his high-tech features and becomes Andy's new favorite toy, provoking Woody's jealousy.\\n\\nTwo days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet. To ensure Andy brings him along and not Buzz, Woody tries knocking Buzz behind the desk with the [[radio-controlled car]] [[List of Toy Story characters#RC|RC]]. However, Buzz is accidentally knocked out of the bedroom window instead, and most of the other toys believe Woody has deliberately killed Buzz. Andy takes Woody with him, but Buzz furiously confronts him in the car. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind; after a further quarrel, they hitch a ride to the restaurant on a Pizza Planet delivery truck. \\n\\nAt Pizza Planet, Buzz mistakes a [[claw crane]] full of [[List of Toy Story characters#The Aliens|Little Green Men]] for a rocket, and climbs in, pursued by Woody. [[List of Toy Story characters#Phillips family|Sid Phillips]], Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor, takes the two from the crane to his house, where they encounter his [[English Bull Terrier|Bull Terrier]] [[List of Toy Story characters#Phillips family|Scud]] and his \\\"mutant\\\" toys, made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.\\n\\nBuzz, after watching a television commercial promoting him, realizes he is a toy after all. He attempts to fly but falls, breaks his arm, and suffers a mental breakdown. After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid tapes Buzz to a [[firework|rocket]], planning to blow him up the following day. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is to make Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to blow him up, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to \\\"break the rules\\\" and frighten Sid into never harming toys again.\\n\\nNow freed, Buzz and Woody pursue the Davis' [[moving truck]], but Scud attacks Woody. Buzz stays behind to fight off the dog; Woody climbs into the truck, and pushes RC out to rescue Buzz. Still thinking Woody has killed Buzz, the toys also toss him out of the truck.

In 1988, Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', which was told from the perspective of a toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys.

They later learned that while Katzenberg was pushing the idea of working with Pixar, Schneider did not want to bring in a non-Disney animation studio. Katzenberg arranged to meet directly with the Pixar contingent, this time including Lasseter and Jobs. The Pixar team proposed a [[List of United States Christmas television specials|Christmas television special]], ''A Tin Toy Christmas'', as a first step, but Katzenberg countered that as long as they were gearing up to transition from 30-second commercials to a half-hour special, they might as well go all the way and make a feature-length film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\\n\\nKatzenberg also made it clear that he was only working with Pixar to get access to Lasseter's talents,{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} and that the Pixar team would be signing up to work with a self-described \\\"tyrant\\\" and micro-manager.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} However, he invited them to talk with Disney's animators and get their opinions on working under him and Lasseter was impressed with what he heard.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} The two companies began negotiations, although they disagreed on key points including whether Disney would get the rights to Pixar's animation technology{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} or whether Pixar would retain partial ownership of the films, characters, and home video and sequel rights.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} As Pixar was nearing bankruptcy and desperate for funds,{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} they settled on a deal that would allow Disney to have complete ownership and control of the films and characters, including the rights to make sequels without Pixar's involvement, while Pixar would get approximately 12.5% of ticket sales.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\\\"BizWeekBOX\\\" /> These early negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}\\n\\nAn agreement to produce a feature film based on ''Tin Toy'' with a working title of ''Toy Story'' was finalized, and production began soon thereafter.<ref name=\\\"PixMagicMan\\\">{{cite news |last=Schlender |first=Brent |url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm |title=Pixar's magic man |date=May 17, 2006 |publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]] |access-date=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715081233/http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Writing ===\\nOriginally, ''Toy Story'' was going to feature \\\"Tinny\\\", the wind-up one-man band toy from the ''Tin Toy'' short film, along with \\\"the dummy\\\", a [[ventriloquist's dummy]].

Instead, he encouraged them to write it as a [[buddy film]], giving the two main characters contrasting personalities, and having them only become friends after being forced to work together.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter delivered a revised treatment in September 1991 that more closely resembles the final version of the film: Tinny replaces the ventriloquist dummy as a child's favorite toy, their bickering causes them to be left behind at a gas station, they almost catch up to the family at a pizza restaurant, they have to escape a kid that mutilates toys, and the movie ends with a chase scene as the two toys try to catch up to the family's moving van.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}}\\n\\nThe script went through many changes before the final version of it. Lasseter decided Tinny was \\\"too antiquated\\\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure in the likes of ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' and was then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually [[Buzz Lightyear]] (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as the aforementioned ''G.I.

Convergent evolution creates '''analogous structures''' that have similar form or function but were not present in the [[last common ancestor]] of those groups. The [[cladistic]] term for the same phenomenon is [[Cladogram#Homoplasies|homoplasy]]. The [[recurrent evolution]] of flight is a classic example, as flying [[pterygota|insect]]s, [[bird]]s, [[pterosaurs]], and [[bat]]s have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight. Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are ''analogous'', whereas ''[[homology (biology)|homologous]]'' structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions.  Bird, bat, and pterosaur [[wings]] are analogous structures, but their forelimbs are homologous, sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions.\\n\\nThe opposite of convergence is [[divergent evolution]], where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution is similar to [[parallel evolution]], which occurs when two independent species evolve in the same direction and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, [[flying frog|gliding frog]]s have evolved in parallel from multiple types of [[tree frog]].\\n\\nMany instances of convergent evolution are known in [[plant]]s, including the repeated development of [[C4 photosynthesis|C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis]], [[seed dispersal]] by fleshy [[fruit]]s adapted to be eaten by animals, and [[carnivorous plant|carnivory]].\\n\\n==Overview==\\n[[File:Analogous & Homologous Structures.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Homology (biology)|Homology]] and analogy in mammals and insects: on the horizontal axis, the structures are homologous in morphology, but different in function due to differences in habitat.

From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene ([[genetic drift|selectively neutral]]) has a steadily decreasing [[probability]] of retaining potential functionality over time.

Hunter spent the next few years in foster homes before returning to live with his mother. These experiences drove him to seek refuge in books, and he wrote a 50-page fairy tale before he was 11. His mother married again, to Norman Hunter, whose last name Robert took. The elder Hunter was a publisher, who gave Robert lessons in writing.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\"/> Hunter attended high school in Palo Alto, learning to play several instruments as a teenager. His family moved to Connecticut, where he attended the [[University of Connecticut]]. He played trumpet in a band called the Crescents.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> Hunter left the university after a year, and returned to Palo Alto.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> He enlisted in the [[National Guard]], and spent six months training, before doing a six-month tour of duty.{{sfn|McNally|2007|p=28}}\\n\\nUpon his return to Palo Alto, in 1961 he was introduced to [[Jerry Garcia]] by Garcia's then-girlfriend, who had previously been in a relationship with Hunter.

Although their musical style was developing, the album produced several popular songs, including \\\"China Cat Sunflower\\\", which became an enduring part of the Grateful Dead's repertoire.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> A few months before ''Aoxomoxoa'' was released, Hunter and his then-partner Christie Bourne began sharing a house with Garcia, his wife, and his step-daughter. Living in close proximity gave additional impetus to their collaborative songwriting.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> Hunter's relationship with the band grew until he was officially a non-performing band member. The band's reputation also grew; in 1970, a group led by [[Miles Davis]] opened a concert for the band.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" />\\n\\nAfter ''Aoxomoxoa'', the band shifted from an experimentalist approach toward [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and [[country music]], featured in their albums ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]'' and ''[[Workingman's Dead]]''. This period produced some of their most successful songs, including \\\"Cumberland Blues\\\", \\\"Box of Rain\\\", and \\\"Sugar Magnolia\\\".<ref name=\\\"The Guardian\\\" /> Many of these pieces were written by Hunter and would go on to become enduring folk songs; according to McNally, pieces such as \\\"[[Ripple (song)|Ripple]]\\\" grew to be \\\"part of the American canon.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> The band's composition methods were varied. Hunter sometimes wrote lyrics the others composed music around; sometimes, he wrote lyrics to music; and sometimes, the group worked together to create music and lyrics simultaneously.<ref name=\\\"The Guardian\\\" /><ref name=\\\"LATimes\\\" /> Their musical improvisation was often inspired by psychedelic experiences under the influence of LSD,{{sfn|McNally|2007|p=103}} and by other hallucinatory experiences: Hunter wrote \\\"[[Dire Wolf (song)|Dire Wolf]]\\\" inspired by a dream after watching a film adaptation of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.{{sfn|McNally|2007|p=316}}\\n\\nHunter's participation in the Grateful Dead was dominated by his collaboration with Garcia, based on, according to McNally, \\\"friendship, common experience, Hunter's extraordinary capacity for empathy, and his sterling ability to translate that into lyrics.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> He also worked with other band members; in particular, on ''Workingman's Dead'' he worked with McKernan on \\\"Easy Wind\\\", and on ''American Beauty'', with Lesh on \\\"Box of Rain\\\", and Weir on \\\"Sugar Magnolia\\\". However, he eventually decided he could only work with Garcia, and the duo wrote numerous songs together over the next 25 years.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> Their relationship was often challenged by Garcia's difficulties with drug addiction; in 2015, Hunter said he was unhappy with the extent of [[cocaine]] use among band members in the mid-1970s.<ref name=Browne/> Hunter was described as a \\\"proudly irascible\\\" presence in the band, who would often veto attempts to use the band's songs for commercial purposes.<ref name=\\\"Rolling Stone Obit\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Browne\\\"/> After Garcia's death from a heart attack at a heroin rehabilitation clinic in 1995, the Grateful Dead disbanded.{{sfn|McNally|2007|pp=615\\u2013618}}\\n\\n== Collaborations ==\\nFollowing the dissolution of the Grateful Dead, Hunter successfully continued his writing career, working on new songs with [[Jim Lauderdale]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Cesar Rosas]], and [[Bruce Hornsby]], among others.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' compared his lyrical aesthetic to that of Bob Dylan and [[Randy Newman]], and wrote he was one of the few lyricists who \\\"delved into the unique characteristics of the American psyche\\\". Hunter was the only writer to collaborate extensively with Dylan.

McNally writes that while Garcia was one of the \\\"outstanding guitar players and songwriters of his generation\\\", his lyrical abilities were minor. Many of the Grateful Dead's early lyrics were \\\"superficial\\\" and simple.

He was a philanthropic ruler and a successful soldier-emperor who led the [[Roman Empire]] to its [[Roman expansion|greatest territorial extent]] by the time of his death. He was given the title of {{lang|la|Optimus}} ('the best') by the [[Roman Senate]].\\n\\nTrajan was born in the ''[[municipium]]'' of [[Italica]] in the present-day [[Andalusia]]n province of [[province of Seville|Seville]] in southern Spain, an [[Italic peoples|Italic settlement]] in [[Hispania Baetica]]; his [[gens Ulpia]] came from the town of [[Todi|Tuder]] in the [[Regio VI Umbria|Umbria]] region of central Italy. His namesake father, [[Marcus Ulpius Traianus (father of Trajan)|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]], was a general and distinguished senator. Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of [[Domitian]]; in AD 89, serving as a ''[[legatus legionis]]'' in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], he supported the emperor against a revolt on the [[Rhine]] led by [[Antonius Saturninus]].

Ginsburg transferred to [[Columbia Law School]], where she graduated joint first in her class. During the early 1960s she worked with the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learned Swedish, and co-authored a book with Swedish jurist [[Anders Bruzelius]]; her work in Sweden profoundly influenced her thinking on gender equality. She then became a professor at [[Rutgers Law School]] and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.\\n\\nGinsburg spent much of her legal career as an advocate for [[gender equality]] and [[women's rights]], winning many arguments before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer attorney for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsel in the 1970s. In 1980, President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed her to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993. Between O'Connor's retirement in 2006 and the appointment of [[Sonia Sotomayor]] in 2009, she was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, such as with ''[[Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.]]''{{spaces}}(2007).\\n\\nDespite two bouts with cancer and public pleas from liberal law scholars, she decided not to retire in [[113th United States Congress|2013 or 2014]] when President [[Barack Obama]] and a Democratic-controlled Senate could appoint and confirm her successor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Biskupic |first1=Joan |title=U.S. Justice Ginsburg hits back at liberals who want her to retire |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-ginsburg/u-s-justice-ginsburg-hits-back-at-liberals-who-want-her-to-retire-idUSKBN0G12V020140801 |work=Reuters |date=August 2014 |access-date=July 11, 2021 |archive-date=July 11, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210711182109/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-ginsburg/u-s-justice-ginsburg-hits-back-at-liberals-who-want-her-to-retire-idUSKBN0G12V020140801 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\\\"rbg-retirement-obama\\\">{{cite news |last1=Dominu |first1=Susan |last2=Savage |first2=Charlie |title=The Quiet 2013 Lunch That Could Have Altered Supreme Court History |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/us/politics/rbg-retirement-obama.html |access-date=January 27, 2021 |work=The New York Times |date=September 25, 2020 |archive-date=January 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210127083330/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/us/politics/rbg-retirement-obama.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Prokop |first1=Andrew |title=Some liberals want Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire.

Ginsburg noted that the driver's employer did have a relationship with the tribe, but she reasoned that the tribe could not regulate their activities because the victim had no relationship to the tribe. Ginsburg concluded that although \\\"those who drive carelessly on a public highway running through a reservation endanger all in the vicinity, and surely jeopardize the safety of tribal members\\\", having a nonmember go before an \\\"unfamiliar court\\\" was \\\"not crucial to the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the Three Affiliated Tribes\\\" (internal quotations and brackets omitted).

Hunter spent the next few years in foster homes before returning to live with his mother. These experiences drove him to seek refuge in books, and he wrote a 50-page fairy tale before he was 11. His mother married again, to Norman Hunter, whose last name Robert took. The elder Hunter was a publisher, who gave Robert lessons in writing.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\"/> Hunter attended high school in Palo Alto, learning to play several instruments as a teenager. His family moved to Connecticut, where he attended the [[University of Connecticut]]. He played trumpet in a band called the Crescents.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> Hunter left the university after a year, and returned to Palo Alto.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> He enlisted in the [[National Guard]], and spent six months training, before doing a six-month tour of duty.{{sfn|McNally|2007|p=28}}\\n\\nUpon his return to Palo Alto, in 1961 he was introduced to [[Jerry Garcia]] by Garcia's then-girlfriend, who had previously been in a relationship with Hunter.

Although their musical style was developing, the album produced several popular songs, including \\\"China Cat Sunflower\\\", which became an enduring part of the Grateful Dead's repertoire.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> A few months before ''Aoxomoxoa'' was released, Hunter and his then-partner Christie Bourne began sharing a house with Garcia, his wife, and his step-daughter. Living in close proximity gave additional impetus to their collaborative songwriting.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> Hunter's relationship with the band grew until he was officially a non-performing band member. The band's reputation also grew; in 1970, a group led by [[Miles Davis]] opened a concert for the band.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" />\\n\\nAfter ''Aoxomoxoa'', the band shifted from an experimentalist approach toward [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and [[country music]], featured in their albums ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]'' and ''[[Workingman's Dead]]''. This period produced some of their most successful songs, including \\\"Cumberland Blues\\\", \\\"Box of Rain\\\", and \\\"Sugar Magnolia\\\".<ref name=\\\"The Guardian\\\" /> Many of these pieces were written by Hunter and would go on to become enduring folk songs; according to McNally, pieces such as \\\"[[Ripple (song)|Ripple]]\\\" grew to be \\\"part of the American canon.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> The band's composition methods were varied. Hunter sometimes wrote lyrics the others composed music around; sometimes, he wrote lyrics to music; and sometimes, the group worked together to create music and lyrics simultaneously.<ref name=\\\"The Guardian\\\" /><ref name=\\\"LATimes\\\" /> Their musical improvisation was often inspired by psychedelic experiences under the influence of LSD,{{sfn|McNally|2007|p=103}} and by other hallucinatory experiences: Hunter wrote \\\"[[Dire Wolf (song)|Dire Wolf]]\\\" inspired by a dream after watching a film adaptation of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.{{sfn|McNally|2007|p=316}}\\n\\nHunter's participation in the Grateful Dead was dominated by his collaboration with Garcia, based on, according to McNally, \\\"friendship, common experience, Hunter's extraordinary capacity for empathy, and his sterling ability to translate that into lyrics.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> He also worked with other band members; in particular, on ''Workingman's Dead'' he worked with McKernan on \\\"Easy Wind\\\", and on ''American Beauty'', with Lesh on \\\"Box of Rain\\\", and Weir on \\\"Sugar Magnolia\\\". However, he eventually decided he could only work with Garcia, and the duo wrote numerous songs together over the next 25 years.<ref name=\\\"Daily Beast\\\" /> Their relationship was often challenged by Garcia's difficulties with drug addiction; in 2015, Hunter said he was unhappy with the extent of [[cocaine]] use among band members in the mid-1970s.<ref name=Browne/> Hunter was described as a \\\"proudly irascible\\\" presence in the band, who would often veto attempts to use the band's songs for commercial purposes.<ref name=\\\"Rolling Stone Obit\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Browne\\\"/> After Garcia's death from a heart attack at a heroin rehabilitation clinic in 1995, the Grateful Dead disbanded.{{sfn|McNally|2007|pp=615\\u2013618}}\\n\\n== Collaborations ==\\nFollowing the dissolution of the Grateful Dead, Hunter successfully continued his writing career, working on new songs with [[Jim Lauderdale]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Cesar Rosas]], and [[Bruce Hornsby]], among others.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' compared his lyrical aesthetic to that of Bob Dylan and [[Randy Newman]], and wrote he was one of the few lyricists who \\\"delved into the unique characteristics of the American psyche\\\". Hunter was the only writer to collaborate extensively with Dylan.

McNally writes that while Garcia was one of the \\\"outstanding guitar players and songwriters of his generation\\\", his lyrical abilities were minor. Many of the Grateful Dead's early lyrics were \\\"superficial\\\" and simple.

He was a philanthropic ruler and a successful soldier-emperor who led the [[Roman Empire]] to its [[Roman expansion|greatest territorial extent]] by the time of his death. He was given the title of {{lang|la|Optimus}} ('the best') by the [[Roman Senate]].\\n\\nTrajan was born in the ''[[municipium]]'' of [[Italica]] in the present-day [[Andalusia]]n province of [[province of Seville|Seville]] in southern Spain, an [[Italic peoples|Italic settlement]] in [[Hispania Baetica]]; his [[gens Ulpia]] came from the town of [[Todi|Tuder]] in the [[Regio VI Umbria|Umbria]] region of central Italy. His namesake father, [[Marcus Ulpius Traianus (father of Trajan)|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]], was a general and distinguished senator. Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of [[Domitian]]; in AD 89, serving as a ''[[legatus legionis]]'' in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], he supported the emperor against a revolt on the [[Rhine]] led by [[Antonius Saturninus]].

Ginsburg transferred to [[Columbia Law School]], where she graduated joint first in her class. During the early 1960s she worked with the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learned Swedish, and co-authored a book with Swedish jurist [[Anders Bruzelius]]; her work in Sweden profoundly influenced her thinking on gender equality. She then became a professor at [[Rutgers Law School]] and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.\\n\\nGinsburg spent much of her legal career as an advocate for [[gender equality]] and [[women's rights]], winning many arguments before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer attorney for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsel in the 1970s. In 1980, President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed her to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993. Between O'Connor's retirement in 2006 and the appointment of [[Sonia Sotomayor]] in 2009, she was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, such as with ''[[Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.]]''{{spaces}}(2007).\\n\\nDespite two bouts with cancer and public pleas from liberal law scholars, she decided not to retire in [[113th United States Congress|2013 or 2014]] when President [[Barack Obama]] and a Democratic-controlled Senate could appoint and confirm her successor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Biskupic |first1=Joan |title=U.S. Justice Ginsburg hits back at liberals who want her to retire |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-ginsburg/u-s-justice-ginsburg-hits-back-at-liberals-who-want-her-to-retire-idUSKBN0G12V020140801 |work=Reuters |date=August 2014 |access-date=July 11, 2021 |archive-date=July 11, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210711182109/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-ginsburg/u-s-justice-ginsburg-hits-back-at-liberals-who-want-her-to-retire-idUSKBN0G12V020140801 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\\\"rbg-retirement-obama\\\">{{cite news |last1=Dominu |first1=Susan |last2=Savage |first2=Charlie |title=The Quiet 2013 Lunch That Could Have Altered Supreme Court History |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/us/politics/rbg-retirement-obama.html |access-date=January 27, 2021 |work=The New York Times |date=September 25, 2020 |archive-date=January 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210127083330/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/us/politics/rbg-retirement-obama.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Prokop |first1=Andrew |title=Some liberals want Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire.

Ginsburg noted that the driver's employer did have a relationship with the tribe, but she reasoned that the tribe could not regulate their activities because the victim had no relationship to the tribe. Ginsburg concluded that although \\\"those who drive carelessly on a public highway running through a reservation endanger all in the vicinity, and surely jeopardize the safety of tribal members\\\", having a nonmember go before an \\\"unfamiliar court\\\" was \\\"not crucial to the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the Three Affiliated Tribes\\\" (internal quotations and brackets omitted).

In the 1840s, percussionists began to experiment with foot pedals as a way to enable them to play more than one instrument, but these devices would not be mass-produced for another 75 years.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-06-08 |title=Classic: The Birth Of Bass Drum Pedals |url=https://drummagazine.com/classic-the-birth-of-bass-drum-pedals/ |access-date=2022-11-03 |website=DRUM! Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> By the 1860s, percussionists started combining multiple drums into a kit. The bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, and other percussion instruments were all struck with hand-held drumsticks. Drummers in [[musical theatre|musical theater]] appeared in stage shows, where the budget for [[pit orchestra]]s was often limited due to an insufficient amount of money able to purchase a full percussionist team. This contributed to the creation of the drum kit by developing techniques and devices that would enable one person to replace multiple percussionists.\\n\\n[[Double-drumming]] was developed to enable one person to play both bass and snare drums with sticks, while the cymbals could be played by tapping the foot on a \\\"low-boy\\\". With this approach, the bass drum was usually played on beats one and three (in {{music|time|4|4}} time). While the music was first designed to accompany marching soldiers, this simple and straightforward drumming approach led to the birth of [[ragtime]] music, when the simple marching beats became more [[Syncopation|syncopated]]. This resulted in a greater [[Swing music|swing]] and dance feel. The drum kit was initially referred to as a \\\"trap set\\\", and from the late 1800s to the 1930s, drummers were referred to as \\\"trap drummers\\\". By the 1870s, drummers were using an overhang pedal.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Britt |first=Dan |title=A History of the American Drum Kit |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2018 |isbn= |pages=74\\u201375}}</ref> Most drummers in the 1870s preferred to do double-drumming without any pedal to play multiple drums, rather than use an overhang pedal. Companies patented their pedal systems, such as that of drummer Edward \\\"Dee Dee\\\" Chandler of New Orleans in 1904 or 1905.<ref>Porter/Hull man/Hazel (1993). ''[[iarchive:jazzfromitsorigi00port/page/18/mode/2up|Jazz \\u2013 From its Origins to the Present]]'', p. 18. {{ISBN|0-13-512195-7}}.</ref> This led to the bass drum being played by percussionists standing and using their feet, hence the term \\\"kick drum\\\".  \\n\\n[[William F. Ludwig Sr.]] and his brother Theobald founded [[Ludwig Drums|Ludwig & Ludwig Co.]] in 1909 and patented the first commercially successful [[bass drum pedal]] system.<ref name=\\\"DRUMHISTORY\\\"/> \\n\\nIn 1912, drummers replaced sticks with wire brushes and, later, metal fly swatters as the louder sounds made by using drumsticks could overpower other instruments.\\n\\n===20th century===\\nBy [[World War I]], drum kits were often marching-band-style bass drums with many percussion items around them and suspended from them. Drum kits became a central part of jazz, especially [[Dixieland]]. The modern drum kit was developed in the [[vaudeville]] era, during the 1920s, in New Orleans.<ref name=\\\"Cohan\\\">{{cite book |last1=Cohan |first1=Jon |title=Star sets: Drum Kits of the Great Drummers |date=1995 |publisher=Hal Leonard |location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin |isbn=0-7935-3489-5}}</ref>\\n\\nDrummers such as [[Baby Dodds]], [[Zutty Singleton]], and [[Ray Bauduc]] took the idea of marching rhythms and combined the bass drum, snare drum, and \\\"traps\\\"{{snd}}a term used to refer to the percussion instruments associated with immigrant groups, which included miniature cymbals, [[Tom drum|tom toms]], [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]], and [[Woodblock (instrument)|woodblocks]]. They started incorporating these elements into ragtime, which had been popular for a few decades, creating an approach that evolved into a jazz drumming style.\\n\\nBudget constraints and space considerations in musical theater pit orchestras led bandleaders to pressure percussionists to cover more percussion parts. Metal consoles were developed to hold Chinese tom-toms, with swing-out stands for snare drums and cymbals. On top of the console was a \\\"contraption\\\" tray (shortened to \\\"trap\\\"), used to hold items like whistles, klaxons, and cowbells. These kits were dubbed \\\"trap kits\\\". Hi-hat stands became available around 1926.<ref name=\\\"DRUMHISTORY\\\">{{cite book |title=The Drum Book: The History of the Rock Drum Kit |first=Geoff |last=Nichols |year=1997 |location=London |publisher=Balafon Books |pages=8\\u201312 |isbn=0879304766 }}</ref>\\n\\nIn 1918, [[Baby Dodds]], playing on [[Mississippi River]] riverboats with [[Louis Armstrong]], modified the military marching setup, experimenting with playing the drum rims instead of woodblocks, hitting cymbals with sticks (which was not yet common), and adding a side cymbal above the bass drum, which became known as the [[ride cymbal]]. William Ludwig developed the \\\"sock\\\" or early low-mounted [[hi-hat]] after observing Dodds' drumming. Dodds asked Ludwig to raise the newly produced low-hat cymbal nine inches to make them easier to play, thus creating the modern hi-hat cymbal.<ref>Information on Dodds is found in his own contemporary journals/biography \\\"The Baby Dodds Story\\\" \\u2013 Louisiana State University Press, 1992, and from a contemporary witness \\u2013 drummer George Wettling, who confirms that Dodds was the first drummer to keep the now-famous broken-triplet beat that became the standard pulse/roll of what we call ride cymbal playing.</ref> Dodds was one of the first drummers to play the broken-triplet beat that became the standard rhythm of modern ride cymbal playing. He also popularized the use of [[China cymbal|Chinese cymbals]].<ref>pp. 8\\u20139, Jon Cohan's- \\\"Star Sets\\\"- Wording, see page nine; paragraphs 1\\u20134. Further: see the Percussive Arts Society, 'Hall of Fame' Article, by Rick Mattingly].</ref> Recording technology was crude, which meant loud sounds could distort the recording. To get around this, Dodds used woodblocks and drum rims as quieter alternatives to cymbals and drum skins.<ref name=\\\"New Grove\\\">{{cite book |last1=Sheridan |first1=Chris |editor1-last=Kernfeld |editor1-first=Barry |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz |date=2002 |publisher=Grove's Dictionaries |location=New York |isbn=1-56159-284-6 |page=373 |volume=3 |edition=2}}</ref>\\n\\nIn the 1920s, freelance drummers were hired to play at shows, concerts, theaters, and clubs to support dancers and musicians of various genres. Orchestras were hired to accompany silent films, and the drummer was responsible for providing the sound effects. Sheet music from the 1920s shows that the drummer's sets were starting to evolve in size to support the various acts. However, by 1930, films with audio were more popular, and many were accompanied by pre-recorded soundtracks. This technological breakthrough put thousands of drummers who served as sound effects specialists out of work,<ref>{{Cite web |last=LeBlanc |first=Jason |date=2018-01-30 |title=A Quick History of the Drum Machine, from the 1980s to Today |url=https://www.funktasy.com/music-gear-tech/drum-machine-history/ |access-date=2022-11-03 |website=Funktasy |language=en-US}}</ref> with some drummers obtaining work as [[Foley artist]]s for those motion-picture sound tracks.\\n\\n==Playing==\\n\\n===Grooves===\\n{{main|Drum beat}}\\n\\nKit drumming, whether accompanying voices and other instruments or performing a drum solo, consists of two elements:\\n* A [[groove (music)|groove]] that sets the basic time-feel and provides a rhythmic framework for the song (examples include a backbeat or [[Rosanna shuffle|shuffle]]). Grooves can set the mood of the song.\\n* [[Drum fill]]s and other [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] and [[variation (music)|variations]] that provide variety and add interest to the drum sound. Fills could include a [[Sting (percussion)|sting]] at the end of a musical section or act as a drum showpiece.\\n\\n===Fills===\\n{{main|Drum fill}}\\n\\nA [[Fill (music)|fill]] is a departure from the repetitive rhythm pattern in a song. A drum fill can be used to \\\"fill in\\\" the space between the end of one verse and the beginning of another verse or chorus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.onlinedrummer.com/drum-lessons/what-is-a-drum-fill-really/|title=What is a Drum Fill, Really? |website= OnlineDrummer.com|last=Brown|first=Nate|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Fills vary from a simple few strokes on a tom or snare to a distinctive rhythm played on the hi-hat, to sequences several bars long that are short virtuosic drum solos. As well as adding interest and variation to the music, fills serve an important function in indicating significant changes of sections in songs as well as linking them together. A ''vocal cue'' is a short drum fill that introduces a singer's entrance into the piece. A fill ending with a cymbal crash on beat one is often used to lead into a chorus or verse.\\n\\n===Drum solos===\\n{{main|Drum solo}}\\n\\nA drum solo is an instrumental section that highlights the drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drummagazine.com/steve-smith-on-the-art-history-of-drum-soloing/|title=Steve Smith on the Art & History of Drum Soloing|date=2011-02-09|website=DRUM!

Some drummers may use [[double bass drumming|two or more bass drums]] or a double pedal on a single bass drum, which enables a drummer to play a double-bass-drum style with only one drum. This saves space in recording/performance areas and reduces time and effort during set-up, taking down, and transportation. Double bass drumming is a technique used in certain genres, including [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[progressive rock]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mattingly |first=Rick |url=https://archive.org/details/allaboutdrumsfun0000matt/page/4/mode/2up |title=All About Drums: A Fun and Simple Guide to Playing Drums |publisher=[[Hal Leonard]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-423408-18-5 |edition= |location=Milwaukee, WI |pages=5 |oclc=1150827839}}</ref>\\n\\n====Snare drum====\\n[[File:2006-07-06 snare 14.jpg|thumb|Snare drum on a modern light-duty snare drum stand]]\\n{{main|Snare drum}}\\n\\nThe snare drum provides the [[backbeat]]. When applied in this fashion, it supplies strong regular accents played by the non-dominant hand and is the backbone for many [[drum fill|fills]]. Its distinctive sound can be attributed to the bed of stiff metal wires held under tension against the bottom head (known as the snare head). When the top head (known as the batter head) is struck with a drumstick, the snare wires vibrate, creating a snappy, [[staccato]] buzzing sound, along with the sound of the stick striking the batter head.\\n\\n====Toms====\\n[[File:Keith Moon 4 - The Who - 1975.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]] with a mixture of [[concert tom]]s and conventional toms, 1975]]\\n{{main|Tom-tom drum}}\\n\\nTom-tom drums, or toms for short, are drums without snares and played with sticks (or whatever tools the music style requires) and are the most numerous drums in most kits. They provide the bulk of most drum fills and solos.\\n\\nThey include:\\n* Traditional double-headed [[Tom drum|rack toms]] of varying diameters and depths\\n* [[Floor tom]]s (generally the widest and largest toms, which also makes them the lowest-pitched toms)\\n* Single-headed [[concert tom]]s\\n* [[Rototoms]]\\n\\nThe smallest and largest drums without snares ([[octobans]] and [[gong drum]]s, respectively) are sometimes considered toms. The naming of [[#Common configurations|common configurations]] (four-piece, five-piece, etc.) is largely a reflection of the number of toms, as conventionally only the drums are counted, and these configurations all contain one snare and one or more bass drums, (though not regularly any standardized use of two bass/kick drums) the balance usually being made up by toms.\\n\\n====Other drums====\\n[[File:Anders Johansson 2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Anders Johansson (drummer)|Anders Johansson]] with an array of octobans]]\\n\\n[[Octobans]] are smaller toms designed for use in a drum kit, extending the tom range upwards in pitch, primarily by their great depth and small diameter. They are also called rocket toms and tube toms.\\n\\n[[Timbales]] are tuned much higher than a tom of the same diameter, typically have drum shells made of metal, and are normally played with very light, thin, non-tapered sticks. Timbales are more common in Latin music. They have thin heads and a very different tone than a tom but are used by some drummers/percussionists to extend the tom range upwards. Alternatively, they can be fitted with tom heads and tuned as shallow concert toms.\\n\\nAttack timbales and [[mini timbales]] are reduced-diameter timbales designed for drum kit usage, the smaller diameter allowing for thicker heads providing the same pitch and head tension. They are recognizable in genres of the 2010s and more traditional forms of Latin, reggae, and numerous other styles.\\n\\nGong drums are a rare extension of a drum kit. This single-headed mountable drum appears similar to a bass drum (around 20\\u201324 inches in diameter) but is played with sticks rather than a foot-operated pedal and therefore has the same purpose as a floor tom.\\n\\nMost [[hand drum]]s cannot be played with drumsticks without risking damage to the head and bearing edge, which is not protected by a metal drum rim. For use in a drum kit, they may be fitted with a metal drum head and played with sticks with care, or played by hand.\\n\\n===Cymbals===\\n[[File:Portnoy 2327834448 d06703c5cd o.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Mike Portnoy]], drummer of [[Dream Theater]], with a multitude of cymbals. Rio de Janeiro, 7 March 2008]]\\n\\nIn most drum kits and drum/percussion kits, cymbals are as prominent as the drums themselves. The oldest [[Idiophone|idiophones]] in music are cymbals, a version of which were used throughout the ancient Near East very early in the Bronze Age period. Cymbals are mostly associated with Turkey and Turkish craftsmanship, where [[Zildjian]] has made them since 1623.<ref>Remnant, M. (1989). Musical instruments. (pp. 159\\u2013174). London: B.T. Batsford Ltd</ref>\\n\\nWhile most drummers purchase cymbals individually, beginner [[cymbal pack]]s were brought to market to provide entry-level cymbals for the novice drummer. The kits normally contain four cymbals: one ride, one crash, and a pair of hi-hats. Some contain only three cymbals, using a [[crash/ride]] instead of the separate ride and crash. The sizes closely follow those given in [[#Common configurations|Common configurations]] below. Most drummers extend the normal configuration by adding another crash, a splash, and/or a china/effects cymbal.\\n\\n====Ride cymbal====\\n{{main|Ride cymbal}}\\n\\nThe ride cymbal is most often used for keeping a constant rhythm pattern, every beat or more often, as the music requires. Development of this ride technique is generally credited to jazz drummer [[Baby Dodds]].<ref name=\\\"pas\\\">{{cite web | url=http://www.pas.org/experience/halloffame/DoddsWarren.aspx | title=Warren 'Baby' Dodds | publisher=The Percussive Arts Society | access-date=21 November 2011 | quote=Dodds' way of playing press rolls ultimately evolved into the standard jazz ride-cymbal pattern. Whereas many drummers would play very short press rolls on the backbeats, Dodds would start his rolls on the backbeats but extend each one to the following beat, providing a smoother time flow. | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927104938/http://www.pas.org/experience/halloffame/DoddsWarren.aspx | archive-date=27 September 2011 }}</ref>\\n\\nMost drummers have a single main ride, located near their dominant hand{{snd}}within easy playing reach, as it is used regularly{{snd}}often a 20\\\"\\u201322\\\" in diameter, but diameters of 16\\\"\\u201326\\\" are not uncommon. It is usually a medium-heavy- to heavy-weight cymbal whose sound that cuts through other instrumental sounds. Some drummers use a [[swish cymbal]], [[sizzle cymbal]], or other exotic or lighter metal rides, as the main or only ride in their kit, particularly for jazz, gospel, or ballad/folk sounds. In the 1960s, [[Ringo Starr]] of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] used a sizzle cymbal as a second ride, particularly during guitar solos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/ringos-cymbal-sound.111931/|title=Ringo\\u00b4s cymbal sound|website=Steve Hoffman Music Forums|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\\n\\n====Hi-hats====\\n{{main|Hi-hat (instrument)}}\\n[[File:Hihat123.jpg|thumb|Two hi-hat cymbals mounted in a pedal-operated stand, which allows the drummer to close or open the cymbals.]]\\n\\nHi-hat cymbals (nicknamed \\\"hats\\\") consist of two cymbals mounted, one upside down, with their bottoms facing each other, on a hollow metal support cylinder with folding support legs that keep the support cylinder vertical. Like the bass drum, the hi-hat has a foot pedal. The bottom cymbal is fixed in place. The top cymbal is mounted on a thin rod, which is inserted into the hollow cymbal stand. The thin rod is connected to a foot pedal. When the foot pedal is pressed down, it causes the thin rod to move down, causing the upper cymbal to move and strike the lower. When the foot is lifted off the pedal, the upper cymbal rises, due to the pedal's spring-loaded mechanism. The hi-hats can be sounded by striking the cymbals with one or two sticks or just by closing and opening the cymbals with the foot pedal. The ability to create rhythms on the hi-hats with the foot alone expands the drummer's ability to create sounds, as the hands are freed up to play on the drums or other cymbals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drummagazine.com/birth-of-the-modern-hi-hat/|title=Birth of the Modern Hi-Hat|date=2013-05-16|website=DRUM! Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Different sounds can be created by striking \\\"open hi-hats\\\" (without the pedal depressed, which creates a noisy sound nicknamed \\\"sloppy hats\\\") or a crisp \\\"closed hi-hats\\\" sound (with the pedal pressed down). High hats can also be struck with the pedal partially depressed.\\n\\nA unique effect can be created by striking an open hi-hat (where the two cymbals are apart) and then closing the cymbals with the foot pedal. This effect is widely used in [[disco]] and [[funk]]. The hi-hat has a similar function to the ride cymbal; the two are rarely played consistently for long periods at the same time, but one or the other is often used to keep what is known as the \\\"ride rhythm\\\" (e.g., eighth or sixteenth notes) in a song. The hi-hats are played by the right stick of a right-handed drummer. Changing between ride and hi-hat, or between either and a \\\"leaner\\\" sound with neither, is often used to mark a change from one song section to another.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vetter |first=Roger |title=hi-hat cymbals |url=https://omeka-s.grinnell.edu/s/MusicalInstruments/item/2398 |website=Grinnell College Musical Instrument Collection |access-date=9 July 2023}}</ref>\\n\\n====Crashes====\\n{{main|Crash cymbal}}\\n\\nCrash cymbals are usually the strongest accent markers within the kit, marking crescendos and climaxes, vocal entries, and major changes of mood, swells, and effects. A crash cymbal is often accompanied by a strong kick on the bass drum pedal, both for musical effect and to support the stroke. It provides a fuller sound and is a commonly taught technique.\\n\\nIn jazz, using the smallest kits and at very high volumes, ride cymbals may be played with the technique and sound of a crash cymbal. Some hi-hats will also give a useful crash, particularly thinner hats or those with a severe [[taper (cymbal)|taper]]. Alternatively, specialized crash/ride and ride/crash cymbals are designed to combine both functions.\\n\\n====Other cymbals====\\n\\n=====Effects cymbals=====\\n{{Main|Effects cymbal}}\\n\\nAll cymbals, other than rides, hi-hats, and crashes/splashes, are usually called [[effects cymbal]]s when used in a drum kit, though this is a non-classical or colloquial designation that has become standardized. Most extended kits include one or more [[splash cymbal]]s and at least one [[china cymbal]]. Major cymbal makers produce [[cymbal extension pack]]s consisting of one splash and one china, or more rarely a second crash, a splash, and a china, to match some of their starter packs of ride, crash, and hi-hats. However, any combination of options can be found in the marketplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reverb.com/uk/news/the-evolution-of-the-china-cymbal|title=The Evolution of the China Cymbal|website=reverb.com|date=11 January 2017|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Sabian O-zone cymbal.jpg|thumb|[[Sabian Cymbals|Sabian]] O-zone \\\"vented\\\" crash cymbal]]\\n\\nSome cymbals may be considered effects in some kits but \\\"basic\\\" in another set of components. Likewise, Ozone crashes have the same purpose as a standard crash cymbal, but are considered to be effects cymbals due to their rarity, and the holes cut into them, which provide a darker, more resonant attack.\\n\\n=====Accent cymbals=====\\nCymbals, of any type, used to provide an [[accent (music)|accent]], rather than a regular pattern or [[groove (drumming)|groove]], are known as accent cymbals. While any cymbal can be used to provide an accent, the term is more narrowly applied to cymbals for which the main purpose is to provide an accent. Accent cymbals include chime cymbals, small-bell domed cymbals, and those cymbals with a clear sonorous/oriental chime to them, such as specialized crash, splash, and china cymbals.\\n\\n=====Low-volume cymbals=====\\nLow-volume cymbals are a specialty type of cymbal, made to produce about 80% less volume than a typical cymbal. The entire surface of the cymbal is perforated by holes. Drummers use low-volume cymbals to play in small venues or as a way to practice without disturbing others.\\n\\n===Other acoustic instruments===\\n[[File:G\\u00fcnter Baby Sommer E5100543.jpg|thumb|[[G\\u00fcnter Sommer]] with [[bodhr\\u00e1n]] and [[bongo drums]] in his kit]]\\n\\nOther instruments that have regularly been incorporated into drum kits include:\\n* [[Woodblock (instrument)|Wood block]] and [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]], especially in classic rock and other genres.\\n* [[Tambourine]], particularly mounted on the hi-hat stand above the cymbals; an ordinary tambourine can be used, or a tambourine produced specially for drum kit use.\\n* [[Timbales]] can be used to extend the range of tom-toms, particularly when the drummer owns them for other musical settings; a traditional timbale is tuned far higher than a tom of the same diameter, so the result is not always the most ideal.\\n* [[Keyboard percussion instrument|Keyboard percussion instruments]], such as [[tubular bells]] or a [[glockenspiel]].\\n* [[Gong]]s.\\n* [[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangles]].\\n* [[Found object (music)|Found objects]], including [[wrench|spanners]], [[brake drum]]s, [[bucket]]s, [[cardboard box]]es, [[Washboard (musical instrument)|washboards]], [[drum (container)|oil barrels]], and jam and kerosene [[tin can|tins]] (anything ordinary that can be struck to produce sounds, patterns, and grooves).\\n\\nSee also [[#Extended kits|Extended kits]] below.\\n\\n{{clear}}\\n\\n===Electronic drums===\\n[[File:Clavia ddrum4 SE.jpg|thumb|Triggers sensors in use, here they are red and mounted on the rims of the snare drum, bass drum and hanging toms.

The unit's sound module is mounted to the left.]]\\n\\nElectronic drums are used for many reasons. Some drummers use electronic drums for playing in small venues, such as coffeehouses or church services, where a very low volume for the band is desired. Since fully electronic drums do not create any acoustic sound (apart from the quiet sound of the stick hitting the sensor pads), all of the drum sounds come from a [[keyboard amplifier]] or [[PA system]]; as such, the volume of electronic drums can be much lower than an acoustic kit. Some use electronic drums as practice instruments because they can be listened to with headphones, which enable a drummer to practice without disturbing others. Others use electronic drums to take advantage of the huge range of sounds that modern drum modules can produce, which range from sampled sounds of real drums, cymbals, and percussion instruments such as gongs or [[tubular bells]] that would be impractical to take to a small gig, to electronic and synthesized sounds, including non-instrument sounds such as ocean waves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.electronicdrumadvisor.com/history-electronic-drum-sets-1960s-2010s/|title=The History of Electronic Drum Sets \\u2013 1960s to the 2010s|date=2017-11-18|website=Electronic Drum Advisor|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\\n\\nA fully electronic kit is easier to [[soundcheck]] than acoustic drums, assuming that the electronic drum module has levels that the drummer has preset in their practice room; in contrast, when an acoustic kit is sound checked, most drums and cymbals need to be mic'd and each mic needs to be tested by the drummer so its level and tone equalization can be adjusted by the [[sound engineer]]. Also, even after all the individual drum and cymbal mics are sound checked, the engineer needs to listen to the drummer play a standard groove, to check that the balance between the kit instruments is right. Finally, the engineer needs to set up the monitor mix for the drummer, which the drummer uses to hear their instruments and the instruments and vocals of the rest of the band. With a fully electronic kit, many of these steps can be eliminated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theelectricdrum.wordpress.com/brief-history-of-electronic-drums-part-1/|title=Brief History of Electronic Drums \\u2013 Part 1|date=2015-07-10|website=The Electric Drum|language=en|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\\n\\nDrummers' usage of electronic drum equipment can range from adding a single electronic pad to an entire drum kit (e.g., to have access to an instrument that might otherwise be impractical, such as a large [[gong]]), to using a mix of acoustic drums/cymbals and electronic pads, to using an acoustic kit in which the drums and cymbals have triggers, which can be used to sound electronic drums and other sounds, to having an exclusively electronic kit, which is often set up with the rubber or mesh drum pads and rubber \\\"cymbals\\\" in the usual drum kit locations. A fully electronic kit weighs much less and takes up less space to transport than an acoustic kit and it can be set up more quickly. One of the disadvantages of a fully electronic kit is that it may not have the same \\\"feel\\\" as an acoustic kit, and the drum sounds, even if they are high-quality samples, may not sound the same as acoustic drums.\\n\\nElectronic drum pads are the second most widely used type of [[MIDI]] performance controllers, after electronic keyboards.<ref name=\\\"Manning\\\">Manning, Peter.

''Sound on Sound'' SOS Publications. Aug 1995. Print.</ref> which is possible in two ways:\\n\\n* [[Trigger (drums)|Triggers]] are sensors that can be attached to acoustic drum kit components. In this way, an electronic drum sound will be produced when the instrument is played/struck, as well as the original acoustic sound, if so desired.\\n* [[Trigger pad]]s can be mounted alongside other kit components. These pads make no significant acoustic sound themselves (if not modified to do otherwise), but are used purely to trigger the electronic sounds from the \\\"drum brain\\\". They are played with the same drum sticks as are used on other drum kit components.\\n\\nIn either case, an electronic [[sound module|control unit]] (sound module/\\\"brain\\\") with suitable sampled/modeled or synthesized drum sounds, amplification equipment (a [[PA system]], [[keyboard amp]], etc.), and [[Foldback (sound engineering)|stage monitor]] speakers are required to hear the electronically produced sounds. See [[Electronic drum#Acoustic triggered drum kit|Triggered drum kit]].\\n\\nA trigger pad could contain up to four independent sensors, each of them capable of sending information describing the timing and dynamic intensity of a stroke to the drum module/brain. A circular drum pad may have only one sensor for triggering, but a 2016-era cymbal-shaped rubber pad/cymbal will often contain two; one for the body and one for the bell at the center of the cymbal, and perhaps a [[cymbal choke]] trigger, to allow drummers to produce this effect.\\n\\nTrigger sensors are most commonly used to replace the acoustic drum sounds, but they can also be used effectively with an acoustic kit to augment or supplement an instrument's sound for the needs of the session or show. For example, in a live performance in a difficult acoustical space, a trigger may be placed on each drum or cymbal and used to trigger a similar sound on a [[drum module]]. These sounds are then amplified through a [[Public address system|PA system]] so the audience can hear them, and they can be amplified to any level without the risks of [[audio feedback]] or [[bleed (audio)|bleed]] problems associated with microphones and PAs in certain settings.\\n\\nThe sound of electronic drums and cymbals themselves is heard by the drummer and possibly other musicians in close proximity, but, even so, the [[foldback (sound engineering)|foldback]] (audio monitor) system is usually fed from the electronic sounds rather than the live acoustic sounds. The drums can be heavily dampened (made to resonate less or have the sound subdued), and their tuning and quality is less critical in the latter scenario. In this way, much of the atmosphere of the live performance is retained in a large venue, but without some of the problems associated with purely microphone-amplified drums. Triggers and sensors can also be used in conjunction with conventional or built-in microphones. If some components of a kit prove more difficult to mic than others (e.g., an excessively \\\"boomy\\\" low tom), triggers may be used on only the more difficult instruments, balancing out a drummer's/band's sound in the mix.\\n\\nTrigger pads and drums, on the other hand, when deployed in a conventional set-up, are most commonly used to produce sounds not possible with an acoustic kit, or at least not with what is available. Any sound that can be sampled/recorded can be played when the pad is struck, by assigning the recorded sounds to specific triggers. Recordings or samples of barking dogs, sirens, breaking glass, and stereo recordings of aircraft taking off and landing have all been used. Along with the more obvious electronically generated drums, there are other sounds that (depending on the device used) can also be played/triggered by electronic drums.\\n\\n====Virtual drums====\\nVirtual drums are a type of audio software that simulates the sound of a drum kit using synthesized drum kit sounds or [[Sampling (music)|digital samples]] of acoustic drum sounds. Different drum software products offer a recording function, the ability to select from several acoustically distinctive drum kits (e.g., jazz, rock, metal), as well as the option to incorporate different songs into the session. Some computer software can turn any hard surface into a virtual drum kit using only one microphone.\\n\\n===Hardware===\\n{{main|Drum hardware}}\\n\\nHardware is the name given to the metal stands that support the drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments. Generally, the term also includes the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] pedal and clutch, and [[bass drum pedal]] or pedals, and the [[drum stool]].\\n\\nHardware is carried along with sticks and other accessories in the [[traps case]], and includes:\\n* [[Cymbal stand]]s\\n* [[Hi-hat stand]]\\n* [[Floor tom]] legs\\n* [[Tom-tom drum]] brackets or arms\\n* [[Snare drum stand]]\\n* [[Bass drum pedal]] or pedals\\n* [[Drum key]]\\n* Assorted accessories such as spare washers, cymbal sleeves, wire snare cords, washers for tension rods, etc.\\n\\nMany or even all of the stands may be replaced by a [[drum rack]], which is particularly useful for large drum kits.\\n\\nDrummers often set up their own drum hardware onstage and adjust it to their comfort level. Major bands on tour will often have a [[Guitar technician|drum tech]] who knows how to set up the drummer's hardware and instruments in the desired location and with the desired configuration.\\n\\n==Common configurations==\\n[[File:Th05SuDaBruniesTrio.jpg|thumb|A two-piece kit in action]]\\n\\nDrum kits are traditionally categorized by the number of drums, ignoring cymbals and other instruments. Snare, tom-tom, and bass drums are always counted; other drums, such as octobans, may or may not be counted.<ref name=\\\"Peckman 31\\\">Peckman (2007), p.31.</ref>\\n\\nTraditionally, in America and the United Kingdom, drum sizes are expressed as ''depth x diameter'', both measured in inches. Many drum kit manufacturers have recently been expressing sizes as ''diameter x depth'', still in inches. For example, a [[hanging tom]] 12 inches in diameter and 8 inches deep would be described by Tama as 8 inches \\u00d7 12 inches, but by Pearl as 12 inches \\u00d7 8 inches, and a standard diameter Ludwig snare drum 5 inches deep is a 5-inch \\u00d7 14-inch instrument, while the UK's Premier Manufacturer offers the same dimensions as a 14-inch \\u00d7 5-inch snare. The sizes of drums and cymbals given below are typical. Many instruments differ slightly or radically from them. Where no size is given, it is because there is too much variety to give a typical size.\\n\\n===Three-piece===\\nA three-piece drum set is the most basic set. A conventional three-piece kit consists of a bass drum, a 14\\\"-diameter snare drum, 12\\\"\\u201314\\\" hi-hats, a single 12\\\"-diameter hanging tom, 8\\\"\\u20139\\\" in depth, and a suspended 14\\\"\\u201318\\\" cymbal, the latter two mounted on the bass drum. These kits were common in the 1950s and 1960s and are still used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintageolympic.co.uk/1960.html|title=Vintage Olympic \\u2013 a unique online history of Olympic drums|website=vintageolympic.co.uk|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> It is a common configuration of kits sold through mail order, and, with smaller sized drums and cymbals, of kits for children.\\n\\n===Four-piece===\\n[[File:Jimi Hendrix Experience in Fenklup.png|thumb|[[Mitch Mitchell]] playing a classic four-piece kit in the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]]]]\\n\\nA four-piece kit extends the three-piece by adding one tom, either a second hanging tom mounted on the bass drum (a notable user is [[Chris Frantz]] of [[Talking Heads]]) and often displacing the cymbal, or by adding a floor tom. Normally another cymbal is added as well, so there are separate ride and crash cymbals, either on two stands, or the ride cymbal mounted on the bass drum to the player's right and the crash cymbal on a separate stand. The standard cymbal sizes are 16\\\" for the crash, and 18\\\"\\u201320\\\", ride, with the 20\\\" ride cymbal the most common.\\n\\n====Four piece with floor tom====\\nWhen a floor tom is added to make a four-piece kit, the floor tom is usually 14\\\" for [[jazz]], and 16\\\" otherwise. This configuration is common in jazz and rock. Notable users include [[Ringo Starr]] of [[The Beatles]], [[Mitch Mitchell]] of the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[John Barbata]] of [[the Turtles]], and various jazz drummers throughout the 20th century, including [[Art Blakey]], [[Buddy Rich]], and [[Jo Jones]]. For jazz, which normally emphasizes the use of a [[ride cymbal]] for [[Swing music|swing]] patterns, the lack of second hanging tom in a four-piece kit allows the cymbal to be positioned closer to the drummer, making it easier to play.\\n\\nIf a second hanging tom is used, it is 10\\\" diameter and 8\\\" deep for fusion, or 13\\\" diameter and one inch deeper than for the 12\\\" diameter tom. Otherwise, a 14\\\" diameter hanging tom is added to the 12\\\", both being 8\\\" deep. In any case, both toms are most often mounted on the bass drum with the smaller of the two next to the hi-hats (which are to the left for a right-handed drummer). These kits are particularly useful for smaller venues, where space is limited, such as coffeehouses, caf\\u00e9s, hotel lounges, and small pubs.\\n\\n===Five-piece===\\n[[File:Platin Drums PTCL2016 AF.jpg|thumb|250px|A basic five-piece kit, with one crash cymbal and no effects cymbals, complete with throne and sticks]]\\n\\nThe five-piece kit is the full-size kit and is the most common configuration used across various genres and styles. It adds a third tom to the four-piece kit, making for three toms in all. A fusion kit will normally add a 14\\\" tom, either a floor tom or a hanging tom on a stand to the right of the bass drum; in either case, making the tom lineup 10\\\", 12\\\" and 14\\\". Having three toms enables drummers to have high-, middle-, and low-pitched toms, which gives them more options for fills and solos.\\n\\nOther kits will normally have 12\\\" and 13\\\" hanging toms and either a 14\\\" hanging tom on a stand, a 14\\\" floor tom, or a 16\\\" floor tom. It is common to have 10\\\" and 12\\\" hanging toms, with a 16\\\" floor tom. This configuration is often called a hybrid setup.<ref name=SteveWeiss>Steve Weiss Music {{cite web |url=http://www.steveweissmusic.com/category/drum-sets |title=Drum Sets &#124; Steve Weiss Music |access-date=2012-05-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418150354/http://www.steveweissmusic.com/category/drum-sets |archive-date=18 April 2012 }} 5/10/2012</ref> The bass drum is most commonly 22\\\" in diameter, but rock kits may use 24\\\", fusion 20\\\", jazz 18\\\",<ref name=\\\"Peckman 31\\\" /> and, in larger bands, up to 26\\\". A second crash cymbal is common, typically an inch or two larger or smaller than the 16\\\" one, with the larger of the two to the right for a right-handed drummer. A big band drummer may use crashes up to 20\\\" and a ride up to 24\\\" or, very rarely, 26\\\". A rock kit may also substitute a larger ride cymbal or larger hi-hats, typically 22\\\" for the ride and 15\\\" for the hats.\\n\\nMost five-piece kits, except for entry-level, also have one or more [[effects cymbal]]s. Adding cymbals beyond the basic ride, hi-hats, and one-crash configuration requires more stands, in addition to the standard drum hardware packs. Because of this, many higher-cost kits for professionals are sold with little or no hardware, to allow the drummer to choose the stands and [[bass drum pedal]] they prefer. At the other extreme, many inexpensive, entry-level kits are sold as a five-piece kit complete with two [[cymbal stand]]s, most often one straight and one boom, and some even with a standard cymbal pack, a stool, and a pair of [[5A (drum stick)|5A]] drum sticks. In the 2010s, [[electronic drum|digital]] kits were often offered in a five-piece kit, usually with one plastic crash cymbal trigger and one ride cymbal trigger. Fully electronic drums do not produce any acoustic sound beyond the quiet tapping of sticks on the plastic or rubber heads. Their trigger-pads are wired up to a [[synth module]] or sampler.\\n\\n===Small kits===\\n[[File:Slim Jim Phantom Stray Cats, Sweden 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Slim Jim Phantom]] playing a two-piece kit while standing]]\\n\\nIf the toms are omitted completely, or the bass drum is replaced by a pedal-operated beater on the bottom skin of a floor tom and the hanging toms omitted, the result is a two-piece [[cocktail drum]] kit, originally developed for [[cocktail lounge]] acts. Such kits are particularly favored in musical genres such as [[trad jazz]], [[bebop]], [[rockabilly]], and [[jump blues]]. Some rockabilly kits and beginner kits for very young players omit the hi-hat stand. In rockabilly, this allows the drummer to play standing rather than seated. A very simple jazz kit for informal or amateur [[jam session]]s consists of a bass drum, snare drum, and hi-hat, often with only a single cymbal (normally a ride, with or without [[sizzle cymbal|sizzler]]s).\\n\\nAlthough these kits may be small with respect to the number of drums used, the drums themselves are most often of normal size, or even larger in the case of the bass drum. Kits using smaller drums, in both smaller and larger configurations, are for particular uses, such as boutique kits designed to reduce the visual impact of a large kit, kits that need to fit into small spaces in coffeehouses, traveling kits to reduce luggage volume, and junior kits for very young players. Smaller drums also tend to be quieter, again suiting smaller venues, and many of these kits extend this with extra muffling, which allows for quiet or even silent practice.\\n\\n===Extended kits===\\n[[File:OutsideBRX-15.JPG|right|thumb|200px | A seven-piece kit typically used for [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[jazz fusion]], and [[progressive rock]], consisting of double bass drums, two-floor toms, and an extended set of cymbals (three crashes with [[splash cymbal|splash]] and [[China cymbal|China-type]]).]]\\n[[File:Terry Bozzio drums.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A very large kit played by [[Terry Bozzio]]]]\\n\\nCommon extensions beyond the standard configurations include:\\n* [[Effects cymbal]]s, particularly [[splash cymbal]]s and [[china cymbal]]s\\n* [[Double bass drum]]s or a [[double bass pedal]] are standard for some genres, particularly heavy metal music\\n* Extra hanging or [[rack tom]]s\\n* Extra crash cymbals\\n* A [[crash/ride cymbal]], in addition to the main ride cymbal\\n* A second floor tom, either larger or smaller than the first\\n* One or more [[octoban]]s, or a pair of [[timbales]]\\n* A second pair of hi-hats mounted as [[cable hats]] or [[x-hats]]\\n* [[Cymbal stack]]s\\n* Different types of [[gong]]s\\n* Multiple ride cymbals; a [[sizzle cymbal]], thinner and larger than the main ride, was once common as a second ride or crash/ride, even in a four-piece kit, but is now less so (jazz drummers, however, may still have two or more ride cymbals, even as part of a small kit).\\n* An additional electronic [[sound module]] or [[music sequencer|sequencer]]\\n\\nSee also [[#Other acoustic instruments|other acoustic instruments]] above. Another versatile extension becoming increasingly common is the use of some [[#Electronic drums|electronic drums]] in a mainly acoustic kit.\\n\\nLess common extensions found particularly, but not exclusively, in very large kits, include:\\n* Multiple snare drums, usually in the form of side snares. A side snare is usually positioned to the left of the drummer (opposite the floor toms and to the left of the hi hat). Side snares are used, similarly to effects cymbals, when an additional and different sound is required. Generally only one side snare is used in a kit, if any at all.\\n* Multiple bass drums beyond the double bass drum setup\\n* [[Gong drum]]s (single-headed bass drums, played with sticks or mallets)\\n* Sets of [[gong]]s, tuned or untuned\\n* Sound effects such as a [[thunder sheet]]\\n* One or more [[crotales]]\\n* Instruments \\\"borrowed\\\" from [[orchestral percussion]], such as [[timpani]]\\n* Instruments \\\"borrowed\\\" from [[marching band]] percussion, such as the tuned bass drums used in the [[drumline]]\\n\\n==Accessories==\\n\\n===Sticks===\\n{{main|Drum stick}}\\n[[File:Drum sticks.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tools of the trade: 7N, 5B, \\\"double bummer\\\", and side drum No. 3 sticks, standard 19 cane rutes, sheathed 7 cane rutes, nylon brushes, steel brushes, and cartwheels]]\\n\\nSticks are traditionally made from wood (particularly maple, hickory, and oak), but more recently, metal, carbon fiber, and other materials have been used for sticks. The prototypical wooden drum stick was primarily designed for use with the snare drum, and optimized for playing snare rudiments. Sticks come in a variety of weights and tip designs; 7N is a common jazz stick with a nylon tip, while a 5B is a common wood tipped stick, heavier than a 7N but with a similar profile, and a common standard for beginners. Numbers range from 1 (heaviest) to 10 (lightest).\\n\\nThe meanings of both numbers and letters vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, and some sticks are not described using this system at all, just being known as ''Smooth Jazz'' (typically a 7N or 9N) or ''Speed Rock'' (typically a 2B or 3B) for example. Many famous drummers endorse sticks made to their particular preference and sold under their signature.\\n\\nBesides drumsticks, drummers will also use [[Percussion_mallet#Brushes|brushes]] and [[Rute (music)|Rute]]s in jazz and similar soft music. More rarely, other beaters such as [[cartwheel mallet]]s (known to kit drummers as \\\"soft sticks\\\") may be used. It is not uncommon for rock drummers to use the \\\"wrong\\\" (butt) end of a stick for a heavier sound; some makers produce tipless sticks with two butt ends.\\n\\nA stick bag is the standard way for a drummer to bring drumsticks to a live performance. For easy access, the stick bag is commonly mounted on the side of the floor tom, just within reach of the drummer's right hand, for a right-handed drummer.\\n\\n===Muffles===\\n[[File:Ring muffle on snare.jpg|thumb|Mylar muffle ring on snare]]\\n\\nDrum muffles are types of [[mute (music)|mutes]] that can reduce the ring, boomy [[overtone]] frequencies, or overall volume on a snare, bass, or tom. Controlling the ring is useful in studio or live settings when unwanted frequencies can clash with other instruments in the mix. There are internal and external muffling devices which rest on the inside or outside of the drumhead, respectively. Common types of mufflers include muffling rings, [[Moongel|gels]] and duct tape, and improvised methods, such as placing a wallet near the edge of the head. Some drummers muffle the sound of a drum by putting a cloth over the drumhead.\\n\\n'''Snare drum and tom-tom'''\\nTypical ways to muffle a snare or tom include placing an object on the outer edge of the drumhead. A piece of cloth, a wallet, gel, or fitted rings made of [[BoPET|mylar]] are common objects. Also used are external clip-on muffles. Internal mufflers that lie on the inside of the drumhead are often built into a drum, but are generally considered less effective than external muffles, as they stifle the initial tone, rather than simply reducing its sustain.\\n\\n'''Bass drum'''\\nMuffling the bass can be achieved with the same muffling techniques as for the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly muffled by adding pillows, a sleeping bag, or other soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows the manipulation of internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.\\n\\n'''Silencers/mutes'''\\nAnother type of drum muffler is a piece of rubber that fits over the entire drumhead or cymbal. It interrupts contact between the stick and the head, which dampens the sound. They are typically used in practice settings.\\n\\n'''Cymbals''' are usually muted with the fingers or hand, to reduce the length or volume of ringing (e.g., the cymbal choke technique which is a key part of heavy metal drumming). Cymbals can also be muted with special rubber rings or duct tape.\\n\\n'''Historical uses'''\\nMuffled drums are often associated with funeral ceremonies as well, such as the funerals of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/funeral-of-queen-victoria |title=Funeral of Queen Victoria \\u2013 British Path\\u00e9 |publisher=Britishpathe.com |date=2010-07-18 |access-date=2014-07-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704180143/http://www.britishpathe.com/video/funeral-of-queen-victoria |archive-date=4 July 2014 }}</ref> The use of muffled drums has been written about by such poets as [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[John Mayne]], and [[Theodore O'Hara]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Poetry/PsalmA.htm |title=Longfellow's \\\"A Psalm of Life\\\" |publisher=Blupete.com |access-date=2014-07-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101233134/http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Poetry/PsalmA.htm |archive-date=1 January 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/warpoetry/1805/1805_4.html |title=1805.4 \\u2013 \\\"The Muffled Drum\\\" &#124; Romantic Circles |date=September 2004 |publisher=Rc.umd.edu |access-date=2014-07-28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521214224/http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/warpoetry/1805/1805_4.html |archive-date=21 May 2014 }}</ref> Drums have also been used for therapy and learning purposes, such as when an experienced player will sit with a number of students and by the end of the session have all of them relaxed and playing complex rhythms.<ref>Ryan , A. (n.d.). Learning to play the drum: an experiential. 43(4), 435\\u2013444.</ref>\\n\\n===Stick holder===\\nThere are various types of stick holder accessories, including bags that can be attached to a drum and angled sheath-style stick holders, which can hold a single pair of sticks.\\n\\n===Sizzlers===\\n[[File:aasizzler2.jpg|thumb|150px|Paiste 2002 18\\\" medium cymbal fitted with a chain sizzler]]\\n\\nA [[sizzler (percussion)|sizzler]] is a metal chain, or combination of chains, that is hung across a cymbal, creating a distinctive metallic sound when the cymbal is struck, similar to that of a [[sizzle cymbal]]. Using a sizzler is the non-destructive alternative to drilling holes in a cymbal and putting metal rivets in the holes. Another benefit of using a \\\"sizzler\\\" chain is that the chain is removable, with the cymbal being easily returned to its normal sound.\\n\\nSome sizzlers feature pivoting arms that allow the chains to be quickly lowered onto, or raised from, the cymbal, allowing the effect to be used for some songs and removed for others.\\n\\n===Cases===\\n{{Main|Drum case}}\\n[[File:Drum kit cases.JPG|thumb|From left: traps case, floor tom case, snare case (front), twin hanging toms case, cymbal case, bass drum case (rear)]]\\n\\nThree types of protective covers are common for kit drums:\\n* Drum bags are made from robust cloth such as [[cordura]] or from cloth-backed vinyl. They give minimal protection from bumps and impacts, but they do protect drums and cymbals from precipitation. They are adequate for drums transported in private vehicles to local gigs and sessions. They are often the only option for young drummers who are just starting out.\\n* Mid-price hard cases are of similar construction to suitcases, commonly made of fiber composite. The offer more protection from bumps than cloth bags.\\n* [[Flight case]]s or [[road case]]s are standard for professional touring drummers.\\n\\nAs with all musical instruments, the best protection is provided by a combination of a hard-shelled case with interior padding, such as foam, next to the drums and cymbals.\\n\\n===Microphones===\\n[[File:Carl Palmer.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Palmer]] with rim-mounted tom mics]]\\n\\n[[Microphone]]s (\\\"mics\\\") are used with drum kits to pick up the sound of the drums and cymbals for a [[sound recording]] and/or to pick up the sound of the drum kit so that it can be amplified through a [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]]. While most drummers use microphones and amplification in live shows, so that the [[sound engineer]] can adjust the levels of the drums and cymbals, some bands that play quieter genres of music and in small venues, such as coffeehouses, play acoustically, without mics or PA amplification. Small jazz groups, such as [[jazz quartet]]s or [[organ trio]]s that are playing in a small bar, will often just use acoustic drums. Of course, if the same small jazz groups play on the mainstage of a big jazz festival, the drums will be miced so that they can be adjusted in the sound system mix. A middle-ground approach is used by some bands that play in small venues: they do not mic every drum and cymbal, but only the instruments that the sound engineer wants to be able to control in the mix, such as the bass drum and the snare.\\n\\nIn miking a drum kit, [[dynamic microphone]]s, which can handle high sound-pressure levels, are usually used to close-mic drums, which is predominantly the way to mic drums for live shows. [[Condenser microphone]]s are used for overheads and room mics, an approach which is more common with sound recording applications. Close miking of drums may be done using stands or by mounting the microphones on the rims of the drums, or even using microphones built into the drum itself, which eliminates the need for stands for such microphones, reducing both clutter and set-up time, as well as better isolating them.\\n\\nFor some styles of music, drummers use electronic effects on drums, such as individual [[noise gate]]s that mute the attached microphone when the signal is below a threshold volume. This allows the sound engineer to use a higher overall volume for the drum kit by reducing the number of \\\"active\\\" mics which could produce unwanted [[Acoustic feedback|feedback]] at any one time. When a drum kit is entirely miked and amplified through the sound reinforcement system, the drummer or the sound engineer can add other [[effect units|electronic effects]] to the drum sound, such as [[reverb]] or [[digital delay]].\\n\\nSome drummers arrive at the venue with their drum kit and use the mics and mic stands provided by the venue's sound engineer. Other drummers bring all their own mics, or selected mics (e.g., good-quality snare and bass drum mics), to ensure that they have good quality mics on hand. In bars and nightclubs, the microphones supplied by the venue can sometimes be in substandard condition, due to the heavy use they experience.\\n\\n===Monitors===\\nDrummers using electronic drums, drum machines, or hybrid acoustic-electric kits (which blend traditional acoustic drums and cymbals with electronic pads) typically use a monitor speaker, keyboard amplifier, or even a small PA system to hear the electronic drum sounds. Even a drummer playing entirely acoustic drums may use a monitor speaker to hear the drums, especially if playing in a loud rock or metal band, where there is substantial onstage volume from large, powerful [[Guitar_amplifier#Stacks|guitar stacks]]. Drummers are often given a large speaker cabinet with a 15\\\" subwoofer to help them monitor their bass drum sound (along with a full-range monitor speaker to hear the rest of their kit). Some sound engineers and drummers prefer to use an electronic vibration system, colloquially known as a \\\"[[butt shaker]]\\\" or \\\"throne thumper\\\" to monitor the bass drum, because this lowers the stage volume. With a \\\"butt shaker\\\", the \\\"thump\\\" of each bass drum strike causes a vibration in the drum stool; this way the drummer ''feels'' their beat on the posterior, rather than hears it.\\n\\n[[In-ear monitor|In-Ear Monitors]] are also popular among drummers since they also work as earplugs.\\n\\n===Bass drum gear===\\nA number of accessories are designed for the bass drum. The bass drum can take advantage of the [[bass reflex]] speaker design, in which a tuned port (a hole and a carefully measured tube) are put in a [[speaker enclosure]] to improve the bass response at the lowest frequencies. Bass drumhead patches protect the drumhead from the impact of the felt beater. Bass drum pillows are fabric bags with filling or stuffing that can be used to alter the tone or resonance of the bass drum. A less expensive alternative to using a specialized bass drum pillow is to use an old sleeping bag.\\n\\n===Gloves===\\nSome drummers wear special drummer's gloves to improve their grip on the sticks when they play. Drumming gloves often have a textured grip surface made of a synthetic or rubber material and mesh or vents on the parts of the glove not used to hold sticks, to ventilate perspiration. Some drummers wear gloves to prevent blisters.\\n\\n===Drum screen===\\n{{main|Drum screen}}\\n\\nIn some styles or settings\\u2014such as country music clubs or churches, small venues, or when a live recording is being made\\u2014the drummer may use a transparent [[Perspex]] or [[Plexiglas]] ''drum screen'' (also known as a ''drum shield'') to dampen the onstage volume of the drums. A screen that completely surrounds the drum kit is known as a ''drum booth''. In live sound applications, drum shields are used so that the audio engineer can have more control over the volume of drums that the audience hears through the PA system mix, or to reduce the overall volume of the drums, as a way to reduce the overall volume of the band. In some recording studios, foam and fabric baffles are used in addition to, or in place of, clear panels. The drawback with foam/cloth baffle panels is that the drummer cannot see well other performers, the record producer, or the audio engineer.\\n\\n===Carpets===\\nDrummers often bring a carpet, mats, or rugs to venues to prevent the bass drum and hi-hat stand from \\\"crawling\\\" (moving away) on a slippery surface, which can be caused by the drum head striking the bass drum. The carpet also reduces short reverberations (which is generally but not always an advantage), and helps to prevent damage to the flooring or floor coverings. In shows where multiple drummers will bring their kits onstage over the night, it is common for drummers to mark the location of their stands and pedals with tape, to allow for quicker positioning of a kit to a drummer's accustomed position. Bass drums and hi-hat stands commonly have retractable spikes, to help them grip surfaces such as carpet, or rubber feet, to remain stationary on hard surfaces.\\n\\n===Practice equipment===\\nDrummers use a variety of accessories when practicing. Metronomes and beat counters are used to develop a sense of a steady beat. Drum muffling pads may be used to lessen the volume of drums during practicing. A [[practice pad]], held on the lap, on a leg, or mounted on a stand, is used for near-silent practice with drumsticks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdrummingsystem.com/underground/drum-articles/practice-pad-use.php|title=Practice Pad {{!}} Learn To Use A Practice Pad Effectively|website=rockdrummingsystem.com|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> A set of practice pads mounted to simulate an entire drum kit is known as a practice kit. In the 2010s, these have largely been superseded by electronic drums, which can be listened to with headphones for quiet practice and by kits with non-sounding mesh heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/electronic-drums-market|title=Electronic Drums Market Insight, Size, Forecast to 2024|website=psmarketresearch.com|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\\n\\n===Tuning equipment===\\n{{main|Drum key}}\\n[[File:ARNO DRUM KEYS COLLECTION Custom Drum Key.jpg|thumb|100px|An Arno drum key]]\\n\\nDrummers use a [[drum key]] for tuning their drums and adjusting some drum hardware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagedrumguide.com/article-drum-tuning.html|title=Vintage Snare Drums online Ludwig, Slingerland, Leedy, Camco, Gretsch, Sonor|website=vintagedrumguide.com|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Besides the basic type of drum key (a T-handled wrench) there are various tuning wrenches and tools. Basic drum keys are divided into three types which allows for tuning of three types of tuning screws on drums: square (most used), slotted, and hexagonal. Ratchet-type wrenches allow high-tension drums to be tuned easily. Spin keys (utilizing a ball joint) allow for rapid head changing. Torque-wrench keys are available, graphically revealing the torque given to each lug. Also, tension gauges, or meters, which are set on the head, aid drummers to achieve a consistent tuning. Drummers can tune drums \\\"[[Playing by ear|by ear]]\\\" or use a digital drum tuner, which \\\"measures tympanic pressure\\\" on the drumhead to provide accurate tuning.\\n\\n===Notation and improvisation===\\n{{main|Percussion notation|Musical improvisation}}\\n{{Image frame|content=<score raw=\\\"1\\\" sound=\\\"1\\\">\\n\\\\version \\\"2.22.0\\\"\\n\\\\header { tagline = ##f}\\n\\\\score {\\n  \\\\drums \\\\with {midiInstrument = \\\"drums\\\"}\\n  \\\\with { \\\\numericTimeSignature }\\n  {\\n    \\\\repeat volta 2 {\\n      <<\\n        \\\\tempo 4 = 80-160\\n        \\\\bar \\\".|:\\\"\\n        {\\n          cymra8 [cymra] cymra [cymra]  cymra [cymra] cymra [cymra]\\n        }\\\\\\\\{bd4 sne bd sne}\\n      >>\\\\break\\n    }\\n  }\\n  \\\\layout {}\\n}\\n\\\\score {\\n  \\\\unfoldRepeats {\\n    \\\\drums \\\\with {midiInstrument = \\\"drums\\\"}{\\n      \\\\repeat volta 2 {\\n\\n        <<\\n          \\\\tempo 4 = 80-160\\n          \\\\bar \\\".|:\\\"\\n          {\\n            cymra8 [cymra] cymra [cymra]  cymra [cymra] cymra [cymra]\\n          }\\\\\\\\{bd4 sne bd sne}\\n        >>\\\\break\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n  \\\\midi { \\\\tempo  4 = 90 }\\n}\\n</score>|width=300|align=right|caption=The basic [[common time]] groove with bass (bottom), back beat snare, and cymbal (top) is common in popular music.|max-width=300}}\\n\\nDrum kit music is either written in music notation (called \\\"drum parts\\\"), learned and played by ear, improvised, or some combination of any of all three of these methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drummagazine.com/drum-notation-guide/|title=Drum Notation Guide|date=2009-08-18|website=DRUM! Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Professional session musician drummers and big-band drummers are often required to read drum parts. Drum parts are most commonly written on a standard five-line staff. As of 2016, a special ''percussion clef'' is used, while previously the bass clef was used. However, even if the bass, or no, clef is used, each line and space is assigned an instrument in the kit, rather than a pitch. In jazz, traditional music, folk music, rock music, and pop music, drummers are expected to be able to learn songs by ear (from a recording or from another musician who is playing or singing the song) and improvise. The degree of improvisation differs among different styles. Jazz and jazz fusion drummers may have lengthy improvised solos in every song. In rock music and blues, there are also drum solos in some songs, although they tend to be shorter than those in jazz. Drummers in all popular music and traditional music styles are expected to be able to improvise accompaniment parts to songs, once they are told the genre or style (e.g., shuffle, ballad, blues).\\n\\n===Recording===\\nOn early recording media (until 1925),<ref name=\\\"Hazel 1993 p.44\\\">Porter/Hullman/Hazel (1993).

Once the drums are recorded, the other instruments (rhythm guitar, piano, etc.), and then vocals, are added. To ensure that the drum tempo is consistent at this type of recording, the drummer usually plays along with a [[click track]] (a type of digital [[metronome]]) in headphones. The ability to play accurately along with a click track has become an important skill for professional drummers.\\n\\n==Drum manufacturers==\\n{{Main|List of drum manufacturers}}\\nManufacturers using the American traditional format in their catalogs include these:\\n* [[ddrum]]\\n* [[Camco Drum Company|Camco]]\\n* [[Drum Workshop]]\\n* [[Gretsch Drums]]\\n* [[Ludwig-Musser]]\\n* [[Slingerland Drum Company]]\\n* [[Tama Drums]]\\nThose using the European measures of diameter and depth include these:\\n* [[Brady Drum Company]]\\n* [[Mapex Drums]]\\n* [[Meinl Percussion]]\\n* [[Pearl Drums]]\\n* [[Premier Percussion]]\\n* [[Rogers Drums]]\\n* [[Sonor]]\\n* [[Yamaha Drums]]\\n\\n==See also==\\n===People===\\n* [[Drummer]]\\n* [[List of drummers]]\\n\\n===Styles and techniques===\\n* [[Drum beat]]\\n* [[Jazz drumming]]\\n\\n===Other===\\n{{div col|content=\\n* [[Drum kit tuning]]\\n* [[Percussion instrument]]\\n* [[Rhythm section]]\\n* [[Electronic drum]]\\n* [[Drum machine]]\\n}}\\n\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{notelist}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n{{commons category|Drum-kits}}\\n* \\\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5-C4S0keC0&list=PLpKMeH_MXcaSL7sTLRAzOaWf6NLQgX9W4 History of the Drum Set]\\\" with [[Daniel Glass (drummer)|Daniel Glass]] on [[YouTube]]\\n\\n{{Drum beats}}\\n{{Percussion}}\\n\\n{{Authority control}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum Kit}}\\n[[Category:19th-century percussion instruments]]\\n[[Category:Blues instruments]]\\n[[Category:Cymbals]]\\n[[Category:Drum kit components| ]]\\n[[Category:Drum kits| ]]\\n[[Category:Drumming]]\\n[[Category:Drums]]\\n[[Category:Electronic musical instruments]]\\n[[Category:Folk music instruments]]\\n[[Category:Jazz instruments]]\\n[[Category:Membranophones]]\\n[[Category:North American percussion instruments]]\\n[[Category:Occupations in music]]\\n[[Category:Rhythm section]]\\n[[Category:Rock music instruments]]\\n[[Category:Rockabilly instruments]]\",\n          \"{{short description|American musical group}}\\n{{Distinguish|text=[[Earth and Fire]], a Dutch rock and pop group}}\\n{{for-multi|the elements|Classical element|the BoyNextDoor song|Earth, Wind & Fire (song)|the 2013 Cappadonna album|Eyrth, Wynd and Fyre{{!}}''Eyrth, Wynd and Fyre''}}\\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2023}}\\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\\n| name              = Earth, Wind & Fire\\n| image             = Earth, Wind & Fire (2).jpg\\n| landscape         = yes\\n| caption           = Earth, Wind & Fire performing in 2009\\n| alias             = {{flatlist|\\n*EW&F\\n*EWF\\n}}\\n| origin            = [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], U.S.\\n| genre             = {{flatlist| \\n* [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]\\n* [[Soul music|soul]]\\n* [[funk]]\\n* [[Pop music|pop]]\\n* [[disco]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mixmag.net/read/earth-wind-fire-drummer-fred-white-died-aged-67-news|title=Earth, Wind & Fire Drummer Fred White has died, aged 67|website=Mixmag}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smoothradio.com/features/top-songs/earth-wind-fires-songs-best-ranked/|title=Earth Wind & Fire's 10 greatest songs ever, ranked|website=Smooth}}</ref>\\n* [[progressive soul]]<ref>{{cite web|last=King|first=Jason|date=February 5, 2016|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/02/05/465703176/maurice-white-the-audacity-of-uplift|title=Maurice White: The Audacity of Uplift|website=[[NPR Music]]|access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref>\\n}}\\n| years_active      = 1969\\u2013present<br>(hiatus mid-1984 to mid-1987)\\n| label             = {{flatlist|\\n* [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]]\\n* [[ARC Records|ARC]]\\n* [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]\\n* [[Kalimba Music|Kalimba]]\\n* [[Sanctuary Records|Sanctuary]]\\n}}\\n| associated_acts   = {{flatlist|\\n* [[Ramsey Lewis]]\\n* [[The Emotions]]\\n* [[David Foster]]\\n* [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]\\n}}\\n| website           = {{URL|earthwindandfire.com}}\\n| current_members   =\\n* [[Verdine White]]\\n* [[Philip Bailey]]\\n* [[Ralph Johnson (musician)|Ralph Johnson]]\\n* B.

It is maintained by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was first published in 1988, with updates in 1991, 2000, 2004, and 2019, and an amendment in 2022.<ref name=\\\"iso8601amd1\\\" /> The standard provides a well-defined, unambiguous method of representing calendar dates and times in worldwide communications, especially to avoid misinterpreting numeric dates and times when such data is transferred between [[Date and time representation by country|countries with different conventions]] for writing numeric dates and times.\\n\\nISO&nbsp;8601 applies to these representations and formats: ''dates'', in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendar (including the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic Gregorian]] calendar); ''times'', based on the [[24-hour clock|24-hour timekeeping system]], with optional [[UTC offset]]; ''[[time interval]]s''; and combinations thereof.<ref name=scope>ISO 8601:2004[E] section 1 Scope</ref> The standard does not assign specific meaning to any element of the dates/times represented: the meaning of any element depends on the context of its use. Dates and times represented cannot use words that do not have a specified numerical meaning within the standard (thus excluding [[Chinese calendar correspondence table|names of years]] in the [[Chinese calendar]]), or that do not use [[Character (computing)|computer characters]] (excludes images or sounds).<ref name=scope />\\n\\nIn representations that adhere to the ISO&nbsp;8601 ''interchange standard'', dates and times are arranged such that the greatest temporal term (typically a year) is placed at the left and each successively lesser term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be written in a combination of [[Arabic numerals]] and the specific computer characters (such as \\\"{{not a typo|&hyphen;}}\\\",<!-- U+2010 hyphen per ISO --> \\\":\\\", \\\"T\\\", \\\"W\\\", \\\"Z\\\") that are assigned specific meanings within the standard; that is, such commonplace descriptors of dates (or parts of dates) as \\\"January\\\", \\\"Thursday\\\", or \\\"New Year's Day\\\" are not allowed in interchange representations within the standard.\\n\\n==History==\\nThe first edition of the ISO&nbsp;8601 standard was published as ''ISO&nbsp;8601:1988'' in 1988. It unified and replaced a number of older ISO standards on various aspects of date and time notation: [[ISO 2014]], [[ISO 2015]], [[ISO 2711]], [[ISO 3307]], and [[ISO 4031]].<ref name=doc2004>{{citation\\n |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\\n |date=2004-12-01\\n |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\\n |quote=Annex&nbsp;A: ...

This allows dates to be naturally [[sorting|sorted]] by, for example, file systems.\\n*Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with [[leading zero]]s.\\n*Representations can be done in one of two formats{{spaced ndash}}a ''basic format'' with a minimal number of separators or an ''extended format'' with separators added to enhance human readability.<ref name=isofaqtnd>ISO: \\\"[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 ISO 8601 \\u2014 Date and time format]\\\". {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308153102/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 |date=2013-03-08 }}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime|title=Date and Time Formats|website=[[w3.org|W3C]]|date=15 September 1997 |first1=Misha |last1=Wolf |first2=Charles |last2=Wicksteed |access-date=11 May 2021|archive-date=10 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510231523/https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime|url-status=live}}</ref> The standard notes that \\\"The basic format should be avoided in [[plain text]].\\\"<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 2.3.3 basic format</ref> The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the [[hyphen]], while the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds).<!--dead link: [http://lists.ebxml.org/archives/ebxml-core/200104/pdf00005.pdf]--> For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as {{nowrap|\\\"2009-01-06\\\"}} in the extended format or simply as \\\"20090106\\\" in the basic format without ambiguity.\\n*{{anchor|Reduced precision}} For reduced [[precision and accuracy|precision]],<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision>Earlier versions of ISO&nbsp;8601 used the word ''accuracy'', not ''precision'', in the relevant section, e.g: 2.3.7 representation with reduced accuracy.

[YYYY] indicates the ''ISO week-numbering year'' which is slightly different from the traditional [[Gregorian calendar]] year (see below). [Www] is the ''[[week number]]'' prefixed by the letter ''W'', from W01 through W53. [D] is the ''weekday number'', from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.\\n\\nThere are several mutually equivalent and compatible descriptions of week 01:\\n* the week with the first [[business day]] in the starting year (considering that Saturdays, Sundays and 1 January are non-working days),\\n* the week with the starting year's first Thursday in it (the formal ISO definition),\\n* the week with 4 January in it,\\n* the first week with the majority (four or more) of its days in the starting year, and\\n* the week starting with the Monday in the period 29 December - 4 January.\\n\\nAs a consequence, if 1 January is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in week 01. If 1 January is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, it is in week 52 or 53 of the previous year (there is no week 00). 28 December is always in the last week of its year.\\n\\nThe week number can be described by counting the Thursdays: week 12 contains the 12th Thursday of the year.\\n\\nThe ''ISO week-numbering year'' starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. The first ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is ending; if three, they are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Similarly, the last ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is starting; if three, they are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The Thursday of each ISO week is always in the Gregorian calendar year denoted by the ISO week-numbering year.\\n\\nExamples:\\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2008-12-29}} is written \\\"{{#time: o-\\\"W\\\"W-N|2008-12-29}}\\\"\\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2010-01-03}} is written \\\"{{#time: o-\\\"W\\\"W-N|2010-01-03}}\\\"\\n\\n===Ordinal dates===\\n{| class=\\\"infobox\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center; width:23em\\\"\\n| YYYY-DDD ||''or''|| YYYYDDD\\n|}\\n\\nAn ''[[ordinal date]]'' is an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] format for the multiples of a day elapsed since the start of year.\\nIt is represented as \\\"YYYY-DDD\\\" (or YYYYDDD), where [YYYY] indicates a year and [DDD] is the \\\"day of year\\\", from 001 through 365 (366 in [[leap year]]s). For example, {{nowrap|\\\"1981-04-05\\\"}} is the same as {{nowrap|\\\"1981-095\\\"}}.\\n\\nThis simple form is preferable for occasions when the arbitrary nature of week and month definitions are more of an impediment than an aid, for instance, when comparing dates from different calendars. \\nThis format is used with simple hardware systems that have a need for a date system, but where including full calendar calculation software may be a significant nuisance. This system is sometimes referred to as \\\"Julian Date\\\", but this can cause confusion with the astronomical [[Julian day]], a sequential count of the number of days since day 0 beginning {{nowrap|1 January 4713 BC}} Greenwich noon, Julian proleptic calendar (or noon on ISO date {{nowrap|\\u22124713-11-24}} which uses the Gregorian proleptic calendar with a year 0000).\\n\\n==Times==\\n{| class=\\\"infobox\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center; width:23em\\\"\\n|Thh:mm:ss.sss\\n|''or''\\n|Thhmmss.sss\\n|-\\n| Thh:mm:ss ||''or''|| Thhmmss\\n|-\\n| Thh:mm.mmm ||''or''|| Thhmm.mmm\\n|-\\n| Thh:mm ||''or''|| Thhmm\\n|-\\n| Thh.hhh ||  || \\n|-\\n| Thh ||  || \\n|-\\n| colspan=3 | '''In unambiguous contexts*'''\\n|-\\n|hh:mm:ss.sss\\n|''or''\\n|hhmmss.sss*\\n|-\\n| hh:mm:ss ||''or''|| hhmmss*\\n|-\\n| hh:mm ||''or''|| hhmm*\\n|-\\n| hh* ||  || \\n|- \\n| colspan=3 | <small>* Unambiguous here because they are in the ''Times'' section of this Wikipedia article.</small>\\n|}\\n\\nISO&nbsp;8601 uses the [[24-hour clock]] system.

The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration (as described in the previous section). The two time points (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time representation or just a date representation.\\n\\nThere are four ways to express a time interval:\\n\\n#Start and end, such as \\\"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\\\"\\n#Start and duration, such as \\\"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\\\"\\n#Duration and end, such as \\\"P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\\\"\\n#Duration only, such as \\\"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\\\", with additional context information\\n\\nOf these, the first three require two values separated by an ''interval designator'' which is usually a solidus (more commonly referred to as a [[slash (punctuation)|forward slash]] \\\"/\\\"). Section 3.2.6 of ISO&nbsp;8601-1:2019 notes that \\\"A solidus may be replaced by a double hyphen [\\\"--\\\"] by mutual agreement of the communicating partners\\\", and previous versions used notations like \\\"2000--2002\\\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jkorpela.fi/iso8601.html |title=Info on ISO 8601, the date and time representation standard |publisher=Cs.tut.fi |access-date=2012-08-29 |archive-date=2017-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014035101/http://jkorpela.fi/iso8601.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Use of a double hyphen instead of a solidus allows inclusion in computer [[filename]]s;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogold.com.au/news_2012.html#iso8601 |title=ISO 8601 - Getting with the Times (and Dates) |date=2012-01-01 |publisher=Hydrogold |access-date=2013-08-13 |archive-date=2014-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125104222/http://hydrogold.com.au/news_2012.html#iso8601 |url-status=live }}</ref> in common operating systems, a solidus is a [[Filename#Reserved characters and words|reserved character]] and is not allowed in a filename.\\n\\nFor <start>/<end> expressions, if any elements are missing from the end value, they are assumed to be the same as for the start value including the time zone. This feature of the standard allows for concise representations of time intervals. For example, the date of a two-hour meeting including the start and finish times could be simply shown as \\\"2007-12-14T13:30/15:30\\\", where \\\"/15:30\\\" implies \\\"/2007-12-14T15:30\\\" (the same date as the start), or the beginning and end dates of a monthly billing period as \\\"2008-02-15/03-14\\\", where \\\"/03-14\\\" implies \\\"/2008-03-14\\\" (the same year as the start).\\n\\nIf greater precision is desirable to represent the time interval, then more time elements can be added to the representation. An interval denoted {{nowrap|\\\"2007-11-13/15\\\"}} can start at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-13}} and end at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-15}}, whereas {{nowrap|\\\"2007-11-13T09:00/15T17:00\\\"}} includes the start and end times.\\nTo explicitly include all of the start and end dates, the interval would be represented as {{nowrap|\\\"2007-11-13T00:00/16T00:00\\\"}}.\\n\\n===Repeating intervals===\\n{| class=\\\"infobox\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center; width:23em\\\"\\n|-\\n| Rn/<interval>\\n|-\\n| R/<interval>\\n|}\\nRepeating intervals are specified in clause \\\"4.5 Recurring time interval\\\". They are formed by adding \\\"R[n]/\\\" to the beginning of an interval expression, where ''R'' is used as the letter itself and [n] is replaced by the number of repetitions. Leaving out the value for [n] or specifying a value of -1, means an unbounded number of repetitions. A value of 0 for [n] means the interval is not repeated.\\n\\nIf the interval specifies the start (forms 1 and 2 above), then this is the start of the repeating interval. If the interval specifies the end but not the start (form 3 above), then this is the end of the repeating interval. For example, to repeat the interval of \\\"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\\\" five times starting at {{nowrap|\\\"2008-03-01T13:00:00Z\\\"}}, use {{nowrap|\\\"R5/2008-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\\\"}}.\\n\\n=={{anchor|Truncated representations}}Truncated representations (deprecated)==\\n{{distinguish|#Reduced precision}}\\n\\nISO&nbsp;8601:2000 allowed truncation (by agreement), where leading components of a date or time are omitted.

The inclusion of time zone names is particularly useful for applications that need to account for events like daylight saving time transitions. Furthermore, IXDTF maintains compatibility with pre-existing syntax for attaching time zone names to timestamps, providing a standardized and flexible approach to timestamp representation on the internet. Example:\\n\\n<code>1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]</code>\\n\\n=== Adoption as national standards ===\\n<!-- If possible, please specify revisions and release dates as well.

In October, the Bucks played their first NBA regular-season game against the [[Chicago Bulls]] before a [[Milwaukee Arena]] crowd of 8,467. As is typical with expansion teams, the Bucks' first season ([[1968\\u201369 NBA season|1968\\u201369]]) was a struggle. Their first victory came in their sixth game as the Bucks beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] 134\\u2013118; they won only 26 more games in their first year. That year, the Bucks' record earned them a coin flip against their expansion cousins, the [[Phoenix Suns]], to see who would get the first pick in the upcoming draft. It was considered a foregone conclusion that the first pick in the draft would be [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]] of [[UCLA]]. The Bucks won the coin flip, but had to win a bidding war with the [[Brooklyn Nets|New York Nets]] of the upstart [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) to secure him.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/it-took-a-hustler-a-native-son-a-priests-blessing-and-a-city-hungry-for-sports-to-bring-the-bucks-to-milwaukee/ar-AALO4xT|title = It took a hustler, a native son, a priest's blessing and a city hungry for sports to bring the Bucks to Milwaukee|website = [[MSN]]|access-date = November 19, 2021|archive-date = November 19, 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211119145122/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/it-took-a-hustler-a-native-son-a-priests-blessing-and-a-city-hungry-for-sports-to-bring-the-bucks-to-milwaukee/ar-AALO4xT|url-status = live}}</ref>\\n\\n===1969\\u20131975: The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era===\\n{{multiple image\\n| align = right\\n| direction = horizontal\\n| width = 150\\n| total_width = 300\\n| image1 = Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 1974.jpeg\\n| image2 = Oscar Robertson Bucks.jpeg\\n| caption1 = During his six seasons with the Bucks, [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] averaged 30.4 points and 15.3 rebounds per game.\\n| caption2 = [[Oscar Robertson]] was a key member of the Championship-winning [[1970\\u201371 Milwaukee Bucks season|1970\\u201371 Milwaukee Bucks]]\\n| caption_align = center\\n| footer = \\n| footer_align = centre\\n| alt1 = \\n}}\\n\\nWith the addition of Alcindor, the Bucks finished with a 56\\u201326 record in [[1969\\u201370 NBA season|1969\\u201370]], second-best in the league behind the [[New York Knicks]]. Not only was this a near-reversal of their inaugural season, but the 29-game improvement was the best in league history \\u2013 a record which would stand for ten years until the [[Boston Celtics]] jumped from 29 wins in [[1978\\u201379 NBA season|1978\\u201379]] to 61 in [[1979\\u201380 NBA season|1979\\u201380]]. The Bucks defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals, only to be dispatched in five by the Knicks in the Eastern finals. Alcindor was a runaway selection for [[NBA Rookie of the Year]].\\n\\n[[1970\\u201371 NBA season|The following season]], the Bucks traded for [[Cincinnati Royals]] guard [[Oscar Robertson]] to complement Alcindor. Subsequently, the Bucks, now in the Western Conference, finished 66\\u201316, the second-most wins in NBA history at the time, and still a franchise record. During the regular season, the Bucks recorded a then-NBA record [[List of National Basketball Association longest winning streaks|20-game win streak]]. Posting a 12\\u20132 record in the playoffs, they won their first NBA championship on April 30, 1971, by sweeping the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]] in four games. By winning the championship in only their third season, the Bucks became one of the fastest true expansion teams in North American professional sports history to win a league championship.\\n\\nThe Bucks remained a powerhouse for the first half of the 1970s. In 1972, Alcindor, who had already privately converted to Islam and changed his name, publicly announced his name change to [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. The Bucks reached the division/conference finals for the third year in a row, but lost to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in six games. In 1973, they recorded their third consecutive 60-win season, the first NBA team to do so, but injuries resulted in an early playoff exit. The Bucks were back in the [[1974 NBA Finals]] against the Celtics. In game six of the series, Abdul-Jabbar made his famous \\\"[[Hook shot|sky hook]]\\\" shot in a classic double-overtime victory. However, the Bucks then lost in game seven, and did not return to the NBA Finals until 2021.\\n\\nAs the 1974\\u20131975 season began, Abdul-Jabbar suffered a hand injury and the Bucks got off to a 3\\u201313 start. After his return, other injuries befell the team, sending them to the bottom of their division with a 38-44 record. When the season ended, Abdul-Jabbar announced that he no longer wished to play for the Bucks and wanted to play in a larger market, either Los Angeles or New York. After the front office was unable to convince him to stay, the Bucks obliged Abdul-Jabbar's request by trading him to the Lakers on June 16, 1975, for [[Elmore Smith]], [[Junior Bridgeman]], [[Brian Winters]], and [[David Meyers (basketball)|David Meyers]]. The trade triggered a series of events that led to a change in the team's ownership. Minority owner and cable television executive [[Jim Fitzgerald (businessman)|Jim Fitzgerald]] opposed the trade and wanted to sell his stock.\\n\\n===1976\\u20131979: Post-Abdul-Jabbar era; \\\"Green 'n Growing\\\"===\\nAfter the deal, the Bucks had several seasons in transition, but most of these players would go on to help the team. After being sold to Fitzgerald and several partners in 1976, the Bucks would enter into another era of greatness. It began with [[Don Nelson]] who became head coach in November 1976 after [[Larry Costello]] abruptly resigned. In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first-round picks and drafted [[Kent Benson]], [[Marques Johnson]] and [[Ernie Grunfeld]]. Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come. Rookie [[Sidney Moncrief]] made his debut in 1979. Don Nelson went on to win two [[NBA Coach of the Year]] awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985.\\n\\nOn October 18, 1977, Abdul-Jabbar, playing with the Lakers, punched Benson during a game. Abdul-Jabbar broke his hand in the process.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walton Injury Opens Door for Bullets|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19771978.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314045723/http://www.nba.com/history/season/19771978.html|archive-date=March 14, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Benson had been aggressive under the boards and Abdul-Jabbar, a [[martial arts]] [[blackbelt (martial arts)|blackbelt]], snapped. Abdul-Jabbar was fined $5,000 by the NBA and missed the next 20 games. Meanwhile, Benson never played as aggressively again and the Bucks traded him to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in 1980 for veteran center [[Bob Lanier]] to fill in the hole left by the departure of Abdul-Jabbar. They then won the [[Midwest Division (NBA)|Midwest Division]] title in 1980. After losing to Seattle in the semi-finals, the Bucks moved to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]'s [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]].\\n\\n===1979\\u20131990: The Sidney Moncrief era===\\nThere, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years. Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, [[Marques Johnson]], [[Paul Pressey]], [[Junior Bridgeman]] and the arrival of [[Craig Hodges]], [[Terry Cummings]], [[Ricky Pierce]] and [[Jack Sikma]] from trades with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[Seattle SuperSonics]] respectively. However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the [[Philadelphia 76ers|Sixers]] each time.\\n\\nFor much of the 1970s, the Bucks' colors were forest green, deep red and white. In 1978, they added various shades of green to the uniforms, and in 1985, they eliminated red from the team colors.\\n\\nNoteworthy for the 1980s Bucks is that in [[1983 NBA playoffs|1983]] they became the first, and until [[2003 NBA playoffs|2003]], only team in NBA history to sweep the [[Boston Celtics]] in a best-of-seven playoff series, being the first team to meet and defeat [[Michael Jordan]] in [[1985 NBA playoffs|a playoff series]] (during Jordan's rookie year), and hosting [[Julius Erving]]'s final NBA game in the [[1987 NBA playoffs]], which would see the Bucks advancing with a game five first-round playoff victory.\\n\\n====Ownership and arena changes====\\nIn 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks. Fitzgerald was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out, and he was reeling from the failure of [[Sportsvue]], a pioneering regional sports network\\u2013a failure that came in part because Milwaukee itself was not wired for cable. By then, Milwaukee Arena was the smallest arena in the NBA, and the city did not want to build a new one. Milwaukee businessman and future U.S. Senator [[Herb Kohl]] bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee. Before the transaction was complete, broadcaster [[Lloyd Pettit]] and his wife, [[Jane Bradley Pettit]], announced they were donating a new arena called the [[BMO Harris Bradley Center|Bradley Center]]. In 2003, after considering selling the team, Kohl announced that he had decided against selling the Bucks to [[Michael Jordan]] and would \\\"continue to own them, improve them and commit them to remaining in Wisconsin\\\".\\n\\nOn May 21, 2012, the [[naming rights]] of the Bradley Center were sold to [[BMO Harris Bank]], a division of [[Bank of Montreal]]. BMO Harris had merged with Milwaukee-based [[M&I Bank]] a year earlier. After the heirs to the Bradley fortune gave their approval, the arena was renamed the \\\"BMO Harris Bradley Center\\\".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Milwaukee's Bradley Center Becomes the BMO Harris Bradley Center As Local \\\"Champions of the Community\\\" Come Forward to Support Jane Bradley Pettit's Gift|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/milwaukees-bradley-center-becomes-bmo-harris-bradley-center-local-champions-community-come-f|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=May 21, 2012|access-date=October 3, 2015|archive-date=January 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107053702/http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/milwaukees-bradley-center-becomes-bmo-harris-bradley-center-local-champions-community-come-f|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n===1990\\u20131998: The period of struggles===\\nFor most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches [[Frank Hamblen]], [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.|Mike Dunleavy]], and [[Chris Ford]]. They would make the playoffs only three times during the 1990s, winning only one playoff game. From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered a franchise-record seven straight losing seasons. During this period, the Bucks drafted [[Glenn Robinson]] with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie [[Ray Allen]] in a draft-day trade with the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks' resurgence during the late 1990s. At the [[1998 NBA draft]], the Bucks made a trade that would come back to haunt them for years. At the draft, the Bucks selected [[Dirk Nowitzki]] with the ninth overall pick, but traded him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in exchange for [[Robert Traylor]]. Many rank this as one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, as Nowitzki would go onto a 21-season career with the Mavericks, winning a championship in [[2011 NBA Finals|2011]] while being named Finals MVP in the process, along with winning the NBA MVP award in 2007. Meanwhile, Traylor would spend just two seasons with the Bucks before joining the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].\\n\\nAfter the franchise's 25th anniversary in 1993, the Bucks overhauled their logo and uniforms. The colors were green, purple, and silver. The old logo, which featured a cartoonish deer, was replaced in favor of a more realistic one. The primary color scheme was altered as well, when red was supplanted by purple. Purple road uniforms replaced the former green away uniforms.\\n\\nIn 1997, the Bucks sent all-star forward [[Vin Baker]] in a three-team trade to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], and they would acquire [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] guard [[Terrell Brandon]] and forward [[Tyrone Hill]]. They also traded their 10th overall pick [[Danny Fortson]], guard [[Johnny Newman]], and center [[Joe Wolf]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]] for center [[Ervin Johnson]]. The 1997\\u201398 Bucks finished their season with a 36\\u201346 record, failing to make the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time.\\n\\n===1998\\u20132003: The Big Three era; \\\"Let It Fly\\\"===\\nAfter a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations. In 1998, the team hired veteran coach [[George Karl]], who had reached the [[NBA Finals]] with the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. Under the leadership of Karl and general manager [[Ernie Grunfeld]], and with the steady addition of talent such as [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] and [[Sam Cassell]], the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference. The nucleus of the \\\"big three\\\"\\u2014consisting of [[Ray Allen]], Cassell, and Robinson\\u2014along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee. The team reached its zenith in 2000\\u20132001, winning 52 games and their first division title in 15 years. The Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals by defeating the Charlotte Hornets. They lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games to the 76ers. This era became known for many Bucks fans as the \\\"Let It Fly\\\" era, due to the high-scoring offense of the team, personified by the shooting of Robinson and Allen.\\n\\nAfter coming within one game of an NBA Finals appearance in 2001, the Bucks sought to make key off-season player additions to put the team in the NBA Finals. Behind the strong encouragement of George Karl, the Bucks acquired forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]] at the beginning of the [[2001\\u201302 NBA season|2001\\u201302 season]]. On paper, this move made the Bucks the team to beat in the East. However, Mason battled with his weight and had a tough time finding his role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Markus|first=Don|title=Jury still out on Mason as plus/minus for Bucks|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-11-18/sports/0111180209_1_anthony-mason-milwaukee-bucks-karl|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=November 18, 2001|access-date=November 18, 2001|archive-date=April 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430002147/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-11-18/sports/0111180209_1_anthony-mason-milwaukee-bucks-karl|url-status=live}}</ref> The Bucks, who at the season's midway point were the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, went into a swoon in February and March. The collapse culminated with a loss to the [[Detroit Pistons]] on the final night of the season, which eliminated the Bucks from the playoffs and gave the division to the Pistons. The fallout created tension between Karl and the players, resulting in a trade of [[Glenn Robinson]] to Atlanta (for [[Toni Kuko\\u010d]] and a 2003 first-round draft pick, used to select [[T. J. Ford]]).\\n\\nDuring the [[2002\\u201303 NBA season|2002\\u201303 season]], the Bucks traded Ray Allen and backup Ronald \\\"Flip\\\" Murray to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] for [[Gary Payton]] and [[Desmond Mason]]. The trade allowed emerging star [[Michael Redd]] to see increased playing time, and with Payton in the backcourt, they finished the season with a 42\\u201340 record. The Bucks made the playoffs, but lost in the first round to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in six games. That offseason, team leaders [[Sam Cassell]] and Ervin Johnson were traded to Minnesota (for [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]]). Payton left via free agency, after playing only 28 games for the Bucks. Karl's tenure also ended after the season. Within a one-year period, the team had lost the coach and players most responsible for the team's success during that era.\\n[[File:Toni Kukoc.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Toni Kuko\\u010d]] playing for the Bucks.]]\\n\\n===2003\\u20132009: The Michael Redd era===\\n[[File:ReddBucks.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Michael Redd playing for the Bucks.]]\\nUnder the direction of new general manager [[Larry Harris (basketball)|Larry Harris]], the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years. During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach [[Terry Porter]] in [[2004 NBA playoffs|2004]] and then under [[Terry Stotts]] in [[2006 NBA playoffs|2006]]. In both instances, they were defeated by the [[Detroit Pistons]] in five games.

Bogut struggled with both inconsistency and injuries in his first four years in Milwaukee, but over time became a key contributor to the Bucks.\\n\\nIn 2006, the team finished 40\\u201342, last in their division, 24 games behind Detroit, but still made the playoffs in a season where every team in their division did. They were paired as the eighth seed versus the 64\\u201318 conference-leading Pistons. They won game three at home, but lost the other four in a 4\\u20131 series loss.\\n\\nAlso in March, the Bucks announced that they would not renew general manager [[Larry Harris (basketball)|Larry Harris]]'s contract, which was to expire in June. In April, the Bucks hired John Hammond, formerly vice-president of basketball operations for the Pistons, as their new general manager,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks name John Hammond General Manager|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/hammond_named_general_manager_080411.html?rss=true|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=April 11, 2008|access-date=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225045344/http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/hammond_named_general_manager_080411.html?rss=true|archive-date=December 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> giving the Milwaukee team a fresh director recently associated with success.\\n\\nAlso in April, the Bucks announced that [[Larry Krystkowiak]], the third and final head coach hired by Larry Harris, had been relieved of his duties.

The slogan became the team's battle cry in the NBA playoffs. The Bucks finished the regular season with a record of 46\\u201336. The Bucks clinched the sixth seed and were eliminated in a seven-game series against the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. It was the farthest Milwaukee had gotten in the post-season since [[2001 NBA playoffs|2001]]. The Bucks' short playoff run was also in part due to Bogut suffering a broken arm after making an awkward fall after a dunk in a late-season game, thus ending his season. In the 2010\\u201311 season, the Bucks finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, just out of reach of the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010-2011 DIVISION STANDINGS|url=http://www.nba.com/standings/2010/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Div.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|access-date=May 16, 2013|archive-date=May 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530092257/http://www.nba.com/standings/2010/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Div.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nWith Bogut sidelined for the rest of the season and [[Stephen Jackson]] and head coach [[Scott Skiles]] not seeing eye-to-eye, the Bucks decided to trade both players.

By the start of the 2013\\u201314 season, the Bucks only had four players on their roster from the previous season. The season itself was a struggle, as the Bucks finished with the worst record in the league at 15\\u201367, the worst record in team history.\\n\\nOn April 16, 2014, long-time Bucks owner Herb Kohl agreed to sell a majority interest of the team to New York-based billionaires [[Wes Edens]], and [[Marc Lasry]] for $550 million, but Kohl retained a significant minority interest in the team.

While Parker missed making the All-Star team, Giannis was voted in as a starter, becoming the first Bucks All-Star since Michael Redd in 2004. In January, the Bucks slumped, though fans anticipated a turnaround with Middleton's return on February 8 against the Miami Heat. In the same game, however, Parker tore his ACL for the second time in 3 seasons, ending his season. Even so, Middleton's return still sparked a turnaround in March. During the month, the Bucks went 14\\u20134, putting the team back in the thick of the playoff race.

The word \\\"Bango\\\" was originally coined by [[Eddie Doucette]], the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Bucks. Doucette used the word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket. It was often used for sharpshooter [[Jon McGlocklin]]. When it came time for the Bucks to choose a name for their new mascot, the name \\\"Bango\\\" won the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Adam |title=Milwaukee Bucks History: The Bango Origin Story |url=https://behindthebuckpass.com/2016/09/14/milwaukee-bucks-history-bango-origin-story/ |website=behindthebuckpass.com |access-date=October 29, 2018 |date=September 14, 2016 |archive-date=October 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030090903/https://behindthebuckpass.com/2016/09/14/milwaukee-bucks-history-bango-origin-story/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\nBango has been the Bucks' official mascot since October 18, 1977, which was Milwaukee's home opener of the [[1977\\u201378 NBA season|1977\\u201378 season]]. In addition to the date being Bango's home debut, the game itself pitted Milwaukee against former Bucks center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and his [[Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[Milwaukee Arena]]. Bango's original outfit only consisted of a green wool sweater with a \\\"B\\\" on the front, similar to the buck featured on the team logo. Since the 1990s, Bango now wears a Bucks uniform with the number 68, referring to the franchise's inaugural season of 1968. Bango has worked hard to become popular with Bucks fans throughout the state of Wisconsin over the years, appearing at schools, parades, and festivals as a goodwill ambassador for the team. His high-flying acrobatic layups, daring rebounds, and other entertaining antics still play an important role in energizing Bucks fans at the [[Fiserv Forum]]. Since 2001, Bango has also made perennial appearances at the [[NBA All-Star Game]].\\n\\nAt the 2009 All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, Bango suffered an injury during a mascot-participative skit. While standing on one basket's rim, Bango's right leg slipped through the hoop, and he fell on the rim. He then slipped further and fell through the basket entirely. Bango tore his ACL due to the fall and was unable to perform for the remainder of the 2008\\u201309 season, periodically making appearances at games in a wheelchair. A video of Bango's injury at the 2009 Mascot Challenge was uploaded onto [[YouTube]] shortly after the incident occurred.<ref name=\\\"bucky\\\">Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/f_VdySnHsJY Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090308100742/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_VdySnHsJY Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_VdySnHsJY|title=NBA mascot hits halfcourt shot off another mascot|via=YouTube|date=February 18, 2009|access-date=May 16, 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\\n\\nDuring game four of the 2009\\u201310 [[2010 NBA Playoffs#(3) Atlanta Hawks vs. (6) Milwaukee Bucks|first-round playoff series between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Atlanta Hawks]], Bango successfully performed a back-flip dunk from the top of a 16-foot ladder, a feat similar to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]' mascot [[Squatch]]'s feat during a March 19, 2008, game between the [[SuperSonics]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]].\\n\\nBango has also dunked the ball while in a human hamster wheel in 2012 and made a behind-the-back half-court shot in New Orleans at the NBA All-Star game.

The white uniform featured \\\"Bucks\\\" in green serifed letters with red trim and block numbers, while the green uniform has \\\"Milwaukee\\\" in white serifed letters with red trim. Both sets have the deer head logo on the left leg. The Bucks would bring back the green uniform in the [[2002\\u201303 NBA season|2002\\u201303 season]], and the white uniform in the [[2017\\u201318 NBA season|2017\\u201318 season]] as part of the league's \\\"Classic\\\" uniform series.\\n\\nPrior to the [[1971\\u201372 NBA season|1971\\u201372 season]], the letters on the white uniform changed to red with green trim, with \\\"Bucks\\\" now taking a block letter style. They kept the original green uniform until 1973, when it was modified to feature a script \\\"Milwaukee\\\" in red with white trim and numbers below the left chest. Both sets removed the deer head logo on the shorts.\\n\\nIn the [[1975\\u201376 NBA season|1975\\u201376 season]], the Bucks' white uniform changed to feature a script \\\"Bucks\\\" lettering and numbers on the left chest. The green uniform brought back the block \\\"Milwaukee\\\" lettering and centered numbers but kept the red base and white trim. The striping on the shorts was also modified.\\n\\n===1977\\u20131993===\\nCoinciding with the debut of [[Robert Indiana]]'s iconic [[UW\\u2013Milwaukee Panther Arena|MECCA]] court in the [[1977\\u201378 NBA season|1977\\u201378 season]], the Bucks redesigned their uniforms. It now featured side stripes of kelly, lime and hunter green (a.k.a. the \\\"Irish Rainbows\\\"). Both the hunter green and white uniforms featured the streamlined \\\"Bucks\\\" lettering from the team logo and block lettering. They removed the color red prior to the [[1985\\u201386 NBA season|1985\\u201386 season]], while lime green was promoted to accent color.\\n\\n===1993\\u20132006===\\nThe Bucks changed their logo and uniforms for the [[1993\\u201394 NBA season|1993\\u201394 season]]. Green was relegated to trim color in favor of purple, while silver was added as an accent color. The original white uniform featured the letters in green with silver and purple trim, while the purple uniform featured letters in white with green and silver trim. In the [[2001\\u201302 NBA season|2001\\u201302 season]], the uniforms were tweaked to include the alternate antler logo on the waist along with extended side stripes. Letters on the purple uniform were now silver with green and white trim. The purple uniform from this era would be reused in the [[2022\\u201323 NBA season|2022\\u201323 season]] as part of the \\\"Classic\\\" edition series.\\n\\n{| align=right\\n|{{Basketball kit\\n| align = right\\n| pattern_b = _milwaukeebucks90s_road\\n| pattern_s = _milwaukeebucks90s_road\\n| body = ffffff\\n| shorts = ffffff\\n| title = 1995\\u201399 Uniform\\n}}\\n|}\\n\\nIn the [[1995\\u201396 NBA season|1995\\u201396 season]] the Bucks unveiled a hunter green alternate uniform. The script \\\"Bucks\\\" lettering was in white fading to silver and purple and numbers were in white with green and purple trim. The uniform featured the graphic [[deer]] logo on the right side. They were retired after the [[1998\\u201399 NBA season|1998\\u201399 season]]. It would be resurrected for the [[2012\\u201313 NBA season|2012\\u201313 season]] during Hardwood Classics Nights, to updated uniform standards.\\n\\nAccording to former NBA creative director Tom O'Grady, the Bucks' purple and green color scheme was inspired by a mysterious [[FedEx]] package that O'Grady received in 1992, containing a dark green cap and purple shirt with the logo of the [[Wimbledon Championships]], and a handwritten letter by then-Bucks general manager [[Mike Dunleavy Sr.]]\\n\\n===2006\\u20132015===\\n[[File:BucksWordmark.png|right|thumb|150px|Milwaukee Bucks wordmark, 2006\\u20132015.]]\\nThe uniforms were changed again for the [[2006\\u201307 NBA season|2006\\u201307 season]]. The new home uniform was white with [[hunter green]] stripes on the sides. Inside each green stripe is a thinner red stripe that splits into two stripes near the shoulders. The numbers are green with a red outline. Milwaukee had two road uniforms as part of this set. The primary one was hunter green and a similar design to the home uniform with white numbers with a silver highlight and red outline. Both uniforms jerseys said \\\"BUCKS\\\" across the chest in beveled block letters, the 'B' and 'S' slightly larger than the rest of the letters. A secondary road uniform was introduced in the [[2008\\u201309 NBA season|2008\\u201309 season]]. Consisting of red jersey and shorts, it was made to resemble the 1968\\u201373 uniforms. It says \\\"Milwaukee\\\" in white and silver writing, along with the numbers. The uniform set was tweaked for the [[2014\\u201315 NBA season|2014\\u201315 season]], with the addition of a gold tab commemorating their 1971 championship and the move of the NBA logo to the back. The 'Bucks' lettering was tweaked to make all the letters the same height.\\n\\nDuring the 2014\\u201315 season, hints were made by the Bucks that their logo and uniforms were going to be redesigned. For one home game, it was anticipated that new uniforms were going to be revealed with [[Safety orange|hunter orange]] replacing red as the secondary color. It turned out to be an April Fool's joke, though the Bucks did announce that a new logo and colors would be revealed on April 13, 2015.<ref name=\\\"BucksIdentity\\\" />\\n\\n===2015\\u2013present===\\nOn April 13, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled new primary and secondary logos, as well as a new color scheme. The new branding will take effect beginning with the 2015\\u201316 NBA season. The Bucks' new official colors are Good Land green (a reference to \\\"Milwaukee\\\" being supposedly based on an Algonquian word meaning \\\"The Good Land\\\"), Cream City cream (based on Milwaukee's old nickname of \\\"the [[Cream City brick|Cream City]]\\\", which came from the cream-colored bricks that were used for constructing many of Milwaukee's buildings back during the late 19th century), Great Lakes blue, black, and white.<ref name=\\\"BucksIdentity\\\" />\\n\\n[[File:Milwaukee Bucks wordmark 2015-current.png|right|thumb|150px|Milwaukee Bucks wordmark, 2015\\u2013present.]]\\n\\nOn June 6, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled their new home and road uniforms, to be worn beginning with the [[2015\\u201316 NBA season|2015\\u201316 season]]. The new uniforms remained white at home and green on the road, but red is now replaced by cream. The 'Milwaukee' city name also returned to the road uniforms for the first time since 1976. In addition, the jerseys feature a unique color block pattern on the sides, titled the \\\"Cream City Rainbow\\\". The pattern consists of the team's new colors of green, cream, royal blue and black, which the Bucks described as an homage to the \\\"Irish Rainbow\\\" design of the 1980s. Blue was also included inside the collar, representing Milwaukee and Wisconsin's \\\"blue collar\\\" citizens, while the inscription \\\"Fear the Deer\\\" was written on the bottom left upside down. The back collar features a small gold tab above the NBA logo, commemorating the Bucks' [[1971 NBA Finals|1971]] and [[2021 NBA Finals|2021]] NBA championships.<ref>{{cite press release|title=BUCKS UNVEIL NEW HOME AND ROAD UNIFORMS|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-unveil-new-home-and-road-uniforms|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=June 6, 2015|access-date=October 4, 2015|archive-date=October 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021232946/http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-unveil-new-home-and-road-uniforms|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/uniforms|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=June 6, 2015|access-date=October 4, 2015|archive-date=October 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001113457/http://www.nba.com/bucks/Uniforms|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nOn October 3, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled a new black alternate uniform. The uniforms still feature the trim and the \\\"Cream City Rainbow\\\" on the sides, with the new Bucks logo in the center and the uniform number placed between the antlers of the logo. In conjunction with the unveiling of the uniform, dubbed the \\\"Fear the Deer uniform\\\", the team also unveiled a new alternate court design, a first in NBA history. The team planned to wear the black alternate uniform and play on the alternate court design for at least four home games during the [[2015\\u201316 NBA season|2015\\u201316 season]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Bucks Announce 'Fear the Deer' Nights Featuring Alternate Uniforms and an Alternate Court|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-announce-fear-deer-nights-featuring-alternate-uniforms-and-alternate-court|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=October 3, 2015|access-date=October 5, 2015|archive-date=October 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005015845/http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-announce-fear-deer-nights-featuring-alternate-uniforms-and-alternate-court|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's new protocol for uniforms, with each team allotted 5 different uniform sets, the Bucks added to their regular home (now \\\"Association\\\" white) and road (now \\\"Icon\\\" green) uniforms, as well as their alternate black (\\\"Statement\\\") uniforms. For their retro uniform, the Bucks went with a replica version of their inaugural home uniforms from 1968 to 1970, as part of the Bucks celebrating their 50th season in the NBA. In addition, the Bucks were also given new \\\"City\\\" uniforms, conceived by Nike as a way of commemorating each of the NBA teams' city history and pride. The \\\"City\\\" uniforms, dubbed \\\"Cream City\\\" uniforms, featured cream-colored jerseys and shorts, with the \\\"Cream City Rainbow\\\" running horizontally along the front of the uniform, with the Bucks logo in the middle. The \\\"Cream City Rainbow\\\" was also on the shorts, shaped in an \\\"M\\\" on both sides that are part of the regular Bucks' uniform design.\\n\\nFor the 2018\\u201319 season, Milwaukee's \\\"City\\\" uniform will pay homage to Robert Indiana's famous MECCA court, featuring yellow, beige and red as base colors and light blue and forest green on the hem of the shorts. \\\"Bucks\\\" is written vertically on the right while the number is on the left; both are in forest green with lime green trim. The Bucks would also wear an \\\"Earned\\\" uniform by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs; this uniform is essentially the \\\"City\\\" uniform but with the visual elements of red with green stripes, inspired from the 1977\\u20131985 \\\"Irish Rainbow\\\" home uniform.\\n\\nThe Bucks made slight updates to the black \\\"Statement\\\" uniform prior to the 2019\\u201320 season. It was essentially a black version of the team's 2017\\u201318 \\\"City\\\" uniform, with the exception of the \\\"Fear the Deer\\\" insignia on the beltline and near the jock tag.\\n\\nThe Bucks' 2019\\u201320 \\\"City\\\" uniform again used a cream base, this time with a stylized \\\"Cream City\\\" wordmark in front. Blue, cream and green stripes run through the piping while a giant \\\"M\\\" insignia is featured on the shorts. These uniforms are a nod to the team\\u2019s fondness of the cream-colored brick buildings which surround the city of Milwaukee.\\n\\nThe 2020\\u201321 Bucks \\\"City\\\" uniform used three shades of Great Lakes Blue as its base color. The uniform was a nod to Milwaukee's meaning as \\\"the gathering place by the water\\\" due to the city's location at the confluence of the [[Milwaukee River|Milwaukee]], [[Menomonee River|Menomonee]] and [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River tributary)|Kinnickinnic]] rivers flowing into [[Lake Michigan]].\\n\\nAs in 2019, the Bucks were given an \\\"Earned\\\" uniform after making the [[2020 NBA playoffs|2020 playoffs]]. This design, with a predominantly green base, featured \\\"Bucks,\\\" the uniform number and piping in white with black trim, and stylized antlers on each side.\\n\\nThe 2021\\u201322 Bucks \\\"City\\\" uniform combined different elements of each of the Bucks' different uniform designs during their history, as part of the NBA's 75th season celebration. The jersey is white, with arched block letters, similar to their first uniforms. The sides featured the different shades of green from the team's \\\"Irish Rainbow\\\" uniform, as well as one line of blue from their current \\\"Cream City Rainbow\\\". Down the rest of the side of the jersey is purple, from the team's uniforms of the late 1990s, early 2000s.\\n\\nStarting with the 2022\\u201323 season, the green \\\"Earned\\\" uniform worn in 2021 became the basis of the team's new black \\\"Statement\\\" uniform. Also during the season, the Bucks' \\\"City\\\" uniform paid homage to the Bronzeville neighborhood, featuring a blue base, cream trim and rainbow side stripes of black, blue, cream and green. The team chose replicas of their 2000\\u201301 purple road uniforms for their \\\"Classic\\\" uniform.\\n\\nFor the 2023\\u201324 \\\"City\\\" uniform, the Bucks wore a blue-based uniform with cream and green accents; the cream curving stripes surrounding the blue \\\"Milwaukee\\\" wordmark were meant to represent the Fiserv Forum architecture. The design was inspired by the fans that flood the neighborhood in Deer District, and were represented by light blue speckles.\\n\\n==Season-by-season record==\\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Bucks.

In 2018 the Bucks agreed to a seven-year extension with the network.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report: Milwaukee Bucks ink US$200m Fox Sports deal|url=https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/report-milwaukee-bucks-ink-us200m-fox-sports-wisconsin-deal|last=Carp|first=Sam|date=June 7, 2018|access-date=January 29, 2019|archive-date=October 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016040924/http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/report-milwaukee-bucks-ink-us200m-fox-sports-wisconsin-deal|url-status=live}}</ref> Selected games also air on the BS Wisconsin Plus feed, in case of [[Milwaukee Brewers]] conflicts. Bucks games produced by Bally Sports are also carried on the [[Bally Sports app]] within the team's broadcast territory.\\n\\nPrior to the Bally Sports Wisconsin exclusivity, the Bucks split their television broadcasts between Fox Sports Wisconsin (which through various incarnations have televised Bucks games since 1996) and [[WVTV-DT2|WCGV]] (Channel 24) from 1999 to 2007, and prior that, [[WVTV]] (Channel 18) was the over-the-air partner from 1994 to 1999. WCGV also previously carried Bucks games from 1988 to 1994, and WVTV again, this time from 1976 to 1988; these two stations are currently owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], who also own [[Bally Sports]]. During each station's tenures as the over-the-air TV home of the Bucks, the telecasts consisted of almost exclusively road games; very few Bucks home games on either station were televised through the years, as the Bucks were one of the last NBA teams to televise home games regularly. The Bucks, along with their respective TV partners, co-produced and distributed the over-the-air telecasts to stations throughout Wisconsin.\\n\\nIn the franchise's early years, Bucks games were carried on then-[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WITI-TV|WITI]] (Channel 6), from 1968 to 1971, and on then-[[CBS]] affiliate [[WISN-TV]] (Channel 12) from 1971 to 1976; both respective runs also coincided with NBA coverage already carried by their networks at the time: [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] (1965\\u20131973) and [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] (1973\\u20131990). The two stations swapped networks in March 1977, with WISN since remaining with ABC, and WITI switching from CBS to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in December 1994.\\n\\nUntil his 2021 retirement, [[Jim Paschke]] was the team's television play-by-play announcer since 1986, with former Buck [[Jon McGlocklin]] providing [[color commentary]] for the team from 1976 to 2018. From 2015 to 2018, veteran announcer [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] called selected games alongside Paschke on a rotating basis. During that time, former Buck [[Marques Johnson]] also was in the booth for selected games, but became the new permanent color commentator for the 2018\\u201319 season when the team moved to the [[Fiserv Forum]]. Veteran sportscaster [[Eddie Doucette]] served as the team's original play-by-play voice, working in that capacity from 1968 to 1984; he also called selected Bucks games on WITI, WISN-TV, and during most of WVTV's first tenure with the Bucks. He and McGlocklin also co-founded the [[MACC Fund|Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer (MACC) Fund]] in 1976, which raises money to help cancer research. In 2021, the team named [[Lisa Byington]] as their new television play-by-play announcer, making her the first woman to be the lead TV play-by-play announcer for a team in any of the four men's professional leagues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milwaukee Bucks Name Lisa Byington as Television Play-By-Play Announcer|url=https://www.nba.com/bucks/news/milwaukee-bucks-name-lisa-byington-television-play-play-announcer|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=September 15, 2021|access-date=September 15, 2021|archive-date=September 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210915204032/https://www.nba.com/bucks/news/milwaukee-bucks-name-lisa-byington-television-play-play-announcer|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nOn the radio side the team has been carried by [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] (620/103.3) and throughout the state on the [[Milwaukee Bucks Radio Network]] (which is sponsored by BMO Harris) for most of the team's history.

The grand dukes allowed the creation of a Jewish commune in 1389, and the city received its charter in 1441. Grodno was the site of two battles during the [[Great Northern War]].\\n\\nGrodno has a rich history with various rulers and influences. In 1793, Grodno became the capital of the Grodno Voivodeship, but was annexed by Russia in 1795 after [[Third Partition of Poland]]. The city had a significant Jewish population before the Holocaust. After WWI, it was briefly part of the Belarusian People's Republic and the Republic of Lithuania before being taken over by Poland. During WWII, it was occupied by the Soviet Union and later by Nazi Germany. Since 1945, Grodno has been part of Belarus. Today, it has a diverse population, including Belarusians, Poles, and a small Jewish community.

Batory died at this palace seven years later (December 1586) and originally was interred in Grodno. (His [[autopsy]] there was the first to take place in [[Eastern Europe]].) After his death, the castle was altered on numerous occasions, although a 17th-century stone arch bridge linking it with the city still survives.

The area was made a ward in the church in 1889 with Arthur M. Rawson as [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]], who renamed the town in honor of [[Ammon (Book of Mormon)|Ammon]], a figure in the LDS book of scripture, the [[Book of Mormon]]. Since it was now independent of the Iona Ward, a new name seemed appropriate. On February 9, 1893, the name of the town was changed from South Iona Ward to Ammon.<ref>{{cite book\\n| last      = Jenson\\n| first     = Andrew\\n| title     = Church chronology: a record of important events pertaining to the history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\n| publisher = BiblioBazaar\\n| isbn      = 1-115-24708-5\\n| year      = 2009\\n| page      = 201\\n}}</ref>\\n\\nBy 1930 the village of Ammon had 270 inhabitants, but the total district of Ammon, which is how the name is usually used and is closer to the modern borders, had a population of about 1100.<ref>Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 22</ref>\\n\\nAmmon was an early agricultural center and later was home to several general stores, a grain elevator and a brickyard. The city was officially incorporated on October 10, 1905. It became a Second Class City under Idaho law in 1963.

The film, which was not authorized by [[DC Comics|DC]], is thought to be [[lost film|lost]].\\n\\n==Plot==\\nThe story concerned the [[mad scientist]] named Dr. Zorba who, after repeatedly being defeated by [[Batman]], finds a way to resurrect the wicked [[Count Dracula]], control him, and even make him stronger, rendering him invincible towards traditional ways of killing him, such as [[Crucifix|Christian crosses]].\\n\\nDracula sneaks into the Batcave, and attacks Batman. Batman attempts to use holy water and a cross to injure the vampire, but due to Zorba's machinations, they have no effect. Dracula throws Batman against a wall and then flees, leaving Batman knocked out. When the unconscious Batman is found by his butler, Turko (a character based on Alfred Pennyworth), he tends to the crime fighter's wounds and then calls for Batman's girlfriend and sidekick to aid in tracking down his attacker.\\n\\nAfter tracking down Zorba at his underground fortress, Ruben (a character based on the existing sidekick [[Robin (character)|Robin]]) and the beautiful Marita manage to kill the evil doctor by turning the vampire against him.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/movies-and-tv/batman-fights-dracula-lost-film-a00289-20201027|title = Lost Cinema: Batman Once Fought Dracula in This Classic Filipino Film| newspaper=Esquiremag.ph }}</ref> The vampire then is investigated by a recovering Batman within a cage in the Batcave, and the film ends with Batman lecturing Dracula about justice.\\n\\n==Credited cast==\\n*[[Jing Abalos]] as [[Batman]]/Bruce Mabuto\\n*[[Ramon d'Salva]] as Dr. Zorba\\n*Vivian Lorrain as Marita Banzon\\n*Nort Nepomuceno as Alan \\\"Turko\\\" Turkentop\\n*[[Dante Rivero]] as [[Dracula]]\\n*Rolan Robles as Ruben\\n\\n==See also==\\n* ''[[Alyas Batman at Robin]]''\\n* ''[[James Batman]]''\\n* ''[[Batman & Dracula trilogy]]''\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*{{IMDb title|0061386}}\\n* {{Amg movie|139382}}\\n\\n{{Batman fan films}}\\n{{Dracula}}\\n\\n[[Category:1967 films]]\\n[[Category:1967 independent films]]\\n[[Category:1960s superhero films]]\\n[[Category:Lost Philippine films]]\\n[[Category:Unofficial Batman films]]\\n[[Category:Dracula films]]\\n[[Category:1960s lost films]]\\n[[Category:Mad scientist films]]\\n[[Category:Resurrection in film]]\\n[[Category:1960s American films]]\\n\\n\\n{{Philippines-film-stub}}\\n{{comics-film-stub}}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"quality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Stub\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He is best known for his [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] roles, especially [[King Lear]]. He often appeared in film, rising from a [[bit part]] actor to leading roles; by the time of his death he had appeared in nearly 140 films. His later work was predominantly in television and radio.\\n\\nBorn in [[Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire]], into a family with no theatrical connections, Hordern was educated at [[Windlesham House School]] in [[Pulborough]], [[West Sussex]]. He went on to [[Brighton College]], where his interest in the theatre developed. After leaving the college he joined an [[amateur dramatics]] company, and came to the notice of several influential Shakespearean directors who cast him in minor roles in ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]''. During the Second World War he served on [[HMS Illustrious (87)|HMS ''Illustrious'']], reaching the rank of [[Lieutenant commander (Royal Navy)|lieutenant commander]]. Upon [[demobilisation]] he resumed his acting career and made his television debut, becoming a bit-part actor in many films, particularly in the [[war film]] genre.\\n\\nHordern came to prominence in the early 1950s when he took part in a theatrical competition at the [[Arts Theatre]] in London. This led to a season-long contract at the [[Royal Shakespeare Theatre|Shakespeare Memorial Theatre]], where he played major parts including [[Caliban]] in ''[[The Tempest]]'', [[Jaques (As You Like It)|Jaques]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'', and Sir Politick Would-Be in [[Ben Jonson|Ben Jonson's]] comedy ''[[Volpone]]''. The following season Hordern joined [[Michael Benthall|Michael Benthall's]] company at [[the Old Vic]] where, among other parts, he played [[Polonius]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'', and [[John, King of England|the title role]] in ''[[King John (play)|King John]]''. In 1957 he won the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actor]] for his role as the barrister in [[John Mortimer|John Mortimer's]] courtroom drama ''[[The Dock Brief]]''. Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular supporting roles in various films including ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963), and ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1966).\\n\\nIn the late 1960s Hordern met the British theatre director [[Jonathan Miller]], who cast him in \\\"[[Whistle and I'll Come to You]]\\\", which was recorded for television and received wide praise. Hordern's next major play was ''[[Jumpers (play)|Jumpers]]'' at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in 1972. His performance was praised by critics and he reprised the role four years later. Hordern's television credits towards the end of his life included ''[[Paradise Postponed]]'', the [[BAFTA]] award-winning ''[[Memento Mori (novel)|Memento Mori]]'', and the [[BBC]] adaptation of ''[[Middlemarch (1994 TV serial)|Middlemarch]]''. He was appointed a [[CBE]] in 1972 and was [[knight bachelor|knighted]] eleven years later. Hordern suffered from kidney disease during the 1990s and died from it in 1995 aged 83.\\n\\n==Life and career==\\n\\n===Early life and education===\\n[[File:The Poplars Berkhamsted.jpg|thumb|The Poplars, Hordern's birthplace in [[Berkhamsted]], Hertfordshire]]\\n\\nHordern was born 3 October 1911 at [[Berkhamsted]], Hertfordshire, third son of Edward Joseph Calveley Hordern, of a family of Hampshire landed gentry with a strong clerical tradition, and Margaret Emily, daughter of mechanical engineer Edward Francis Murray.<ref>Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 17th edition, ed.

He was allowed two minutes to study each page of the script, but because of the frequent mistakes and many stalled lines, rehearsals became long and laborious.

The arrangement was convenient for the young actor, who used the premises as a base while he appeared in shows with the Rapier Players. One such piece was an adaption of [[Stella Gibbons]]'s ''[[Cold Comfort Farm]]'', which starred [[Mabel Constanduros]], who had adapted the book with Gibbons's permission.

The production took place at the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre]] in [[Cambridge]] and excited audiences because of its 25-year absence from the English stage. The writer [[T. C. Worsley]] was impressed by Hordern's performance and wrote: \\\"Perhaps an actor with star quality might have imposed on us more successfully than Mr Michael Hordern, and won our sympathy for Ivanov by his own personality. But such a performance would have raised the level of expectation all round. As it is, Mr Hordern is rich in intelligence, sensitivity and grasp, and with very few exceptions, the company give his impressive playing the right kind of support.\\\"<ref>T. C. Worsley; quoted in Hordern, pp. 88\\u201389.</ref> The title character in ''[[Macbeth]]'', directed by [[Alec Clunes]], was Hordern's next engagement.

Several other amateur directors also competed for the prize, which was to have their play funded and professionally displayed at the Arts.

Because of this, schedules had to be changed at the last minute, causing scenes to be brought forward. Such was the rush, script changes had to be written on scrap paper which would then often go missing. Because of the quick changes, scenes were often filmed the next day which left little time for performers to learn the revised scripts. Hordern likened the manic experience to being back in repertory theatre as he felt that that too was often unorganised and required the cast to frequently improvise. Filming took so long on ''Cleopatra'' that the boy employed to play Caesar's son had grown too tall during production and had to be replaced for [[Continuity editing|continuity]] reasons.<ref name=\\\"HORDERN115-116\\\" />|group= n}} Much to Hordern's annoyance, the film would require him to work once again with Rex Harrison, who was cast as [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]. Despite the animosity between them, they agreed to endure each other's company for the sake of the film. The agreement was short-lived; Harrison made a drunken quip at a cast dinner about ''Nina'' which prompted Hordern to assault him. The incident almost resulted in Hordern's dismissal, but the matter was quickly resolved by producers and the two were kept separate in between filming.

Despite this, rehearsals went ahead, which the cast found difficult; the play featured many scenes, a complicated script, and relied heavily on the opening scene, a sceptical speech about the existence of God which lasted 13 minutes. In his autobiography, Hordern commented: \\\"Each day my fists would sink into my cardigan pockets as I tried to make sense of it all.\\\"<ref name=\\\"HORDERN134\\\">Hordern, p. 134.</ref> In a meeting shortly before the opening night, Olivier complained to Stoppard that the play was overlong and, in some parts, laborious. Stoppard agreed to reduce the epilogue by half. The decision angered Hordern as it meant the extra stress of learning a new script at short notice. He vented his frustrations on Wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of the other scenes.<ref name=\\\"HORDERN134\\\" /> The final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when the [[revolving stage]] broke down and had to be fixed half-way through.

Hordern and Eve soon reconciled, but it was a time which he was keen to forget, including the play. Critics were complimentary of his performance, with one writing: \\\"''Stripwell'''s ambiguities are therefore viewed half affectionately and half contemptuously and this comes over well in Michael Hordern's portrayal of bumbling, sometimes endearing ineffectiveness, as skilful and accomplished a performance as one would expect from this actor.\\\"<ref name=\\\"HORDERN143\\\" />\\n\\nLater, in 1975, Hordern narrated ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'', [[Stanley Kubrick|Stanley Kubrick's]] filmed adaptation of [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s novel ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120711213838/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6bc285f7 \\\"Barry Lyndon (1975)\\\"], [[British Film Institute]], accessed 26 January 2016.</ref> The critic John Riley, writing for the British Film Institute, thought that the actor provided \\\"a witty and ironic foil to the characters' helplessness\\\".<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/498104/ \\\"Barry Lyndon (1975)\\\"], by John Riley.

Hordern was the oldest member of the company and found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors.<ref>Hordern, p. 144.</ref> Writing in his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote: \\\"Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour.

Stafford, 7th Baron Stafford''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100|KG}} (15 August 1402&nbsp;\\u2013 10 July 1460) of [[Stafford Castle]] in [[Staffordshire]], was an English nobleman and a military commander in the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Through his mother he had [[royal descent]] from [[King Edward III]], his great-grandfather, and from his [[Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford|father]], he inherited, at an early age, the [[earldom of Stafford]]. By his marriage to a daughter of [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland|Ralph, Earl of Westmorland]], Humphrey was related to the powerful [[Neville family]] and to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] in 1420 and following Henry V's death two years later he became a councillor for the new king, the nine-month-old [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], vied with [[Cardinal Beaufort]] for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447.\\n\\nStafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and for his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to [[Duke of Buckingham]]. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate\\u2014as her [[dower]]\\u2014had previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers and for some time he feuded violently with [[Sir Thomas Malory]] in the [[Midlands]].\\n\\nAfter returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator during [[Jack Cade's Rebellion]] of 1450, helping to suppress it. When the King's cousin, [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York's followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further and when civil war began in 1455, Stafford fought for the King in the [[First Battle of St Albans]] which began the Wars of the Roses. Both were captured by the [[House of York|Yorkists]] and Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] factions, the latter by now headed by Henry's wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]]. Partly due to a feud with a leading Yorkist\\u2014[[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]]\\u2014Stafford eventually declared for King Henry and the Duke of York was defeated in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Northampton]]. Acting as the King's personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford's eldest son had died of [[Plague (disease)|plague]] two years earlier and the Buckingham dukedom descended to Stafford's five-year-old grandson, [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Henry]], a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the King until he [[came of age]] in 1473.\\n\\n== Background and youth ==\\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Sir Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, KG.png|thumb|Arms of Sir Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, KG|alt=Colour diagram of Stafford's coat of arms]]\\nHumphrey Stafford was born in [[Stafford]] sometime on August 15, 1402.{{Sfn|Rawcliffe|2008}} He was the only son of [[Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford]], and [[Anne of Gloucester]], who was the daughter of Edward III's youngest son [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock]].{{Sfn|Rawcliffe|2008}} This gave Humphrey [[royal descent]], and made him a second cousin to the then king, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].{{Sfn|Griffiths |1979|p=20}}\\n\\nOn 21 July 1403, when Humphrey was less than a year old, his father was killed fighting for Henry IV against the rebel [[Henry Hotspur]] at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]].{{Sfn|Rawcliffe|2008}} Humphrey became 6th [[Earl of Stafford]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=389}} With the earldom came a large estate with land in more than a dozen counties.
