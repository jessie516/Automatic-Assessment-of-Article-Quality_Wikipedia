The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought on a [[Promontory of Quebec|plateau]] by the British Army and Royal Navy against the French Army, just outside the [[Ramparts of Quebec City|walls of Quebec City]] on land that was originally owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops in total, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between [[France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] over the fate of [[New France]], influencing the later creation of [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishbattles.com/battle-of-quebec.htm |title=Battle of Quebec |year=2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218174313/http://www.britishbattles.com/battle-of-quebec.htm |archive-date=18 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}</ref>\\n\\nThe culmination of a three-month [[siege]] by the British, the battle lasted about an hour. British troops commanded by General [[James Wolfe]] successfully resisted the [[Column (formation)|column]] advance of French troops and [[Canada (New France)|Canadian]] militia under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm]], employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts. Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle; Wolfe died of gunshot wounds just as the French began to retreat and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a [[musket ball]] wound just below his ribs. In the wake of the battle, the French evacuated the city.\\n\\nThe French forces would attempt to recapture Quebec the following spring, and in the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]], they forced the British to retreat within the walls. However, the French [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|failed to take the city]] and in 1763, following defeat in the [[Montreal campaign]], France [[Cession|ceded]] most of its possessions in eastern North America to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].\\n\\nThe decisive success of the British forces on the Plains of Abraham and the subsequent capture of Quebec became part of what was known in Great Britain as the \\\"[[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|Annus Mirabilis]]\\\" of 1759.\\n\\n==Overview==\\n[[Image:General-james-wolfe.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Wolfe printed ''circa'' 1776]]\\n\\nAs the [[Seven Years' War]] entered its later stages through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attack from British armies. In 1758 after their defeat in July at the [[Battle of Carillon]], the British took [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Louisbourg]] in August, causing Atlantic Canada to fall into their hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. The British also captured [[Fort Frontenac]] in the same month, costing the French supplies for the [[Ohio Valley]] campaign. When some of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] supporters of the French made peace with the British, France was forced to draw its troops back. The French leaders, specifically Governor [[Pierre Fran\\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal|de Vaudreuil]] and General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|Montcalm]], were unsettled by the British successes. However, Quebec was still able to protect itself as the British prepared a three-pronged attack for 1759.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|pp=178\\u2013179}}.</ref>\\n\\n[[James Wolfe]] expected to lead 12,000 men, but was greeted by only approximately 7,000 regular troops, 400 [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], and 300 gunners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=25}}.</ref> He was supported by a fleet of 49 ships and 140 smaller craft led by Admiral [[Charles Saunders (admiral)|Charles Saunders]].\\n\\n[[File: The Defeat of the French Fireships attacking the British Fleet at Anchor before Quebec.jpg|thumbnail|French [[fire ships]] sent downriver to block the British advance, as shown in a copy of a painting by [[Dominic Serres]]]]\\nIn preparation for the fleet's approach to Quebec, [[James Cook]] surveyed a large portion of the river, including a dangerous channel known as The Traverse. Cook's ship was one of the first ships up the river, sounding the channel and guiding the fleet as it moved up; Wolfe and his men landed on the [[\\u00cele d'Orl\\u00e9ans]] on 28 June.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hayes|2002|p=106}}.</ref> The French attempted to attack the fleet by sending seven [[fire ships]] downriver to disrupt the landing, but the ships were set afire too early and British sailors in longboats were able to pull the flaming craft clear of the fleet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1972|p=199}}.</ref>\\nThe following day, Wolfe's troops landed on the south bank of the river at [[L\\u00e9vis, Quebec|Point Levis]], nearly directly across the river from Quebec; an [[artillery]] battery was established there in early July that nearly levelled the lower town by [[bombardment]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|p=69}}.</ref>\\n\\nDespite an air of [[defeatism]] among the leadership,<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 197\\\">{{Harvnb|Eccles|1972|p=197}}.</ref> the French troops and New French militia defenders focused their preparations for British attacks on the [[Beauport Shore]].

In addition, a screen of trees along the Montmorency River made an approach on that route dangerous.<ref>{{Harvnb|Casgrain|1905|p=109}}.</ref> On 31 July, the first serious attempt by Wolfe's troops to land on the northern shore led to the [[Battle of Beauport]], also known as the Battle of Montmorency. Approximately 3,500 troops, supported by a heavy bombardment, attempted to land but were fired upon in the river shallows. Members of the [[Louisbourg Grenadiers]], who reached the beach, attempted a generally undisciplined charge on the French positions, but came under heavy fire; a thunderstorm ended the fight and allowed Wolfe to pull his troops back after taking some 450 casualties to Montcalm's 60.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|pp=35\\u201342}}.</ref>\\n\\nSome French officers felt the Montmorency defeat would be the last British attack; Vaudreuil wrote afterwards that \\\"I have no more anxiety about Quebec. Wolfe, I assure you, will make no progress... He contented himself with losing about five hundred of his best soldiers.\\\" He predicted another attack would come within days.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=98}}.</ref> Others in the French camp felt the campaign was over.<ref name=\\\"Lloyd 1959 103\\\">{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1959|p=103}}.</ref>\\n\\nFor the remainder of the summer, Wolfe's focus changed, possibly due to frustration with Montcalm's tactics. Wolfe's troops, along with [[United States Army Rangers#Early Rangers|American Rangers]], attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the St. Lawrence. An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm's army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=180}}.</ref> However, the attacks did reduce the number of suppliers available to the French, especially as the British navy, unable to control the St. Lawrence entirely, was successful in blockading the ports in France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=44}}.</ref>\\n\\n==Preparations==\\n[[Image:plains2009.jpg|thumb|left|The Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]\\nThrough the summer siege, illness spread through the British camps. In August, Wolfe himself was bedridden, causing already low morale to slump even further among the British troops.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|pp=104\\u2013107}}.</ref> With many men in camp hospitals, British fighting numbers were thinned, and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed by the end of September, or Britain's opportunity would be lost.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=201}}.</ref> In addition, his frustration with Montcalm's defensive stance continued to grow. In a letter to his mother, Wolfe wrote, \\\"The Marquis of Montcalm is at the head of a great number of bad soldiers, and I am at the head of a small number of good ones that wish for nothing so much as to fight him; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behaviour of his army.\\\" Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege, relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted, and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Casgrain|1905|p=157}}.</ref>\\n\\nAfter considering and rejecting a number of plans for landings on the north shore, a decision was made in late August by Wolfe and his brigadiers to land upriver of the city. If successful, such a landing would force Montcalm to fight, as a British force on the north shore of the St. Lawrence would cut his supply lines to Montreal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=181}}.</ref> Initial suggestions for landing sites ranged as far as {{cvt|32|km|mi}} up the St. Lawrence, which would have given the French troops one or two days to prepare for the attack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=50}}.</ref> Following the failed British assault on [[Battle of Beauport|Montmorency]], Montcalm altered his deployment, sending [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]] and a column of approximately 1,500 regular troops, 200 cavalry, and a group of New French militia\\u2014some 3,000 men in all\\u2014upriver to [[Cap-Rouge, Quebec|Cap-Rouge]] to monitor the British ships upstream.  He further strengthened his defences of the [[Beauport, Quebec City|Beauport]] shore following the abandonment of the British camp at Montmorency, which he regarded as preparations for a descent (amphibious attack) on Beauport.  In spite of warnings from local commanders, he did not view an upstream landing as a serious possibility.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|p=78}}.</ref>\\n[[File:Fleuve Saint-Laurent a Quebec.jpg|thumb|Anse au Foulon]]\\n\\nThe British, meanwhile, prepared for their risky deployment upstream.  Troops had already been aboard landing ships and drifting up and down the river for several days<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=125}}.</ref> when Wolfe on 12 September, made a final decision on the British landing site, selecting L'[[Anse-au-Foulon]].  L'Anse-au-Foulon is a cove situated west of the city, three kilometres upstream from [[Cap Diamant]].  It lies at the bottom of a {{cvt|53|m|ft|adj=on}} high cliff leading to the plateau above, and was protected by a battery of guns. It is not known why Wolfe selected Foulon, as the original landing site was to be further up the river, in a position where the British would be able to develop a foothold and strike at Bougainville's force to draw Montcalm out of Quebec and onto the plains. Brigadier-General [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]] wrote that \\\"by some intelligence the General had, he has changed his mind as to the place he intended to land\\\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=121}}.</ref> In his final letter, dated {{HMS|Sutherland|1741|6}}, 8:30&nbsp;p.m. 12 September, Wolfe wrote:\\n{{Quote|I had the honour to inform you today that it is my duty to attack the French army. To the best of my knowledge and ability, I have fixed upon that spot where we can act with most force and are most likely to succeed. If I am mistaken I am sorry for it and must be answerable to His Majesty and the public for the consequences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1959|p=117}}.</ref>}}\\n\\nWolfe's plan of attack depended on secrecy and surprise.  His plan required that a small party of men should land by night on the north shore, climb the [[Promontory of Quebec]], seize a small road, and overpower the garrison that protected it, allowing the bulk of his army (5,000 men) to ascend the cliff by the small road and then deploy for battle on the plateau.  Even if the first landing party succeeded in their mission and the army was able to follow, such a deployment would still leave his forces inside the French line of defence with no immediate retreat but the river.  It is possible that Wolfe's decision to change the landing site was owing less to a desire for secrecy and more to his general disdain for his brigadiers (a feeling that was reciprocated); it is also possible that he was still suffering the effects of his illness and the [[opiate]]s he used as painkillers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=353}}.</ref> Some revisionist historians believe Wolfe ordered the attack believing the advanced guard would be repulsed, and anticipated dying gallantly with his men rather than returning home in disgrace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|pp=354, 789}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Brumwell|2006|pp=269}}.</ref>\\n\\n==Order of battle==\\n{{wide image|Battle of Quebec 1759 SLNSW FL3542480.jpg|900px|Plan of Quebec and environs  with its defences and the occasional entrenched camps of the French commanded by Marquis de Montcalm shewing likewise the principal works and operations of the British forces, under the command of Major General Wolfe, during the siege of that place in 1759.}}\\n=== British forces ===\\nBritish forces engaged in the battle were commanded by [[Major General]] [[James Wolfe]] who commanded appx. 8,000 troops, of which only 4,500 men and 1  artillery gun were taken to the [[Plains of Abraham]].<ref name=\\\":0\\\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishbattles.com/french-indian-war/battle-of-quebec-1759/ |title=Battle of Quebec 1759 |website=www.britishbattles.com |access-date=2020-02-25 |archive-date=30 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130142530/https://www.britishbattles.com/french-indian-war/battle-of-quebec-1759/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\\\":1\\\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/index.php?title=1759-09-13_-_Battle_of_Qu%C3%A9bec#Order_of_Battle |title=1759-09-13 \\u2013 Battle of Qu\\u00e9bec \\u2013 Project Seven Years War |website=www.kronoskaf.com |access-date=2020-02-25 |archive-date=25 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925190426/http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/index.php?title=1759-09-13_-_Battle_of_Qu%C3%A9bec#Order_of_Battle |url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n'''British Army'''\\n* ''En potence'' on the right flank \\u2013 [[35th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* In reserve \\u2013 [[48th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* Protecting rear \\u2013 The Light Infantry ([[80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot]])\\n\\n'''Main Line''' under [[Major General]] [[James Wolfe]]\\n* [[Louisbourg Grenadiers]] (3 Companies)\\n* [[22nd Regiment of Foot]] (only grenadier and light infantry companies)\\n* [[40th Regiment of Foot]] (only grenadier and light infantry companies)\\n* [[45th Regiment of Foot]]\\n\\n'''Right Wing''' under [[Brigadier General]] [[Robert Monckton]]\\n* [[28th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* [[43rd Regiment of Foot]]\\n* 1 Light field gun provided by [[Royal Artillery]]\\n\\n'''Centre''' under [[Brigadier General]] [[James Murray (British Army officer, born 1721)|James Murray]]\\n* [[47th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* [[58th Regiment of Foot]] (also guarding the landing place)\\n* [[Fraser's Highlanders|78th (Fraser's) Highlanders]]\\n* 1 Light field gun provided by [[Royal Artillery]]\\n\\n'''Left Flank''' under [[Brigadier General]] [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]]\\n* [[15th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot]]\\n* 3rd Battalion, [[60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot]]\\n\\n'''Colonials'''\\n* The Light Infantry ([[80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot]]) (protecting the rear)\\n* 6 Companies of [[American Rangers]]\\n\\n=== French forces ===\\nFrench forces engaged in the battle were commanded by [[Major General]] [[Marquis De Montcalm|Louis Joseph de Saint V\\u00e9ran, Marquis de Montcalm]] commanding appx. 1,900 regulars, 1,500 militia and natives, and 4 field guns.<ref name=\\\":0\\\" /><ref name=\\\":1\\\" />\\n\\n'''Right Wing''' commanded by General Dumas\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de la Sarre]]\\n* [[Montr\\u00e9al]] and [[Qu\\u00e9bec]] Militia\\n* 2 field guns\\n\\n'''Centre''' under [[Major General]] [[Marquis De Montcalm|Louis Joseph de Saint V\\u00e9ran, Marquis de Montcalm]]\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de Languedoc]]\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de B\\u00e9arn]] (deep order, meaning they were not spread out)\\n\\n'''Left Wing''' under General Senezergues\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de Guyenne]] (deep order)\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment Royal Roussillon]]\\n* [[Montr\\u00e9al]] and [[Trois-Rivi\\u00e8res]] Militia\\n* 2 field guns\\n\\n==Landing==\\n[[File:Battle of the Plains of Abraham 1.svg|thumb|left|Landing of the British troops on 12 September]]\\nBougainville, tasked with the defence of the large area between [[Cap Diamant]] and [[Cap-Rouge, Quebec City|Cap Rouge]], was upstream with his troops at Cap Rouge on the night of 12 September, and missed seeing numerous British ships moving downstream.  A camp of approximately 100 militia led by Captain [[Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor]], who had unsuccessfully faced the British four years previously at [[Fort Beaus\\u00e9jour]], had been assigned to watch the narrow road at L'Anse-au-Foulon which followed a [[streambank]], the [[Coul\\u00e9e]] Saint-Denis. On the night of 12 September and morning of 13 September, however, the camp may have contained as few as 40 men, as others were off harvesting.<ref name=\\\"Lloyd 1959 103\\\"/> [[Pierre de Vaudreuil|Vaudreuil]] and others had expressed their concern at the possibility of L'Anse-au-Foulon being vulnerable, but Montcalm dismissed them, saying 100 men would hold off the army until daylight, remarking, \\\"It is not to be supposed that the enemies have wings so that they can in the same night cross the river, disembark, climb the obstructed acclivity, and scale the walls, for which last operation they would have to carry ladders.\\\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Casgrain|1905|p=160}}.</ref>\\n\\nSentries did detect boats moving along the river that morning, but they were expecting a French supply [[convoy]] to pass that night\\u2014a plan that had been changed without Vergor being notified.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=55}}.</ref> When the boats, loaded with the first wave of British troops, were challenged, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the [[78th Fraser Highlanders]], was able to answer the challenge in excellent French, allaying suspicion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=37}}; {{Harvnb|Lloyd|1959|p=125}}.</ref>\\n\\nThe boats, however, had drifted slightly off course: instead of landing at the base of the road, many soldiers found themselves at the base of a slope. A group of 24 volunteers led by Colonel [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] with fixed [[bayonet]]s were sent to clear the picket along the road, and climbed the slope, a manoeuvre that allowed them to come up behind Vergor's camp and capture it quickly.  Wolfe followed an hour later when he could use an easy access road to climb to the plain. Thus, by the time the sun rose over the Plains of Abraham, Wolfe's army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs of the [[promontory of Quebec]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|pp=58\\u201361}}.</ref>\\n\\n==Battle==\\n[[Image:NSRW Siege of Quebec.png|left|thumb|Map of the Quebec City area showing disposition of French and British forces.

Had the immediate defenders been more numerous, the British might have been unable to deploy or even been pushed back.  An officer who would normally have patrolled the cliffs regularly through the night was unable to on the night of the 12th because one of his horses had been stolen and his two others were lame.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1972|p=123}}.</ref> The first notice of the landing came from a runner who had fled from Vergor's camp, but one of Montcalm's aides felt the man was mad and sent him away, then went back to bed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=356}}.</ref> [[Charles Saunders (admiral)|Saunders]] had staged a diversionary action off Montmorency, firing on the shore emplacements through the night and loading boats with troops, many of them taken from [[field hospital]]s; this preoccupied Montcalm.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=355}}.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:SLIPPING AND STUMBLING, THE MEN WENT ON.gif|thumb|The British under General Wolfe climbing the heights of Quebec, 1759]]\\nMontcalm was taken aback to learn of the British deployment, and his response has been regarded as precipitate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=359}}.</ref> Though he might have awaited reinforcement by Bougainville's column (allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the British position) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces, or even yielded the city to Wolfe, he instead elected to confront Wolfe's force directly.

Many of the militia were inexperienced; the Acadian, Canadian, and indigenous [[irregulars]] were more used to guerrilla warfare. By contrast, the British 7,700 troops were almost all [[Regular Army|regulars]].\\n\\nOn the morning of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with their backs to the river, then spread out across the Plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=61}}.</ref>\\n\\nOf the British troops, approximately 3,300 formed into a shallow [[horseshoe]] formation that stretched across the width of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and [[gristmill]] to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire to keep them out of enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to the width of the lines.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=148}}.</ref> As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=69}}.</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:Montcalm leading his troops at the Plains of Abraham.jpg|thumb|Montcalm leading his troops into battle. Watercolour by [[Charles William Jefferys]] (1869\\u20131951)]]\\nAs French troops arrived from Beauport, Montcalm, one of few mounted men on the field, decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the British from their position.  Accordingly, he deployed the forces immediately available in and near Quebec City and prepared an immediate attack, without waiting for further reinforcements from the Beauport shore.  He arrayed his approximately 3,500 soldiers into place, his best regulars three deep, others six deep and his poorest regiment in column. At approximately 10&nbsp;a.m., Montcalm, riding his dark horse and waving his sword to encourage his men,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|p=86}}.</ref> ordered a general advance on the British line.\\n\\nAs a European-trained military leader, Montcalm's instinct was for large, set-piece battles in which regiments and soldiers moved in precise order.  Such actions required a disciplined soldiery, painstakingly drilled for as long as 18 months on the parade ground, trained to march in time, change formation at a word, and retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys.<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 197\\\"/> Though his regular regiments (the \\\"troupes de terre\\\" or \\\"metropolitans\\\") were adept at such formal warfare, in the course of the campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen, whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual: they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload, thus reducing the effect of concentrated fire at close range.<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 182\\\">{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=182}}.</ref>\\n\\n===Main engagement===\\n[[File:Battle of the Plains of Abraham 3.svg|thumb|left|French forces in retreat]]\\nAs the French approached, the British lines held their fire.

James Murray, the British commander, had experienced a terrible winter, in which scurvy had reduced his garrison to only 4,000. On 28 April, L\\u00e9vis' forces met and defeated the British at the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]], immediately west of the city (near the site of [[Universit\\u00e9 Laval]] today). This battle proved bloodier than that of the Plains of Abraham, with about 850 casualties on the French side and 1,100 on the British side. The French had defeated the British, but the British were able to withdraw within the walls of Quebec, to which the French [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|laid siege]]. A lack of artillery and ammunition, combined with British improvements to the fortifications, meant that the French were unable to take the city by storm. Both sides awaited reinforcements from Europe. The first ships to arrive, in mid-May, were part of a British fleet which had [[Battle of Neuville|defeated Levis' support ships]].<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 182\\\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|Jones|Smith|2000|pp=142\\u2013143}}.</ref> The success of the French army's offensive against Quebec in the spring of 1760 had depended on the dispatch of a French armada, with fresh troops and supplies.<ref name=\\\"Francis, Origins, pp. 142\\\" /> A naval battle fought at [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]], just off the coast of France, proved the decisive battle for this part of New France.

The French capitulated on 8 September, and the British took possession of Montreal. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed in 1763 to end the war and gave possession of parts of [[New France]] to Great Britain, including Canada and the eastern half of [[French Louisiana]]\\u2014lying between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{Citation needed|date = November 2016}}\\n\\n==Legacy==\\n[[Image:Battlefields Park Tables and Martello Tower.jpg|thumb|[[Martello Tower]] (constructed by the British 1808\\u20131812) in [[The Battlefields Park]], Quebec City]]\\n\\nIn 2009, a number of activities were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.<ref>[http://www.quebec09.com Official reenactors' website for the event] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014222423/http://www.quebec09.com/ |date=14 October 2017 }}. This website is not the official website of the event.</ref> A plan to hold a re-enactment of the battle itself (as well as a re-enactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]]) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as a slap in the face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/organizers-cancel-mock-battle-of-the-plains-of-abraham-1.787562 |title=CBC News: Organizers cancel mock Battle of the Plains of Abraham |access-date=24 September 2018 |archive-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027142038/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/organizers-cancel-mock-battle-of-the-plains-of-abraham-1.787562 |url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nAnother commemorative event was proposed for the anniversary, the ''Moulin \\u00e0 paroles''.

cruiser]] that was built for the [[Royal Navy]]. She is now permanently moored as a [[museum ship]] on the [[River Thames]] in [[London]] and is operated by the [[Imperial War Museum]].\\n\\nConstruction of ''Belfast'', the first ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the capital city of [[Northern Ireland]] and one of ten Town-class cruisers, began in December 1936. She was launched on [[St Patrick's Day]] 1938. Commissioned in early August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], ''Belfast'' was initially part of the British naval blockade against Germany. In November 1939, ''Belfast'' struck a German [[naval mine|mine]] and, in spite of fears that she would be scrapped, spent more than two years undergoing extensive repairs. ''Belfast'' returned to action in November 1942 with improved firepower, radar equipment, and armour. ''Belfast'' saw action escorting [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] to the [[Soviet Union]] during 1943 and in December 1943 played an important role in the [[Battle of North Cape]], assisting in the destruction of the German warship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}. In June 1944, ''Belfast'' took part in [[Operation Overlord]] supporting the [[Normandy landings]]. In June 1945, she was redeployed to the Far East to join the [[British Pacific Fleet]], arriving shortly before the end of the Second World War. ''Belfast'' saw further combat action in {{nowrap|1950\\u201352}} during the [[Korean War]] and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959. A number of further overseas commissions followed before she entered reserve in 1963.\\n\\nIn 1967, efforts were initiated to avert ''Belfast''{{'s}} expected scrapping and to preserve her as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]], and the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] was established and then reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971, however, the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS ''Belfast'' Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971.

Bruce Fraser, C-in-C Home Fleet, expected and hoped that the German battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} would sortie from its Norwegian base and attempt to attack Convoy JW 55B sailing from Scotland to Murmansk in the USSR. And indeed, on 25 December 1943, Christmas Day, ''Scharnhorst'' left port in northern Norway to attack Convoy JW 55B. The next day Force One, which had left Murmansk on the 23rd, encountered ''Scharnhorst'', prevented her from attacking the convoy, and forced her to retreat after being damaged by the British cruisers. As ''Scharnhorst'' attacked again at noon she was intercepted by Force Two and sunk by the combined formations. ''Belfast'' played an important role in the battle; as flagship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, she was among the first to encounter ''Scharnhorst'', and coordinated the squadron's defence of the convoy.

By 1949, the political situation in China was precarious, with the [[Chinese Civil War]] moving towards its conclusion. As flagship of the 5th Cruiser Squadron, ''Belfast'' was the Far Eastern Station's headquarters ship during the April 1949 [[Amethyst Incident|''Amethyst'' Incident]], in which a British [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]], {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}}, was trapped in the [[Yangtze River]] by the communist [[People's Liberation Army]]. ''Belfast'' remained in Hong Kong during 1949, sailing for [[Singapore]] on 18 January 1950. There she underwent a minor refit between January and March 1950, and in June she joined the Far East Fleet's summer cruise.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=73\\u201376}} On 25 June 1950, while ''Belfast'' was visiting [[Hakodate, Hokkaid\\u014d|Hakodate]] in Japan, North Korean forces crossed the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]], starting the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=76}}\\n\\n==Korean War 1950{{ndash}}1952==\\n[[File:HMS Belfast bombarding Korea.jpg|thumb|March 1951: At anchor, ''Belfast'' fires a salvo against enemy troop concentrations on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula.]]\\n\\nWith the outbreak of the Korean War, ''Belfast'' became part of the [[United Nations]] naval forces. Originally part of the US Navy's [[Task Force 77 (United States Navy)|Task Force 77]], ''Belfast'' was detached in order to operate independently on 5 July 1950. During July and early August 1950, ''Belfast'' undertook coastal patrols and was based at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] in Japan's [[Nagasaki Prefecture]]. From 19 July ''Belfast'' supported troops fighting around Yongdok, accompanied by {{USS|Juneau|CL-119|6}}.

On 1 June she arrived at Singapore for refitting, arriving back on patrol on 31 August. In September 1951 ''Belfast'' provided anti-aircraft cover for a salvage operation to recover a crashed enemy [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] jet fighter. She conducted further bombardments and patrols before receiving a month's leave from operations, returning to action on 23 December.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=84}}\\n\\nIn 1952 ''Belfast'' continued her coastal patrol duties. On 29 July 1952 ''Belfast'' was hit by enemy fire while engaging an [[artillery battery]] on Wolsa-ri island. A 75&nbsp;mm shell struck a forward compartment, killing a British sailor of Chinese origin in his hammock and wounding four other Chinese ratings. This was the only time ''Belfast'' was hit by enemy fire during her Korean service. On 27 September 1952 ''Belfast'' was relieved by two other Town-class cruisers, {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|6}} and HMS&nbsp;''Newcastle'', and sailed back to the UK. She had steamed over {{convert|80000|mi|km}} in the combat zone and fired more than 8,000 rounds from her 6-inch guns during the Korean War.

Changes included: individual MRS8 directors for the new twin Mk 5 40&nbsp;mm and the twin 4-inch mount; the 4-inch guns training and elevation speed was increased to 20 degrees per second; and protecting key parts of the ship against [[Weapon of mass destruction|nuclear, biological or chemical]] attack. This last consideration meant significantly enlarging and enclosing her [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], creating a two-tiered, five-sided superstructure which radically altered her appearance. Her boiler rooms were also given remote control so they could still be run in the event of a nuclear, biological or chemical attack as the boiler rooms themselves were not protected. The most significant change was better accommodations for a smaller crew more fitting of post-war needs. Her tripod masts were replaced with lattice masts and timber decking replaced with steel everywhere except the quarterdeck. The overall effect was to create a cruiser significantly more habitable but different internally and to a degree in external appearance from wartime cruisers but still essentially a surface warfare, 'anti [[Sverdlov-class cruiser|Sverdlov]]' cruiser, with anti-aircraft defence updated for point defence only out to {{cvt|4|km}}.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=79\\u201390}} \\n\\n''Belfast'' recommissioned at Devonport on 12 May 1959.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=87\\u201390}} Her close-range armament was standardised to six twin 40&nbsp;mm Bofors guns, and her close-range fire direction similarly standardised to eight close-range blindfire directors fitted with [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 262|Type 262]] radar.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=14}} Her 1959 radar fit included two Type 274 lock and follow radar directors for main armament direction against sea and land targets,{{efn|other 1950s cruiser reconstructions of three Town cruisers and HMS ''Newfoundland'' and HMS ''Ceylon'' had only a single main 274 director which limited their surface effectiveness}} [[Type 277 radar#P and Q models|Type 277Q]] and 293Q for height-finding and surface warning, Type 960M for air warning, and 974 for surface warning.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=88}} In order to save weight, her torpedo armament was removed.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=88}} Modern passive sonar Type 174 and 176 was installed and noise-reducing rubber insulation fitted to the propeller shaft.{{sfn|Wingate|2004}}{{page needed|date=March 2019}}\\n\\n''Belfast'' arrived in Singapore on 16 December 1959 and spent most of 1960 at sea on exercise, calling at ports in Hong Kong, Borneo, India, [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), Australia, the Philippines and Japan. On 31 January 1961, ''Belfast'' recommissioned under the command of Captain [[Morgan Morgan-Giles]]. On her final foreign commission ''Belfast'' joined a number of exercises in the Far East and in December 1961 she provided the British guard of honour at [[Tanganyika (1961\\u20131964)|Tanganyika]]'s independence ceremony in [[Dar-es-Salaam]].{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=90\\u201399}}\\n\\nIn 1961 plans were drawn up for the conversion of ''Belfast'' to a hybrid helicopter cruiser for amphibious operations. The two aft 6-inch turrets would be removed to accommodate a helicopter deck and two hangars capable of housing four [[Westland Wessex]] helicopters, while the 4-inch guns would be replaced by [[davit]]s for four [[Landing Craft Assault|LCA]] landing craft. Only one of the ship's two boiler rooms would be used, which together with the reductions in armament would allow the ship's crew to be reduced so freeing up space to carry troops. Two infantry [[Company (military unit)|companies]], 30 officers and 230 other ranks, would be carried. The plan was rejected in December 1961 as the time required to carry out the conversions was too great.{{sfn|Waters|2019|pp=192\\u2013194}}\\n\\n[[File:HMS Belfast (C35) at Pearl Harbor in 1962.jpg|left|thumb|''Belfast'' at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, in 1962.]]\\nThe ship left Singapore on 26 March 1962 for the UK, sailing east via Hong Kong, Guam and [[Pearl Harbor]], San Francisco, Seattle, British Columbia, Panama and Trinidad.

He later returned to Germany to attend the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|''Technische Hochschule'' in Berlin]], earning a [[Doctor of Engineering]] degree.\\n\\nAs an engineer, Casey prepared a voluminous report on flood control for the [[Pittsburgh]] District.

He went to the [[Philippines]] in 1937 to advise the government there on [[hydropower]] and flood control. In the early part of [[World War II]],  he became involved with the enormous wartime construction program. Perhaps his most notable and lasting achievement was his involvement with the design of [[The Pentagon]], the largest office building in the world.\\n\\nCasey served as [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[engineering|chief engineer]] during the [[Battle of Bataan]], in the jungles and mountains of [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]] and the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\\u201345)|Philippines]], and during the [[occupation of Japan]]. In the [[Battle of Leyte]], he commanded the Army Support Command (ASCOM), which was responsible for all construction and logistics activities in the forward area. He hoped to become [[Chief of Engineers]], but [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] passed him over.

One of Casey's duties was tutoring Oliphant in mathematics. Casey decided that winning games was more important than playing, and he helped keep Oliphant proficient at math. Unlike most appointees to West Point, a grateful Casey wrote frequently to Griffin about his progress and sent him football tickets. When Casey's younger brother Martin Charles Casey wanted to enter West Point, Griffin directly appointed him to the class of 1920 without having to pass the examination. Martin served with the [[coastal artillery]] for eleven years before being medically discharged due to [[migraine]] headaches on 30 November 1931.

The Corps of Engineers was criticized by the Pittsburgh Flood Control Commission for over-engineering, in planning for a \\\"flood that had never happened and never would happen\\\", and the report was shelved. However, [[Pittsburgh Flood of 1936|in 1936 the flood did happen]]. The report was then dusted off and its recommendations were adopted. The [[Flood Control Act of 1936]] assigned responsibility for flood control to the Corps of Engineers and other Federal agencies.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=76\\u201379}}</ref> Casey was also responsible for construction at Deadman Island Lock and Dam (now called the [[Dashields Locks and Dam]]) on the [[Ohio River]].<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1929|pp=444\\u2013451}}</ref>\\n\\nIn September 1929 Casey was assigned to the Rivers and Harbors Section of the Office of the Chief of Engineers in [[Washington, DC]]. This job involved reviewing the project studies, plans and specifications of all river and harbor projects throughout the United States, including flood control and [[hydroelectric power]] projects. He also had responsibility for correspondence with [[U.S. senators]] and congressmen.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=23}}</ref> During this time he co-designed and patented the Kingman-Casey Floating Mooring Bit for navigation locks.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. xiv\\\"/><ref>US Patent no. 1,997,586, dated 16 April 1935</ref> He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 1 May 1933.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. xiii\\\">{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=xiii}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey won a John R.

For the next two years, he attended the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|''Technische Hochschule'' in Berlin]], earning a [[Doctor of Engineering|Doctorate in Engineering]]. His thesis, written in German, was on ''Geschieb Bewegung'', the bedload movement in streams.<ref>{{cite web |title=''\\u00dcber Geschiebebewegung'' |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=+bibliogroup:%22Mitteilungen+der+Preu%C3%9Fischen+Versuchsanstalt+f%C3%BCr+Wasserbau+und+Schiffbau%22 |publisher=Preussische Druckerei-und Verlags-Aktiengesellschaft |access-date=22 June 2010 |language=de }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=99\\u2013100}}</ref> Returning to the United States in June 1935, Casey was posted to [[Eastport, Maine]] as chief of the Engineering Division at the [[Passamaquoddy Bay#The Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project/\\\"Quoddy Dam\\\" Project|Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project]], a [[New Deal]] public works project. There, he established a concrete testing laboratory under Charles E. Wuerpel which is now part of the Structures Laboratory at the [[Waterways Experiment Station]] at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].

They worked with [[Meralco]] and other power companies in the Philippines, and conducted a series of surveys, including a detailed one of the [[Agno River]]. After Clay returned to the United States, Casey developed plans for the [[Caliraya Dam]], a  {{convert|40000|hp|kW}} hydroelectric project with an estimated cost of $5 million.

Working with a staff that included [[George Bergstrom]], a former president of the [[American Institute of Architects]],<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=266}}</ref> Casey set about revising the standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new [[triangular division]], 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the [[cantonment]] areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=347\\u2013354}}</ref> Casey was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on 8 April 1941.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. xiii\\\"/>\\n\\nOn the afternoon of Thursday, 17 July 1941, Somervell summoned Casey and Bergstrom and gave them a new special project: the design of an enormous office complex to house the [[United States Department of War|War Department's]] 40,000-person staff together in one building. Somervell gave them until 09:00 on Monday morning to design the building, which he envisaged as a modern, four-story structure with no elevators, on the site of the old [[Hoover Field|Washington Hoover Airport]].  This would ultimately become [[The Pentagon]], the largest office building in the world.  Over that \\\"very busy weekend\\\", Casey, Bergstrom and their staff roughed out the design for a four-story, five-sided structure with a floor area of {{convert|5100000|sqft|sqm}}\\u2014twice that of the [[Empire State Building]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=431 }}</ref> The estimated cost was $35 million.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=432}}</ref> [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D.

Casey.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Major General Hugh J. Casey at his desk in Brisbane|alt=A name plaque reads: \\\"Maj. Gen. Hugh J. Casey\\\". The wall behind him is covered in huge map of New Guinea.]]\\nIn [[Australia]], Casey became Chief Engineer at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ), [[Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA). He faced enormous engineering challenges. Most of [[New Guinea]] consisted of mountains and jungle, with very few airstrips, ports or roads. All of these had to be developed to support operations. To provide additional expertise in construction, Casey had [[Leif Sverdrup]] assigned to his staff as chief of the Construction Section, with the rank of colonel. As U.S. Army engineers were few, Casey worked closely with his [[Australian Army]] counterpart at [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]]'s Allied Land Forces headquarters, [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[Clive Steele]]. Construction activities in Australia were also undertaken by civilians of the [[Allied Works Council]]. Casey attempted to coordinate the activities of the various agencies. He had to fend off attempts by the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was Casey able to control their activities.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=130\\u2013137}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey's initial need was for engineer units to accomplish the daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of [[tractor]]s, [[grader]]s, [[concrete mixer]]s and [[welding]] equipment. In the absence of a proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.\\n<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=260\\u2013}}</ref>\\n\\nIn September 1942, MacArthur decided to outflank Japanese troops on the [[Kokoda Trail]] by sending an American [[regimental combat team]] over the [[Owen Stanley Range]]. Two alternate means of crossing the mountains seemed possible. One, the [[Kapa Kapa Trail]] was known to climb to elevations above {{convert|9000|ft|m}} and present formidable obstacles. Casey and Sverdrup took charge of investigating the Abau Trail. They reached Abau on 18 September. Casey explored the harbor, taking depth soundings from a native canoe. Sverdrup set out for Jaure with a party of one American, two Australians from the [[Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit]], ten native police from the [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary|Royal Papuan Constabulary]] and 26 native carriers. After eight days on the trail, scaling heights of {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, Sverdrup concluded that it would not be practical for troops to traverse the route and turned back. Meanwhile, Casey had concluded that the harbor was too shallow even for [[lighter (barge)|lighters]]. However, the trip was not a total loss, for Sverdrup had sighted a plateau north of the Owen Stanley Range suitable for airstrips, allowing troops to be flown across the Owen Stanley Range.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=178\\u2013180}}</ref> Casey was awarded the [[Silver Star]].<ref name=\\\"medals\\\"/>\\n\\nIn New Guinea, logistics and construction activities were coordinated by task force engineer staffs. These were often hastily assembled and had not always been able to meet the demands imposed by base development in such a challenging theater of operations. The scale of operations in the Philippines was much greater, so for this purpose the Army Service Command (ASCOM) was formed in Brisbane on 23 July 1944. Casey was appointed to command ASCOM. In his absence, Sverdrup became MacArthur's chief engineer. Although part of [[USASOS]], ASCOM operated under the control of [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]], moving as far forward as combat operations allowed, developed new bases, and operated them until [[USASOS]] was ready to take over, at which point the units under ASCOM simply reverted to USASOS, allowing a seamless transfer of command.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|p=571}}</ref> For the [[Battle of Leyte]] Casey's ASCOM had 43,000 men, of whom 21,000 were engineers.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|p=575}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey and some members of his staff came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM headquarters arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at [[Tacloban City|Tacloban]], and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=579\\u2013581}}</ref> Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and it was decided to abandon their development and construct a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. The need to get aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General [[Walter Krueger]] agreed to move his headquarters.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=583\\u2013584}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey had intended to come ashore on the first day of the [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|landing at Lingayen Gulf]] in January 1945 but was delayed a day because the destroyer he was traveling on had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon Base Section (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=598\\u2013601}}</ref> For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]]. He was subsequently awarded a bronze [[oak leaf cluster]] to his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.<ref name=\\\"medals\\\"/>\\n\\nCasey hoped to become [[Chief of Engineers]] when Lieutenant General [[Raymond A. Wheeler]] retired in 1948, but President [[Harry S. Truman]] passed him over in favor of the Missouri River Division Engineer, Major General [[Lewis A. Pick]]. Instead, Casey remained in Japan as MacArthur's Chief Engineer until Casey's retirement on 31 December 1949.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=270\\u2013271}}</ref> He edited ''Engineers of the Southwest Pacific'', a seven-volume series about their wartime service.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. x\\\"/> He received a number of foreign awards for his service, including the [[Distinguished Service Star]] from the Philippines, the [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] from Australia, the Commander of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] from the Netherlands, and the Officer of [[L\\u00e9gion d'honneur]] from France.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=xi\\u2013xv}}</ref>\\n\\n==Later life==\\nCasey was Chairman of the [[New York City Transit Authority]] from 1953 to 1955, and served in various positions with [[Schenley Industries]] from 1951 until his retirement in 1965.

A survey dispute with Salisbury led to the forfeiture of Gamaliel Painter's farm to that town, and his transition from farming to developing [[Middlebury (village), Vermont|Middlebury Village]] near his and Abisha Washburn's mill, together with other mills that surrounded the [[Otter Creek (Vermont)|Otter Creek]] falls. Industries would include a [[cotton]] factory, [[sawmill]], [[gristmill]], [[Bucket|pail]] factory, [[paper mill]], [[woolen]] factory, [[iron]] [[foundry]], and [[marble]] [[quarry]]. The [[Rutland and Burlington Railroad|Rutland & Burlington Railroad]] first arrived on September 1, 1849. Around 1830, Middlebury was the second-largest town in Vermont.\\n\\n[[Middlebury College]], one of the United States' elite [[liberal arts college]]s, was founded in 1800. It is a member of the [[NESCAC]]. In the summer, the town plays host to the annual [[Middlebury College Language Schools]], as well as the college's [[Bread Loaf Writers' Conference]], the oldest surviving conference of its kind in the nation.\\n\\nOn January 2, 1838, a group of ''Patriote'' refugees from the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] met in Middlebury to plan their future course of action.  It was attended by two major ''Patriote'' leaders, [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]], but they were not able to agree on a unified plan.<ref>Fernand Ouellet, [http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/papineau_louis_joseph_10E.html \\\"Papineau, Louis-Joseph\\\"], ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'', vol.

Downtown hosts a three-screen movie theater, the post office, and two historic inns, as well as many shops and restaurants. There is considerable development along [[U.S. Route 7]] heading south of town, including two supermarkets, two drugstores, most of the town's gas stations, and several fast-food spots. Of note is Middlebury's [[A&W Restaurants|A&W]], Vermont's only remaining [[car-hop]] restaurant and a popular spot with both locals and Middlebury College students.\\n\\n==Geography==\\nMiddlebury is located near the center of Addison County in western Vermont. The town is drained by [[Otter Creek (Vermont)|Otter Creek]], which flows from south to north along the western edge of the town, with the falls at the center of the village.

The population was 436 at the 2020 census.\\n\\n==History==\\nThe original town of Scales Mound was located at the base of an erosional remnant similar to [[Charles Mound]], about a mile southwest of the present-day village. In 1830 [[Samuel Scales]] purchased the original village site from John Sole and built a tavern at the base of the mound along Sucker Trail, a major east-west corridor. The land that the present-day village of Scales Mound is on was purchased from the U.S. government in 1848 by a man named Dunning. Little is known about Dunning or the use of the land until the 1850s.<ref name=nrhp>Mansberger, Floyd. \\\"[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/200844.pdf Scales Mound Historic District]\\\", ([[PDF]]), National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, May 2, 1990, ''[[Illinois Historic Preservation Agency]]'', accessed May 17, 2008.</ref>\\n\\nIn 1851 the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] (ICRR) was established and it would become a major factor in the settlement of much of rural Illinois, including Scales Mound. In September 1853, anticipating the arrival of the railroad, the village of Scales Mound was [[plat]]ted by Josiah Conlee and B.B. Provost. During the summer of 1854 track crews from ICRR laid out {{convert|20|mi|km}} of track between Scales Mound and [[Apple River, Illinois|Apple River]] and trains were running the line the day after completion. With the arrival of the railroad, Scales Mound's first building was constructed in the late fall 1854; a store built by Sherman Eddy.<ref name=nrhp/>\\n\\n==Demographics==\\n{{US Census population\\n|1880= 311\\n|1900= 418\\n|1910= 388\\n|1920= 356\\n|1930= 348\\n|1940= 354\\n|1950= 385\\n|1960= 399\\n|1970= 382\\n|1980= 347\\n|1990= 388\\n|2000= 401\\n|2010= 376\\n|2020= 436\\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\\\"DecennialCensus\\\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\\n}}\\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\\\"GR2\\\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 31, 2008|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 401 people, 164 households, and 108 families residing in the village.

It has been struck intermittently since 1820, though as a circulation coin only in 1887, 1893 and 1902. Through most of its history, it has depicted, on its reverse, [[Benedetto Pistrucci]]'s portrayal of [[St George and the Dragon]], which has traditionally been used on the [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]], or one-pound gold coin.\\n\\nThe five-pound piece was one of the original denominations of gold coins authorised as part of the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]]. It was not struck until 1820, and then only as a [[pattern coin]]. It was issued again in small numbers in 1826, 1829 and 1839, with the last using the well-regarded depiction of [[Una and the Lion]] by [[William Wyon]]. Although the Una coin was for sale for almost half a century at the [[Royal Mint]], only about 400 are believed to have been struck.\\n\\nIn 1887, it was struck for the first time for circulation, and this also took place in 1893 and 1902, though few actually circulated; examples struck in 1911 were only available as part of a [[proof set]]. In 1887 and 1902 it was struck in very small numbers at the [[Sydney Mint]], with examples bearing its [[mint mark]] S. The examples struck in preparation for the coinage of [[Edward VIII]] are highly prized; one sold in 2021 for \\u00a31,654,000, the highest price paid for a British coin.\\n\\nSince 1980, the five-pound gold piece has been struck in most years by the Royal Mint for sale to collectors and holders of [[bullion]]. Although generally featuring Pistrucci's design, commemorative versions have been issued, such as in 2022, as a memorial following the [[death of Elizabeth II]], featuring the bust of her son and successor, [[Charles III]].\\n\\n== Origins ==\\n{{for|further information regarding the beginnings and history of the modern sovereign coinage, as well as discussion of the St George and dragon reverse design|Sovereign (British coin)}}\\n{{Featured article}}\\n\\nThe [[Five Guineas (British coin)|five guinea]] gold coin started out in 1668 as a coin worth one hundred [[shilling (English coin)|shillings]] (five pounds), and was sometimes called a five-pound coin. This was before the fluctuating value of the [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]] settled at twenty-one [[shilling (British coin)|shillings]] in 1717. According to Richard Lobel, in his ''Coincraft's Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins'', there is some argument that the five-pound piece issued after the [[Great Recoinage of 1816]] was merely a continuation of the earlier coin, which had last been struck in 1753. However, Lobel separates the two series in his catalogue.{{sfn|Lobel|pp=421, 426\\u2013427}}\\n\\nAfter the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], by the [[Coinage Act 1816]], placed Britain officially on the [[gold standard]], with the pound to be defined as a given quantity of gold. Almost every speaker supported having a coin valued at twenty shillings, rather than continuing to use the guinea.{{sfn|Clancy|pp=52\\u201355}} One reason for the introduction of gold coinage based on the sovereign was that its value, equal to one pound sterling, was more convenient than the guinea, equal to twenty-one shillings.{{sfn|Seaby|p=147}} Nevertheless, the Coinage Act did not specify which coins the Mint should strike.{{sfn|Seaby|pp=116\\u2013117}}\\n\\nA committee of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] recommended gold coins of ten shillings, twenty shillings, [[double sovereign|two pounds]] and five pounds be issued, and this was accepted by [[George, Prince Regent]] on 3{{nbs}}August 1816.{{sfn|Marsh|p=7}} The twenty-shilling piece was named a sovereign, with the resurrection of [[sovereign (English coin)|the old name]] possibly promoted by antiquarians with [[numismatic]] interests.{{sfn|Clancy|p=57}} The sovereign and [[half sovereign]] were both first issued in 1817, but there was initially no striking of the two larger coins.{{sfn|Spink 2004|pp=389\\u2013390}} Since 1754, there had been no issuance of coins more valuable than a guinea intended for general circulation; the need for higher value tender had been met by bank notes.{{sfn|Bull|p=3}} The [[St George and the dragon]] design was suggested as an appropriate motif for the sovereign by its creator, [[Benedetto Pistrucci]], based on a [[cameo (carving)|cameo]] he had carved.{{sfn|Clancy|p=58}}\\n\\n== Early issues ==\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = 1820 five pounds obverse.jpeg\\n | image2 = 1820 five pounds reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = George III five-pound piece\\n | alt1 = Gold coin showing a man's bust\\n| alt2= Gold coin showing a naked man, intended to be a knight, battling a dragon\\n}}\\nThe first striking of the five-pound denomination after the coinage reform was in 1820 as a [[pattern coin]], depicting [[George III]] ({{reign|1760|1820}}). The obverse shows the right-facing bust of the king with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|GEORGIUS III D G BRITANNIAR REX F D}}}} (George III by the grace of God king of the Britains, defender of the faith) and the date, while the reverse shows Pistrucci's George and dragon design with no legend or date. This design had first appeared on the sovereign in 1817, surrounded by a [[Order of the Garter|Garter]].{{sfn|Lobel|p=453}} The design has Pistrucci's surname at the lower left, with the initials of the master of the Mint, [[William Wellesley-Pole]], near the broken spear.{{sfn|Bull|p=2}}\\n\\nLobel, in describing the 1820 five-pound piece, noted that on a copy of G. F. Crowther's 1887 book, ''A Guide to English Pattern Coins'' presented to an unknown person with the publisher's compliments, there is a pencil notation that work on the 1820 piece was completed a few days before George III's death, and after Pistrucci, walking home on the day the king died, heard church bells announcing the demise. He then returned to the [[Royal Mint]] and instructed that some five-pound coins be struck the next morning. Lobel described this as a \\\"fascinating episode of numismatic history\\\".{{sfn|Lobel|p=717}} The numismatist [[Edward Hawkins (numismatist)|Edward Hawkins]], writing in 1850, also wrote dramatically, describing what he deemed heroic efforts to ensure that the pattern double sovereigns and five-pound coins were actually struck before the king died, but [[William John Hocking]] and others have since studied the matter, concluding the coinage dies were not completed until after the king's death on 29 January. The approximately 25 specimens were distributed among Royal Mint officials, prominent numismatists and other important people of the day, as well as given to the Royal Mint and [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Bull|pp=3\\u20134}} One sold in October 2021 for about \\u00a3635,000.{{sfn|Bull|p=6}}\\n\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = 1826 five pounds obverse.jpg\\n | image2 = 1826 five pounds reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = George IV five-pound piece\\n | alt1 = Gold coin showing a man's bust\\n| alt2= Gold coin showing a heraldic shield\\n}}\\nThe next appearance of the denomination was in the reign of [[George IV]] ({{reign|1820|1830}}), in 1826, included in the [[proof set]] of that year. One piece is known dated 1829. The obverse shows the left-facing bust of the king with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|GEORGIUS IV DEI GRATIA}}}} (George IV by the grace of God&nbsp;...) while the reverse shows a crowned shield within a mantle cape with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|BRITANNIARUM REX FID DEF}}}} (King of the Britains, defender of the faith). The 1826 coin has the edge inscription {{lang|la|{{small|DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI SEPTIMO}}}} (An ornament and a safeguard; seventh year of the reign), while the 1829 coin has a plain edge. No five-pound coins were issued during the reign of [[William IV]] ({{reign|1830|1837}}).{{sfn|Lobel|p=427}}\\n\\n==Victoria five-pound coins==\\n{{multiple image\\n | align = right\\n | total_width = 400\\n | image1 = Una and lion obverse.jpeg\\n | image2 = Una and lion reverse.jpeg\\n | footer = \\\"Una and the Lion\\\" piece\\n | alt1 = Gold coin showing a woman's bust\\n| alt2= Gold coin showing a woman leading a lion\\n}}\\nThe next coin of this value did not appear until early in the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] ({{reign|1837|1901}}), when what Lobel deems one of the most famous and attractive of all British coins was produced. This piece, known as the ''[[Una and the Lion]]'' coin, is described by him as having \\\"cult status\\\".{{sfn|Lobel|p=427}} Una and the Lion appear in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s 16th century epic ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''. The obverse shows the young head of the queen, facing left with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|VICTORIA D G BRITANNIARUM REGINA F D}}}} (Victoria by the grace of God queen of the Britains, defender of the faith), while the reverse shows her as Una leading the lion to the left, with the legend {{lang|la|{{small|DIRIGE DEUS GRESSUS MEOS}}}} (May the Lord direct my steps), though some coins say {{lang|la|{{small|DIRIGIT DEUS GRESSUS MEOS}}}}, thus \\\"The Lord directs my steps\\\" \\u2013 with the date MDCCCXXXIX (1839) in the [[exergue]] under the lion.

The Royal Mint had decided to make as few changes as possible for King Edward's coinage, and the Pistrucci reverse continued for the gold coins. Five-pound coins were issued both at face value and in the proof sets issued to commemorate the [[coronation of Edward VII]].

The 1953 strikings bore an obverse legend of {{lang|la|{{small|ELIZABETH II DEI GRA BRITT OMN REGINA F D}}}} (Elizabeth II by the grace of God queen of all the Britains, defender of the faith) but this was changed for 1957, removing {{lang|la|{{small|BRITT OMN}}}} (of all the Britains).{{sfn|Lobel|p=430}} This change was made to acknowledge the evolving [[British Commonwealth]], which by then contained some republics.{{sfn|Seaby|p=172}} The resulting wording continued to be used on Elizabeth's coinage, with variations in the abbreviations.{{sfn|Marsh|pp=96\\u2013106}} \\n\\nNo further \\u00a35 gold pieces were struck until 1980, nine years after decimalisation.{{sfn|Lobel|pp=430\\u2013431}} The Royal Mint realised there was a market for sovereign coins, and began to sell them to collectors at well over face or [[bullion]] value.{{sfn|Bull|p=305}} Beginning in 1980, five-pound gold coins were sold every year, except 1983, sometimes in a four-piece proof set with the half sovereign, sovereign and double sovereign, and sometimes sold individually.

Pieces up to 1984 used an obverse portrait of Elizabeth by [[Arnold Machin]], and later ones up to 1997 by [[Raphael Maklouf]], excepting the 1989 issue, which featured special designs by [[Bernard Sindall]] in honour of the 500th anniversary of the sovereign coin.{{sfn|Lobel|pp=430\\u2013431}}{{sfn|Spink 2004|pp=475, 482}}{{sfn|Spink 2017|pp=105\\u2013106}}\\n\\nFrom 1998, a new obverse portrait of Elizabeth by [[Ian Rank-Broadley]] was used on the five-pound piece.{{sfn|Spink 2017|p=106}} This was used up to 2015.

Its name is the [[latin]]ization of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[krater]]'', a type of [[cup]] used to water down [[wine]]. One of the 48 constellations listed by the second-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], it depicts a cup that has been associated with the god [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]] and is perched on the back of [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] the water snake.\\n\\nThere is no [[star]] brighter than third [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] in the constellation. Its two brightest stars, [[Delta Crateris]] of magnitude 3.56 and [[Alpha Crateris]] of magnitude 4.07, are ageing orange [[giant star]]s that are cooler and larger than the [[Sun]]. [[Beta Crateris]] is a [[binary star]] system composed of a white giant star and a [[white dwarf]]. Seven star systems have been found to host [[Exoplanet|planets]]. A few notable [[galaxies]], including [[Crater 2]] and [[NGC 3981]], and a famous [[quasar]] lie within the borders of the constellation.\\n\\n==Mythology==\\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Noctua, Corvus, Crater, Sextans Urani\\u00e6, Hydra, Felis, Lupus, Centaurus, Antlia Pneumatica, Argo Navis, and Pyxis Nautica.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Corvus, Crater, and other constellations seen around Hydra, from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825).

He told how the city of Eleusa near [[Troy]] was beset by plague. Its ruler Demiphon consulted an oracle which decreed that a maiden should be sacrificed each year. Demiphon declared that he would choose a maiden by lottery, but he did not include his own daughters. One nobleman, Mastusius, objected, forcing Demiphon to sacrify his daughter. Later, Mastusius killed Demiphon's daughters and tricked the ruler in drinking a cup containing a mixture of their blood and wine. Upon finding out the deed, the king ordered Mastusius and the cup to be thrown into the sea.

It is a [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] that is [[density|denser]] than most common materials. Lead is [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness#Intermediate hardness|soft]] and [[malleable]], and also has a relatively low [[melting point]]. When freshly cut, lead is a shiny gray with a hint of blue. It [[tarnish]]es to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any [[stable nuclide|stable element]] and three of its [[isotope]]s are endpoints of major nuclear [[decay chain]]s of heavier elements.\\n\\nLead is a relatively unreactive [[post-transition metal]]. Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its [[amphoteric]] nature; lead and [[lead oxide]]s react with [[acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|bases]], and it tends to form [[covalent bond]]s. [[Compounds of lead]] are usually found in the +2 [[oxidation state]] rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the [[carbon group]]. Exceptions are mostly limited to [[organolead compound]]s. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to [[catenation|bond with itself]]; it can form chains and polyhedral structures.\\n\\nSince lead is easily extracted from its [[ore]]s, prehistoric people in the Near East [[metals of antiquity|were aware of it]]. [[Galena]] is a principal ore of lead which often bears silver.  Interest in silver helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in [[ancient Rome]]. Lead production declined after the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] and did not reach comparable levels until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Lead played a crucial role in the development of the [[printing press]], as [[movable type]] could be relatively easily cast from lead alloys.{{sfn|Theodore Low De Vinne|1899|pp=9\\u201336}} In 2014, the annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, [[ductility]] and relative inertness to [[oxidation]] make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, [[lead\\u2013acid batteries|batteries]], bullets and [[lead shot|shot]], weights, [[solder]]s, [[pewter]]s, [[fusible alloy]]s, [[lead paint|white paints]], [[leaded gasoline]], and [[lead shielding|radiation shield]]ing.\\n\\nLead is a [[neurotoxin]] that accumulates in soft tissues and bones. It damages the [[nervous system]] and interferes with the function of biological [[enzyme]]s, causing [[neurological disorder]]s ranging from behavioral problems to brain damage, and also affects general health, cardiovascular, and renal systems. [[lead poisoning|Lead's toxicity]] was first documented by ancient Greek and Roman writers, who noted some of the symptoms of lead poisoning, but became widely recognized in Europe in the late 19th century.\\n\\n== Physical properties ==\\n\\n=== Atomic ===\\nA lead [[atom]] has 82 [[electron]]s, arranged in an [[electron configuration]] of &#91;[[xenon|Xe]]&#93;4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>6p<sup>2</sup>. The sum of lead's first and second [[ionization energy|ionization energies]]\\u2014the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons\\u2014is close to that of [[tin]], lead's upper neighbor in the [[carbon group]]. This is unusual; ionization energies generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer electrons become more distant from the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]], and more [[shielding effect|shielded]] by smaller orbitals.\\n\\nThe sum of the first four ionization energies of lead exceeds that of tin,{{sfn|Lide|2005|p=10-179}} contrary to what [[periodic trends]] would predict. This is explained by [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which become significant in heavier atoms,{{sfn|Pyykk\\u00f6|1988|pp=563\\u2013594}} which contract s and p orbitals such that lead's 6s electrons have larger binding energies than its 5s electrons.{{sfn|Claudio|Godwin|Magyar|2002|pp=1\\u2013144}} A consequence is the so-called [[inert pair effect]]: the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding, stabilising the +2 [[oxidation state]] and making the distance between nearest atoms in [[crystalline]] lead unusually long.{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=36}}\\n\\nLead's lighter carbon group [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] form stable or metastable [[allotrope]]s with the tetrahedrally coordinated and [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] [[diamond cubic]] structure. The energy levels of their outer [[s-orbital|s-]] and [[p-orbital]]s are close enough to allow mixing into four [[orbital hybridisation|hybrid]] sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|pp=226\\u2013227, 374}} Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms [[metallic bonding|metallic bonds]] in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions. Lead consequently has a [[cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] structure{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=867}} like the similarly sized{{sfn|Slater|1964}} [[divalent]] metals [[calcium]] and [[strontium]].{{sfn|Considine|Considine|2013|pp=501, 2970}}{{efn|The tetrahedral allotrope of tin is called \\u03b1- or gray tin and is stable only at or below 13.2&nbsp;\\u00b0C (55.8&nbsp;\\u00b0F). The stable form of tin above this temperature is called \\u03b2- or white tin and has a distorted face centered cubic (tetragonal) structure which can be derived by compressing the tetrahedra of gray tin along their cubic axes. White tin effectively has a structure intermediate between the regular tetrahedral structure of gray tin, and the regular face centered cubic structure of lead, consistent with the general trend of increasing metallic character going down any representative group.{{sfn|Parth\\u00e9|1964|p=13}}}}{{efn|A [[quasicrystal]]line [[thin-film]] allotrope of lead, with pentagonal symmetry, was reported in 2013.

The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. The inert pair effect is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity, such as carbon in organolead compounds. In these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization is still energetically favorable.

Typically they are removed in a series of [[Pyrometallurgy|pyrometallurgical processes]]. The melt is treated in a [[reverberatory furnace]] with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the impurities except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float to the [[dross|top of the melt]] and are skimmed off.{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=25}}{{sfn|Primary Lead Refining}} Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the [[Parkes process]], in which zinc is added to lead.

Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of lead [[fluorosilicate]] (PbSiF<sub>6</sub>). Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution.{{sfn|Primary Lead Refining}}{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=34}} This is a high-cost process and thus mostly reserved for refining bullion containing high percentages of impurities.{{sfn|Davidson|Ryman|Sutherland|Milner|2014|p=23}}\\n\\n==== Direct process ====\\nIn this process, lead bullion and [[slag]] is obtained directly from lead concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming lead monoxide.

It does so by binding to the [[sulfhydryl group]]s found on many enzymes,{{sfn|Rudolph|Rudolph|Hostetter|Lister|2003|p=369}} or mimicking and displacing other metals which act as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] in many enzymatic reactions.{{sfn|Dart|Hurlbut|Boyer-Hassen|2004|p=1426}} The essential metals that lead interacts with include calcium, iron, and zinc.{{sfn|Kosnett|2006|p=238}} High levels of calcium and iron tend to provide some protection from lead poisoning; low levels cause increased susceptibility.{{sfn|Luckey|Venugopal|1979|pp=177\\u2013178}}\\n\\n=== Effects ===\\nLead can cause severe damage to the brain and kidneys and, ultimately, death. By mimicking calcium, lead can cross the [[blood\\u2013brain barrier]]. It degrades the [[myelin]] sheaths of [[neuron]]s, reduces their numbers, interferes with [[neurotransmitter|neurotransmission]] routes, and decreases neuronal growth.{{sfn|Rudolph|Rudolph|Hostetter|Lister|2003|p=369}} In the human body, lead inhibits [[porphobilinogen synthase]] and [[ferrochelatase]], preventing both [[porphobilinogen]] formation and the incorporation of iron into [[protoporphyrin IX]], the final step in [[heme]] synthesis. This causes ineffective heme synthesis and [[microcytic anemia]].{{sfn|Cohen|Trotzky|Pincus|1981|pp=904\\u2013906}}\\n<!--At lower levels, it acts as a calcium analog, interfering with ion channels during nerve conduction.

Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body; for ingestion, the rate is 20\\u201370%, with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults.{{sfn|Tarrag\\u00f3|2012|p=16}}\\n\\nPoisoning typically results from ingestion of food or water contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint.{{sfn|Toxicological Profile for Lead|2007|p=4}} Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters.{{sfn|Bremner|2002|p=101}} Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, [[lead paint]], and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.{{sfn|Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|2007}}\\n\\nThe use of lead for water pipes is [[plumbosolvency|a problem in areas with soft or acidic water]].{{sfn|Thornton|Rautiu|Brush|2001|p=17}} Hard water forms insoluble protective layers on the inner surface of the pipes, whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes.{{sfn|Moore|1977|pp=109\\u2013115}} Dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] in the carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead [[bicarbonate]]; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as [[lead(II) hydroxide]]. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The [[hard water|harder the water]] the more [[calcium bicarbonate]] and [[calcium sulfate|sulfate]] it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.{{sfn|Wiberg|Wiberg|Holleman|2001|p=914}}\\n\\n[[File:Kymographic recording of the effect of lead on frog heart..jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Kymograph]]ic recording of the effect of lead acetate on frog heart experimental set up]]\\n\\nIngestion of applied lead-based paint is the major source of exposure for children:\\na direct source is chewing on old painted window sills.

It is one of [[Supermarionation#List of Anderson Supermarionation productions|several Anderson series]] that were filmed using a form of electronic [[marionette]] puppetry dubbed \\\"[[Supermarionation]]\\\" combined with [[scale model]] special effects sequences. Running to thirty-two 25-minute episodes, it was first broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] regional franchises between 1967 and 1968 and has since been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\\n\\nSet in 2068, ''Captain Scarlet'' follows the \\\"[[Wikt:war of nerves|war of nerves]]\\\" between Earth and the [[Mysteron]]s, a race of [[Martian]]s who possess partial control over matter. When a misunderstanding causes human astronauts to attack their city on Mars, the Mysterons vow revenge and launch reprisals against Earth. These are countered by Spectrum, a worldwide security organisation. In the first episode, Spectrum agent [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] acquires the Mysterons' self-healing power of \\\"retrometabolism\\\" and is thus rendered \\\"indestructible\\\", being able to recover from otherwise fatal injuries. In this way, Scarlet becomes Spectrum's top asset in its fight against the Mysterons.\\n\\n''Captain Scarlet'', the eighth of the Andersons' ten puppet series, was preceded by ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and followed by ''[[Joe 90]]'' and ''[[The Secret Service]]''. In terms of visual aesthetic, it represents a departure from ''Thunderbirds'' in its use of non-caricatured puppets sculpted to realistic body proportions. Repeated several times in the UK, it has generated tie-ins from [[toy car]]s and [[action figure]]s to [[audio play]]s and original novels, as well as strips in the weekly children's comic ''[[TV Century 21]]''.\\n\\nCompared to ''Thunderbirds'', ''Stingray'', and earlier Anderson productions, ''Captain Scarlet'' is generally considered \\\"darker\\\" in tone and less suited to child audiences due to its violent content and themes of alien aggression and interplanetary war.<ref name=\\\"Cambridge\\\" /><ref name=\\\"RadioTimes\\\"/><ref name=\\\"DVDReview\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Decider\\\"/> The change in puppet design has divided opinion, while the wisdom of making the protagonist \\\"indestructible\\\" has also been questioned.<ref name=\\\"CrimeTV\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Archer and Hearn, 151\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Sangster&Condon\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Peel\\\">{{cite book|last1=Peel|first1=John|author1-link=John Peel (writer)|title=Thunderbirds, Stingray, Captain Scarlet: The Authorised Programme Guide|year=1993|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-86369-728-9|pages=244\\u2013246}}</ref> However, the series has been praised for its use of a multinational, multi-ethnic puppet cast and depiction of a [[utopia]]n future Earth.<ref name=\\\"Bould2008\\\">{{cite book |last1=Bould |first1=Mark |title=The Essential Science Fiction Television Reader |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8131-2492-6 |editor1-last=Telotte |editor1-first=J.P |editor-link=Jay Telotte |location=Lexington, Kentucky |pages=219\\u2013220 |chapter=Science Fiction Television in the United Kingdom}}</ref><ref name=\\\"WomenInSpace\\\" /> A computer-animated [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], ''[[New Captain Scarlet]]'', was first broadcast in 2005.\\n\\n{{TOC limit|3}}\\n\\n==Plot==\\n{{Main|List of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episodes}}\\n\\nThe series begins in 2068.

The smaller heads made close-up shots difficult to obtain and because most of the wires were head{{nbh}}mounted, significantly reduced the puppeteers' level of control, with the result that head movements and other actions became jerkier.<ref>La Rivi\\u00e8re 2014, pp.&nbsp;264\\u2013265.</ref> To reduce the amount of movement required, characters were frequently shown standing on moving walkways or sitting at moving desks: for example, Lieutenant Green operates the Cloudbase computer from a sliding chair and Colonel White's desk rotates. Puppeteer Jan King commented:\\n\\n{{Blockquote|The ''Captain Scarlet'' puppets were not built to walk. They were too heavy and not weighted properly anyway&nbsp;...

logo.png|thumb|The Spectrum logo appears at the start and the end of each episode's advert break.]]\\n\\nAll episodes, except the first, incorporate two title sequences. The first of these, incorporating the [[title card]] and principal production credits, is set in a run-down alleyway and presented from the point of view of an unseen gunman; turning a corner, he comes face to face with Captain Scarlet and opens fire, only to be shot dead by a single round from the captain's handgun. The words \\\"Captain Scarlet\\\" appear letter by letter in time with the seven strikes of the series' signature drumbeat composed by Barry Gray. This sequence is intended to demonstrate Scarlet's indestructibility, the bullets from the assassin's machine gun having no effect on the captain.<ref name=\\\"Drake and Bassett, 244\\\">Drake and Bassett, p.&nbsp;244.</ref>\\n\\nThe sequence is accompanied by a voiceover from [[Ed Bishop]] that states:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\\"The Mysterons: sworn enemies of Earth. Possessing the ability to recreate an exact likeness of an object or person. But first, they must destroy... Leading the fight, one man fate has made indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet.\\\"}}\\n\\nA number of variations have been used. In the first episode, the voiceover runs:<ref group=\\\"E\\\" name=\\\"The Mysterons\\\" />\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\\"The finger is on the trigger. About to unleash a force with terrible powers, beyond the comprehension of man. This force we shall know as the Mysterons. This man will be our hero, for fate will make him indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet.\\\"}}\\n\\nAn alternative version, rarely used, runs: \\\"One man. A man who is different. Chosen by fate. Caught up in Earth's unwanted conflict with the Mysterons. Determined. Courageous. Indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Lesterdemon\\\">{{cite magazine|last1=Pixley |first1=Andrew |author2=Michael Richardson, Alice Hendry |year=1985 |title=Supermarionation: the UK Broadcasts |magazine=Supermarionation is Go! |issue=14\\u201315 |publisher=Super M Productions |url=http://lester.demon.nl/superm/broadcastsUK.html |access-date=6 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724150956/http://lester.demon.nl/superm/broadcastsUK.html |archive-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Later prints feature an additional voiceover by [[Donald Gray]], warning the audience: \\\"Captain Scarlet is indestructible.

[[NASA]], the mission's operator, described it as a \\\"dress rehearsal\\\" for the first [[Moon landing]] ([[Apollo 11]], two months later{{sfn|Press Kit|p=1}}).<!-- The source is only for NASA's description of Apollo 10 as a dress rehearsal --> It was designated an [[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|\\\"F\\\"{{nbsp}}mission]], intended to test all [[spacecraft]] components and procedures short of actual descent and landing.\\n\\nAfter the spacecraft reached lunar orbit, astronaut [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] remained in the [[Apollo Command and Service Module|Command and Service Module]] (CSM) while astronauts [[Thomas P. Stafford|Thomas Stafford]] and [[Gene Cernan]] flew the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) to within {{convert|7.8|nmi|km|sp=us|order=flip}} of the [[lunar surface]], the point at which powered descent for landing would begin on a landing mission. After four orbits they rejoined Young in the CSM and, after the CSM completed its 31st orbit of the Moon, they returned safely to Earth.\\n\\nWhile NASA had considered attempting the first crewed lunar landing on Apollo 10, mission planners ultimately decided that it would be prudent to have a practice flight to hone the procedures and techniques. The crew encountered some problems during the flight: [[pogo oscillations]] during the launch phase and a brief, uncontrolled tumble of the LM ascent stage in lunar orbit during its solo flight. However, the mission accomplished its major objectives. Stafford and Cernan observed and photographed Apollo 11's planned landing site in the [[Sea of Tranquility]]. Apollo 10 spent 61 hours and 37 minutes orbiting the Moon, for about eight hours of which Stafford and Cernan flew the LM apart from Young in the CSM, and about eight days total in space. Additionally, Apollo 10 set the record for the highest speed attained by a crewed vehicle: 39,897&nbsp;km/h (11.08&nbsp;km/s or 24,791&nbsp;mph) on May 26, 1969, during the return from the Moon.\\n\\nThe mission's [[call sign]]s were the names of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' characters [[Charlie Brown]] for the CSM and [[Snoopy]] for the LM, who became Apollo 10's semi-official mascots.<ref>{{cite web |date=May 28, 1969 |title=Replicas of Snoopy and Charlie Brown decorate top of console in MCC |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010619231200/http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.jpg |archive-date=June 19, 2001 |access-date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=[[NASA]] |id=NASA Photo ID: S69-34314}} Photo description available [http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.htm here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005150651/https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.htm|date=October 5, 2021}}.</ref> ''Peanuts'' creator [[Charles Schulz]] also drew mission-related artwork for NASA.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McKinnon |first1=Mika |title=Snoopy the Astrobeagle, NASA's Mascot for Safety |url=https://gizmodo.com/snoopy-the-astrobeagle-nasas-mascot-for-safety-1570066950 |website=[[Gizmodo]] |date=April 30, 2014 |access-date=6 June 2019}}</ref>\\n\\n==Framework==\\n\\n=== Background ===\\n{{for|a fuller overview of this subject|Apollo program}}\\n\\nBy 1967, NASA had devised a [[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|list of mission types]], designated by letters, that needed to be flown before a landing attempt, which would be the \\\"G\\\" mission. The early uncrewed flights were considered \\\"A\\\" or \\\"B\\\" missions, while [[Apollo 7]], the crewed-flight test of the [[Apollo Command and Service Module|Command and Service Module]] (CSM), was the \\\"C\\\" mission. The first crewed orbital test of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) was accomplished on [[Apollo 9]], the \\\"D\\\" mission. [[Apollo 8]], flown to the Moon's orbit without an LM, was considered a \\\"C-prime\\\" mission, but its success gave NASA the confidence to skip the \\\"E\\\" mission, which would have tested the full Apollo spacecraft in medium or high Earth orbit. Apollo 10, the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing, was to be the \\\"F\\\" mission.<ref name = \\\"drew\\\" />{{sfn|Brooks|pp=234\\u2013235}}\\n\\nNASA considered skipping the \\\"F\\\" mission as well and attempting the first lunar landing on Apollo 10. Some with the agency advocated this, feeling it senseless to bring astronauts so close to the lunar surface, only to turn away. Although the lunar module intended for Apollo 10 was too heavy to perform the lunar mission, the one intended for [[Apollo 11]] could be substituted by delaying Apollo 10 a month from its May 1969 planned launch.{{sfn|Chaikin|pp=151\\u2013152}} NASA official [[George Mueller (engineer)|George Mueller]] favored a landing attempt on {{nowrap|Apollo 10}}; he was known for his aggressive approach to moving the [[Apollo program]] forward.<ref name = \\\"Hamish\\\">{{cite web|last=Lindsay|first=Hamish|publisher=Colin Hackellar|title=Apollo 10|url=https://honeysucklecreek.net/msfn_missions/Apollo_10_mission/hl_apollo10.html|access-date=July 2, 2022}}</ref> However, Director of Flight Operations [[Christopher C.

Lieutenant General [[Samuel C.

It is one of [[Supermarionation#List of Anderson Supermarionation productions|several Anderson series]] that were filmed using a form of electronic [[marionette]] puppetry dubbed \\\"[[Supermarionation]]\\\" combined with [[scale model]] special effects sequences. Running to thirty-two 25-minute episodes, it was first broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] regional franchises between 1967 and 1968 and has since been transmitted in more than 40 other countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\\n\\nSet in 2068, ''Captain Scarlet'' follows the \\\"[[Wikt:war of nerves|war of nerves]]\\\" between Earth and the [[Mysteron]]s, a race of [[Martian]]s who possess partial control over matter. When a misunderstanding causes human astronauts to attack their city on Mars, the Mysterons vow revenge and launch reprisals against Earth. These are countered by Spectrum, a worldwide security organisation. In the first episode, Spectrum agent [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] acquires the Mysterons' self-healing power of \\\"retrometabolism\\\" and is thus rendered \\\"indestructible\\\", being able to recover from otherwise fatal injuries. In this way, Scarlet becomes Spectrum's top asset in its fight against the Mysterons.\\n\\n''Captain Scarlet'', the eighth of the Andersons' ten puppet series, was preceded by ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and followed by ''[[Joe 90]]'' and ''[[The Secret Service]]''. In terms of visual aesthetic, it represents a departure from ''Thunderbirds'' in its use of non-caricatured puppets sculpted to realistic body proportions. Repeated several times in the UK, it has generated tie-ins from [[toy car]]s and [[action figure]]s to [[audio play]]s and original novels, as well as strips in the weekly children's comic ''[[TV Century 21]]''.\\n\\nCompared to ''Thunderbirds'', ''Stingray'', and earlier Anderson productions, ''Captain Scarlet'' is generally considered \\\"darker\\\" in tone and less suited to child audiences due to its violent content and themes of alien aggression and interplanetary war.<ref name=\\\"Cambridge\\\" /><ref name=\\\"RadioTimes\\\"/><ref name=\\\"DVDReview\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Decider\\\"/> The change in puppet design has divided opinion, while the wisdom of making the protagonist \\\"indestructible\\\" has also been questioned.<ref name=\\\"CrimeTV\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Archer and Hearn, 151\\\" /><ref name=\\\"Sangster&Condon\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Peel\\\">{{cite book|last1=Peel|first1=John|author1-link=John Peel (writer)|title=Thunderbirds, Stingray, Captain Scarlet: The Authorised Programme Guide|year=1993|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-86369-728-9|pages=244\\u2013246}}</ref> However, the series has been praised for its use of a multinational, multi-ethnic puppet cast and depiction of a [[utopia]]n future Earth.<ref name=\\\"Bould2008\\\">{{cite book |last1=Bould |first1=Mark |title=The Essential Science Fiction Television Reader |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8131-2492-6 |editor1-last=Telotte |editor1-first=J.P |editor-link=Jay Telotte |location=Lexington, Kentucky |pages=219\\u2013220 |chapter=Science Fiction Television in the United Kingdom}}</ref><ref name=\\\"WomenInSpace\\\" /> A computer-animated [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], ''[[New Captain Scarlet]]'', was first broadcast in 2005.\\n\\n{{TOC limit|3}}\\n\\n==Plot==\\n{{Main|List of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episodes}}\\n\\nThe series begins in 2068.

In all Anderson series prior to ''Captain Scarlet'', the puppets' heads had been disproportionately large compared to the rest of their bodies as the cranium contained the [[solenoid]] that powered the automatic mouth movements. Scaling up the bodies to match the heads was not possible, as the puppets would have become too heavy to operate and there was not enough studio space to enlarge all of the sets.<ref name=\\\"Archer and Hearn, 151\\\">Archer and Hearn, p.&nbsp;151.</ref><ref>La Rivi\\u00e8re 2009, p.&nbsp;150.</ref><ref>Bentley 2017, p.&nbsp;49.</ref> This gave the puppets a caricatured look that frustrated Gerry Anderson, who wanted their design to reflect natural [[Body proportions|anatomical proportions]].<ref name=\\\"Archer and Hearn, 151\\\" /> Before ''Captain Scarlet'' entered production, [[Reg Hill]] and associate producer [[John Read (producer)|John Read]] created a new type of puppet with the solenoid built into the chest, thus enabling the heads to be reduced to a realistic size.<ref name = \\\"Drake and Bassett, 203\\\">Drake and Bassett, p.&nbsp;203.</ref><ref>La Rivi\\u00e8re 2009, p.&nbsp;151.</ref>\\n\\nAfter being sculpted in [[Plasticine]], the puppet heads were moulded on a [[silicone rubber]] base and finished in [[fibreglass]].

The smaller heads made close-up shots difficult to obtain and because most of the wires were head{{nbh}}mounted, significantly reduced the puppeteers' level of control, with the result that head movements and other actions became jerkier.<ref>La Rivi\\u00e8re 2014, pp.&nbsp;264\\u2013265.</ref> To reduce the amount of movement required, characters were frequently shown standing on moving walkways or sitting at moving desks: for example, Lieutenant Green operates the Cloudbase computer from a sliding chair and Colonel White's desk rotates. Puppeteer Jan King commented:\\n\\n{{Blockquote|The ''Captain Scarlet'' puppets were not built to walk. They were too heavy and not weighted properly anyway&nbsp;...

logo.png|thumb|The Spectrum logo appears at the start and the end of each episode's advert break.]]\\n\\nAll episodes, except the first, incorporate two title sequences. The first of these, incorporating the [[title card]] and principal production credits, is set in a run-down alleyway and presented from the point of view of an unseen gunman; turning a corner, he comes face to face with Captain Scarlet and opens fire, only to be shot dead by a single round from the captain's handgun. The words \\\"Captain Scarlet\\\" appear letter by letter in time with the seven strikes of the series' signature drumbeat composed by Barry Gray. This sequence is intended to demonstrate Scarlet's indestructibility, the bullets from the assassin's machine gun having no effect on the captain.<ref name=\\\"Drake and Bassett, 244\\\">Drake and Bassett, p.&nbsp;244.</ref>\\n\\nThe sequence is accompanied by a voiceover from [[Ed Bishop]] that states:\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\\"The Mysterons: sworn enemies of Earth. Possessing the ability to recreate an exact likeness of an object or person. But first, they must destroy... Leading the fight, one man fate has made indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet.\\\"}}\\n\\nA number of variations have been used. In the first episode, the voiceover runs:<ref group=\\\"E\\\" name=\\\"The Mysterons\\\" />\\n\\n{{blockquote|\\\"The finger is on the trigger. About to unleash a force with terrible powers, beyond the comprehension of man. This force we shall know as the Mysterons. This man will be our hero, for fate will make him indestructible. His name: Captain Scarlet.\\\"}}\\n\\nAn alternative version, rarely used, runs: \\\"One man. A man who is different. Chosen by fate. Caught up in Earth's unwanted conflict with the Mysterons.

Elements of the new series, including Captain Black, had been introduced as early as June 1967.

The first, ''The Mark of the Mysterons'', bore little relation to ''Captain Scarlet'' besides featuring the Mysterons as villains; it was set in the 1960s and the presentation was similar to that of ''[[The Invaders]]''.

After four orbits they rejoined Young in the CSM and, after the CSM completed its 31st orbit of the Moon, they returned safely to Earth.\\n\\nWhile NASA had considered attempting the first crewed lunar landing on Apollo 10, mission planners ultimately decided that it would be prudent to have a practice flight to hone the procedures and techniques. The crew encountered some problems during the flight: [[pogo oscillations]] during the launch phase and a brief, uncontrolled tumble of the LM ascent stage in lunar orbit during its solo flight. However, the mission accomplished its major objectives. Stafford and Cernan observed and photographed Apollo 11's planned landing site in the [[Sea of Tranquility]]. Apollo 10 spent 61 hours and 37 minutes orbiting the Moon, for about eight hours of which Stafford and Cernan flew the LM apart from Young in the CSM, and about eight days total in space. Additionally, Apollo 10 set the record for the highest speed attained by a crewed vehicle: 39,897&nbsp;km/h (11.08&nbsp;km/s or 24,791&nbsp;mph) on May 26, 1969, during the return from the Moon.\\n\\nThe mission's [[call sign]]s were the names of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' characters [[Charlie Brown]] for the CSM and [[Snoopy]] for the LM, who became Apollo 10's semi-official mascots.<ref>{{cite web |date=May 28, 1969 |title=Replicas of Snoopy and Charlie Brown decorate top of console in MCC |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010619231200/http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.jpg |archive-date=June 19, 2001 |access-date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=[[NASA]] |id=NASA Photo ID: S69-34314}} Photo description available [http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.htm here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005150651/https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.htm|date=October 5, 2021}}.</ref> ''Peanuts'' creator [[Charles Schulz]] also drew mission-related artwork for NASA.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McKinnon |first1=Mika |title=Snoopy the Astrobeagle, NASA's Mascot for Safety |url=https://gizmodo.com/snoopy-the-astrobeagle-nasas-mascot-for-safety-1570066950 |website=[[Gizmodo]] |date=April 30, 2014 |access-date=6 June 2019}}</ref>\\n\\n==Framework==\\n\\n=== Background ===\\n{{for|a fuller overview of this subject|Apollo program}}\\n\\nBy 1967, NASA had devised a [[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|list of mission types]], designated by letters, that needed to be flown before a landing attempt, which would be the \\\"G\\\" mission.

ALS-2 was chosen as the lunar landing site since it was relatively smooth, of scientific interest, and ALS-1 was deemed too far to the east.{{sfn|Wilhelms|pp=189\\u2013192}} Thus, when Apollo 10's launch date was announced on January 10, 1969, it was shifted from its placeholder date of May 1 to May 17, rather than to May 16. On March 17, 1969, the launch was slipped one day to May 18, to allow for a better view of ALS-3, to the west of ALS-2.<ref name = \\\"drew\\\" /> Another deviation from the plans for Apollo 11 was that Apollo 10 was to spend an additional day in lunar orbit once the CSM and LM rendezvoused; this was to allow time for additional testing of the LM's systems, as well as for photography of possible future Apollo landing sites.{{sfn|Press Kit|pp=6, 8}}\\n\\nThe Apollo 10 astronauts undertook five hours of formal training for each hour of the mission's eight-day duration. This was in addition to the normal mission preparations such as technical briefings, pilot meetings and study. They took part in the testing of the CSM at the [[Downey, California|Downey]], California, facility of its manufacturer, [[North American Rockwell]], and of the LM at [[Grumman]] in [[Bethpage, New York|Bethpage]], New York. They visited [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, for briefings on the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] at the [[MIT Instrumentation Lab|Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentation Laboratory]].

It is native to the [[southwestern United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]] islands of [[Trinidad]] and [[Margarita Island|Margarita]]. [[Carl Linnaeus]] [[scientific description|scientifically described]] it in 1758. Two [[subspecies]] are recognized.\\n\\nThe ocelot is efficient at climbing, leaping and swimming. It prefers areas close to water sources with dense vegetation cover and high prey availability. It preys on small terrestrial mammals, such as [[armadillo]]s, [[opossum]]s, and [[lagomorph]]s. It is typically active during [[twilight]] and at night and tends to be solitary and [[Territory (animal)|territorial]]. Both sexes become [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] at around two years of age and can breed throughout the year; peak mating season varies geographically. After a [[gestation]] period of two to three months, the female gives birth to a [[Litter (zoology)|litter]] of one to three kittens. They stay with their mother for up to two years, after which they leave to establish their own [[home range]]s.\\n\\nThe ocelot is listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] and is threatened by [[habitat destruction]], [[hunting]], and [[traffic]] accidents. While its range is very large, various populations are decreasing in many parts of its range.

They include animals such as [[cetacea]]ns ([[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s), [[pinniped]]s ([[earless seal|seals]], [[sea lion]]s and [[walrus]]es), [[sirenian]]s ([[manatee]]s and [[dugong]]s), [[sea otter]]s and [[polar bear]]s. They are an informal group, unified only by their reliance on marine environments for feeding and survival.\\n\\nMarine mammal adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Pinnipeds are semiaquatic; they spend the majority of their time in the water but need to return to land for important activities such as [[mating]], [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] and [[molting]]. Sea otters tend to live in kelp forests and estuaries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sea otter |url=https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/animals-a-to-z/sea-otter |access-date=2024-06-05 |website=montereybayaquarium.org}}</ref> In contrast, the polar bear is mostly terrestrial and only go into the water on occasions of necessity, and are thus much less adapted to aquatic living. The diets of marine mammals vary considerably as well; some eat [[zooplankton]], others eat fish, squid, shellfish, or seagrass, and a few eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.\\n\\nMarine mammals were first hunted by [[aboriginal whaling|aboriginal peoples]] for food and other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to a sharp decline in all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting led to the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]], [[sea mink]], [[Japanese sea lion]] and [[Caribbean monk seal]]. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the [[gray whale]] and [[northern elephant seal]], have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the [[North Atlantic right whale]], are [[critically endangered]]. Other than being hunted, marine mammals can be killed as [[bycatch]] from fisheries, where for example they can become entangled in nets and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. [[Habitat degradation]] also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food.

The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they would not be able to discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins) and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the [[Gulf War]] and [[Vietnam War]]. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.<ref name=beastsofwar>{{cite book|url={{Google books| plainurl=yes|id=rDCKCgAAQBAJ|page=127}}|first=Jared|last=Eglan|year=2015|title=Beasts of War: The Militarization of Animals|publisher=Lulu.com|pages=126\\u2013128|isbn=978-1-329-51613-7}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}<ref name=kistler>{{cite book|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=g9Bj-kyDi9AC|page=313}}|first=John M.|last=Kistler|year=2011|title= Animals in the Military: From Hannibal's Elephants to the Dolphins of the U.S. Navy|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=313\\u2013321|isbn=978-1-59884-346-0|oclc=741119653}}</ref>\\n\\nThe use of marine mammals by the Navy, even in accordance with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for in accordance with accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of [[animal muzzle|muzzles]] and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.<ref name=beastsofwar/><ref name=kistler/>\\n\\n==See also==\\n{{Portal|Marine life|Mammals|Oceans}}\\n* [[Aquatic animal]]\\n* [[Marine mammal training]]\\n{{Clear}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==Further reading==\\n* {{cite encyclopedia |editor1-last=W\\u00fcrsig |editor1-first=Bernd |editor2-last=Thewissen |editor2-first=J.G.M. |editor3-last=Kovacs |editor3-first=Kit M. |title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals |date=2018 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=9780128043271 |edition=Third}}\\n\\n* Berta, Annalisa.

Please check the word count before making any additions. Please discuss any major changes on the talk page. -->In 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like [[house spirits]] called ''[[susuwatari]]'', that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones.<ref group=note>The spirits are called \\\"black soots\\\" in early subtitles and \\\"soot sprites\\\" in the later English-dubbed versions.</ref> The ''susuwatari'' leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as \\\"Totoro\\\". Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book ''[[Three Billy Goats Gruff]]''. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.\\n\\n{{Multiple image\\n| align             = right\\n| image1            =Expo 2005 of Satsuki and Mei\\u2019s House 01.jpg\\n| caption1          = {{ill|Satsuki and Mei's house|ja|\\u30b5\\u30c4\\u30ad\\u3068\\u30e1\\u30a4\\u306e\\u5bb6}} at the [[Expo 2005]] site\\n| image2            = Satsuki and Mei's House 01.JPG\\n| caption2          = Closeup view of Satsuki and Mei's house\\n| direction         = vertical\\n}}\\n\\nThe girls wait for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A [[Catbus|giant, bus-shaped cat]] arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a [[ceremonial dance]] around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying [[Spinning top|top]]. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.\\n\\nThe girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro's help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei's location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital, where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.\\n\\nEventually, their mother returns home and the girls play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch from afar.\\n\\n== Themes ==\\n{{Expand section |date=September 2023}}\\n\\n[[Animism]] is a major theme in ''My Neighbor Totoro'', according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck.<ref name=\\\":1\\\">{{Cite book|last=Ogihara-Schuck|first=Eriko|title=Miyazaki's Animism Abroad: The Reception of Japanese Religious Themes by American and German Audiences|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4766-1395-6|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=81\\u201383}}</ref> Totoro has animistic traits and has {{lang|ja-latn|[[kami]]}} status because he lives in a camphor tree in a [[Shinto]] shrine surrounded by a [[Shinto rope]], and he is referred to as {{lang|ja-latn|mori no nushi}} (master of the forest).<ref name=\\\":1\\\" /> Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro, her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro.

The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by [[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm Bischoff|Bischoff]], [[Christoph Theodor Aeby|Aeby]], and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.}}</ref> I absolutely know of none.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[fictional world]] of [[Middle-earth]], representing both a homely place of sanctuary and a magical [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] otherworld. It is an important location in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', being the place where the quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] began.\\n\\nRivendell's feeling of peace may have contributed to the popularity of ''The Lord of the Rings'' during the war-troubled 1960s. Scholars have noted that Rivendell was the home of Elvish song, from the [[hymn]] to [[Elbereth]], recalling [[Christianity in Middle-earth|Tolkien's Catholicism]], to the complex [[Song of E\\u00e4rendil]] with its [[Poetry in The Lord of the Rings|multiple poetic devices]]. Others have written that it resembles the [[Celtic Otherworld]] of [[T\\u00edr na n\\u00d3g]]; and that it physically recalls the valley of [[Lauterbrunnen]] in Switzerland where Tolkien had gone hiking in 1911.\\n\\n==Etymology==\\n''Rivendell'' is a direct translation or [[calque]] into English of the [[Sindarin]] '''Imladris''', both meaning \\\"deep valley\\\". The name Rivendell is formed by two English elements: \\\"riven\\\" (split, cloven) and \\\"dell\\\" (valley). Imladris was also rendered \\\"''Karningul''\\\" in [[Westron]], the \\\"Common Tongue\\\" of Middle-earth represented as English in the text of ''The Lord of the Rings.'' The house of Elrond in Rivendell is also called ''The Last Homely House East of the Sea,'' alluding to the wilderness ([[Rhovanion]]) that lies east of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1955|loc=Appendix F, \\\"On Translation\\\"}}</ref>\\n\\n== Fiction ==\\n\\n{{Sketch Map of Middle-earth|upright=2.5|center|caption=[[Image map]] with clickable links of the north-west of [[Middle-earth]] at the end of the [[Third Age]], showing Rivendell just West of the Misty Mountains (top centre) by the River Bruinen.

Contrary to the map of western Middle-earth published in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the Great East Road did not, in Tolkien's view, lead through Rivendell: Rivendell was maintained as a hidden valley away from the road to the High Pass.<ref name=\\\"A Short Rest\\\" group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1937|loc=ch 3 \\\"A Short Rest\\\"}}</ref><ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1937|loc=ch. 18 \\\"The Return Journey\\\"}}</ref><ref name=\\\"The Last Stage\\\" group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1937|loc=ch. 19 \\\"The Last Stage\\\"}}</ref> Like [[Hobbiton]], it is at about the same latitude as Tolkien's workplace, [[Oxford]].<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2023|loc=#294 to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 8 February 1967 }}</ref>\\n\\n=== History ===\\n\\nRivendell was founded in the [[Second Age]] after the dark lord [[Sauron]]'s destruction of the Elvish land of [[Eregion]]. Rivendell remained as the only Elven settlement in eastern Eriador; [[Gil-galad]] gave Elrond the Ring [[Vilya (Middle-earth)|Vilya]], providing him with the power to protect Rivendell and slow the passage of time in its hidden valley: indeed, Rivendell kept its own calendar.<ref name=\\\"Calendars\\\" group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1955|loc=Appendix D, \\\"The Calendars\\\"}}</ref><ref name=\\\"Galadriel and Celeborn\\\" group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1980|loc=part 2, \\\"The Second Age\\\" ch. 4 \\\"The History of Galadriel and Celeborn\\\", \\\"Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn\\\"}}</ref><ref name=\\\"Many Meetings\\\" group=T/> Rivendell survived repeated attacks in the [[Third Age]] by the armies of the [[Witch-king of Angmar]].{{sfn|Dickerson|2013|pp=573\\u2013574}}<ref name=\\\"Galadriel and Celeborn\\\" group=T/> Rivendell held the heirlooms of the [[Rangers of the North]] from the lost kingdom of [[Arnor (Middle-earth)|Arnor]], including the shards of [[Elendil]]'s sword [[Narsil]], the Sceptre of Ann\\u00faminas, and the Star of Elendil. Elrond fostered the children of the heirs to Arnor's throne, the last being [[Aragorn]]. While in Rivendell, Aragorn met and fell in love with Elrond's daughter, [[Arwen]].

Tolkien stated directly that \\\"From Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains, the journey ... including the [[Glissade (climbing)|glissade]] [of Bilbo and the Dwarves] down the [[scree|slithering stones]] into the pine woods ... is based on my adventures in Switzerland in 1911\\\".<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2023|loc=#306 to [[Michael Tolkien]], 1967-8 }}</ref><ref name=\\\"MacEacharan 2014\\\">{{cite web |last=MacEacheran |first=Mike |title=In Alpine villages, Hobbits lurk |date=24 May 2014 |publisher=[[BBC]] |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20140523-in-alpine-villages-hobbits-lurk |access-date=18 August 2020}}</ref>\\n\\nThe medievalist [[Marjorie Burns]] writes that Bilbo's approach to Rivendell parallels the early fantasy writer and translator of Norse legend [[William Morris]]'s approach through the wilds of Iceland to a place he called \\\"Water-dale\\\" (''Vatnsdale''); both ride across uplands dotted with patches of green, becoming extremely tired; both then cross narrow ravines, and bogs; and both arrive at a hidden valley that offers shelter and comfort. In another place, Morris crosses a \\\"narrow, bridge-like rock\\\", just as Bilbo faces a \\\"narrow bridge of stone without a parapet\\\" on entering Rivendell.{{sfn|Burns|2005|pp=81\\u201384}}\\n\\n=== A place of sanctuary ===\\n{{further|Tolkien and the Celtic|Lothl\\u00f3rien#Analysis}}\\n\\n[[File:15 They rode up to a stately palace.jpg|thumb|upright|Rivendell has been compared to the [[Celtic Otherworld]],{{sfn|Burns|2005|p=54}} here in a 1910 illustration by [[Stephen Reid (artist)|Stephen Reid]]]]\\n\\n[[Matthew T.

She compares the [[military-industrial complex]] with [[Mordor]], and suggests that they yearned for a place of peace, just as Frodo Baggins felt an \\\"overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace\\u2026 in Rivendell\\\".<ref name=\\\"Ciabattari 2014\\\"/>\\nBurns writes that Rivendell and the other Elvish realm of [[Lothl\\u00f3rien]] parallel the [[Celtic Otherworld]] (in Irish, [[T\\u00edr na n\\u00d3g]]), being hard to find, but if one is admitted and welcomed, one crosses a river, symbolising the spiritual transition from the ordinary realm, and \\\"the weary adventurer is transported into a haven of Elven hospitality and delight\\\".{{sfn|Burns|2005|p=54}} There are multiple markers of the transition:\\n\\n{{blockquote|To enter Rivendell is to leave, for a time, the uplands' bleak, mountainous, northerly terrain. First comes the steep descent ...; pines are replaced by beech and oak; the air grows warmer; the first of the elves greet them with laughter and song, and then comes the inevitable water crossing that divides the rest of Middle-earth from the inner core of every Elven realm.{{sfn|Burns|2005|p=61}}}}\\n\\nBurns notes that both \\\"Riven\\\" and \\\"dell\\\" suggest a low place into which one must descend; and that a descent is characteristic of Celtic tales of entry into [[Otherworld|the underground realm]] of the [[Tuatha D\\u00e9 Danann]], whose chiefs each rule a burial mound.{{sfn|Burns|2005|p=66}}\\n\\n=== Heroic quest's starting-point ===\\n\\n{{further|Christianity in Middle-earth}}\\n\\nThe philologist and Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] remarks that Tolkien, a [[Christianity|Christian]], was extremely careful with dates and timelines, but that hardly any readers notice that the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell on its [[quest]] on 25 December, the date of [[Christmas]], and succeeds, destroying the Ring and causing the fall of Sauron, on 25 March, the date in Anglo-Saxon tradition for the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]].{{sfn|Shippey|2005|p=227}}\\n\\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Verlyn Flieger]] writes that both Frodo and Aragorn receive their renewed [[Naming of weapons in Middle-earth|magic swords]] in Rivendell, [[Heroism in The Lord of the Rings#Magic sword|marking them out as heroes]] in the epic tradition of [[Sigurd]] and [[King Arthur|Arthur]], at the start of [[Quests in Middle-earth|their quest]].{{sfn|Flieger|2004|pp=122\\u2013145}}\\n\\n=== Cultural allusions ===\\n{{further|Poetry in The Lord of the Rings#Glimpses of another world}}\\n\\nShippey contrasts the versions of the ''[[The Old Walking Song|Old Walking Song]]'' sung by Bilbo and Frodo. Bilbo follows the \\\"Road ... with eager feet\\\", hoping to reach the peace of Rivendell, to retire and take his ease; whereas Frodo sings \\\"with weary feet\\\", hoping somehow to reach Mordor bearing the Ring, and to try to destroy it in the [[Cracks of Doom]]: diametrically opposed destinations and errands.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|p=213}} He notes that Rivendell was the home of Elvish song, and cites Tolkien's statement that the song that the Hobbits hear in Rivendell, ''[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]'' invoking the semi-divine [[Varda (Middle-earth)|Varda]], was a [[hymn]] [[Christianity in Middle-earth|suggestive of his own devout Catholicism]].{{sfn|Shippey|2005|p=230}} Shippey writes, too, that Tolkien had Bilbo write and sing the Song of [[Earendil]] in Rivendell, making use of [[Poetry in The Lord of the Rings#Song of E\\u00e4rendil|multiple poetic devices]] \\u2013 rhyme, internal half-rhyme, alliteration, alliterative assonance, and \\\"a frequent if irregular variation of syntax\\\" \\u2013 to create a mysterious Elvish effect of \\\"rich and continuous uncertainty, a pattern forever being glimpsed but never quite grasped.\\\"{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=218\\u2013219}} Rebecca Ankeny comments that Tolkien uses verse, too, to signal the horror of the Elves when Gandalf speaks the dark lord's [[rhyme of the Rings]] aloud, in the [[Black Speech]], threatening the end of Rivendell.<ref name=\\\"Ankeny 2005\\\">{{cite journal |last=Ankeny |first=Rebecca |title=Poem as Sign in 'The Lord of the Rings' |journal=[[Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts]] |volume=16 |issue=2 (62) |year=2005 |pages=86\\u201395 |jstor=43308763}}</ref>\\n\\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Gergely Nagy (scholar)|Gergely Nagy]] notes that Tolkien wanted to present the complex set of writings of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' as a seemingly-genuine collection of tales and myths within the frame of his fictional Middle-earth; he modified ''The Lord of the Rings'' to ascribe the documents to Bilbo, supposedly written in the years he spent in Rivendell, and preserved in the fictitious ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'', its name alluding to the ''[[Red Book of Hergest]]''.{{sfn|Nagy|2020|pp=107\\u2013118}}\\n\\nBurns writes that Rivendell, \\\"the Last Homely House\\\",<ref name=\\\"Many Meetings\\\" group=T/> offers a welcoming home, repeating the pattern set in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' of \\\"easy-going but tidy bachelor indulgence\\\" from Bilbo's [[Bag End]] hobbit-hole onwards; despite Arwen, there is hardly anything \\\"of the feminine\\\".{{sfn|Burns|2005|pp=136\\u2013137}} Shippey states that Frodo has \\\"to be dug out ... of no fewer than [[Frodo's five Homely Houses|five 'Homely Houses']]\\\", of which Rivendell is the last.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Shippey |title=[[J.

Please check the word count before making any additions. Please discuss any major changes on the talk page. -->In 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like [[house spirits]] called ''[[susuwatari]]'', that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones.<ref group=note>The spirits are called \\\"black soots\\\" in early subtitles and \\\"soot sprites\\\" in the later English-dubbed versions.</ref> The ''susuwatari'' leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as \\\"Totoro\\\". Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book ''[[Three Billy Goats Gruff]]''. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.\\n\\n{{Multiple image\\n| align             = right\\n| image1            =Expo 2005 of Satsuki and Mei\\u2019s House 01.jpg\\n| caption1          = {{ill|Satsuki and Mei's house|ja|\\u30b5\\u30c4\\u30ad\\u3068\\u30e1\\u30a4\\u306e\\u5bb6}} at the [[Expo 2005]] site\\n| image2            = Satsuki and Mei's House 01.JPG\\n| caption2          = Closeup view of Satsuki and Mei's house\\n| direction         = vertical\\n}}\\n\\nThe girls wait for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A [[Catbus|giant, bus-shaped cat]] arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a [[ceremonial dance]] around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying [[Spinning top|top]]. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.\\n\\nThe girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. Mei's disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro's help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei's location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital, where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.\\n\\nEventually, their mother returns home and the girls play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch from afar.\\n\\n== Themes ==\\n{{Expand section |date=September 2023}}\\n\\n[[Animism]] is a major theme in ''My Neighbor Totoro'', according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck.<ref name=\\\":1\\\">{{Cite book|last=Ogihara-Schuck|first=Eriko|title=Miyazaki's Animism Abroad: The Reception of Japanese Religious Themes by American and German Audiences|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4766-1395-6|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=81\\u201383}}</ref> Totoro has animistic traits and has {{lang|ja-latn|[[kami]]}} status because he lives in a camphor tree in a [[Shinto]] shrine surrounded by a [[Shinto rope]], and he is referred to as {{lang|ja-latn|mori no nushi}} (master of the forest).<ref name=\\\":1\\\" /> Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro, her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro.

The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by [[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm Bischoff|Bischoff]], [[Christoph Theodor Aeby|Aeby]], and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[fictional world]] of [[Middle-earth]], representing both a homely place of sanctuary and a magical [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elvish]] otherworld. It is an important location in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', being the place where the quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] began.\\n\\nRivendell's feeling of peace may have contributed to the popularity of ''The Lord of the Rings'' during the war-troubled 1960s. Scholars have noted that Rivendell was the home of Elvish song, from the [[hymn]] to [[Elbereth]], recalling [[Christianity in Middle-earth|Tolkien's Catholicism]], to the complex [[Song of E\\u00e4rendil]] with its [[Poetry in The Lord of the Rings|multiple poetic devices]]. Others have written that it resembles the [[Celtic Otherworld]] of [[T\\u00edr na n\\u00d3g]]; and that it physically recalls the valley of [[Lauterbrunnen]] in Switzerland where Tolkien had gone hiking in 1911.\\n\\n==Etymology==\\n''Rivendell'' is a direct translation or [[calque]] into English of the [[Sindarin]] '''Imladris''', both meaning \\\"deep valley\\\". The name Rivendell is formed by two English elements: \\\"riven\\\" (split, cloven) and \\\"dell\\\" (valley). Imladris was also rendered \\\"''Karningul''\\\" in [[Westron]], the \\\"Common Tongue\\\" of Middle-earth represented as English in the text of ''The Lord of the Rings.'' The house of Elrond in Rivendell is also called ''The Last Homely House East of the Sea,'' alluding to the wilderness ([[Rhovanion]]) that lies east of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref group=T>{{harvnb|Tolkien|1955|loc=Appendix F, \\\"On Translation\\\"}}</ref>\\n\\n== Fiction ==\\n\\n{{Sketch Map of Middle-earth|upright=2.5|center|caption=[[Image map]] with clickable links of the north-west of [[Middle-earth]] at the end of the [[Third Age]], showing Rivendell just West of the Misty Mountains (top centre) by the River Bruinen.

Renton's other friends, aggressive, alcoholic psychopath Francis \\\"Franco\\\" Begbie and honest footballer and recreational speed user Tommy Mackenzie, who both abstain from heroin, warn him about his dangerous drug habit. Growing tired of his reckless lifestyle, Renton attempts to wean himself off heroin with a bare room, foodstuffs, and [[opium]] [[Suppository|suppositories]] from ill-reputed dealer Mikey Forrester. He develops diarrhoea and has to relieve himself in the disgusting toilet of a [[betting shop]], then imagines himself swimming in the filthy water as he retrieves the suppositories.\\n\\nRenton attempts to lead a \\\"useful and fulfilling\\\" life away from heroin. This consists of him meeting Sick Boy in a park where he shoots a stranger's dog with an [[air gun]], supplying Spud with [[amphetamine]] for a job interview that turns disastrous, and stealing a sex tape of Tommy and his girlfriend, Lizzy. At [[The Volcano (nightclub)|The Volcano nightclub]], Renton notices that his cessation of heroin use has increased his [[libido]]. He seduces a girl named Diane Coulston, and they return to her apartment to have sex. The following morning, Renton is horrified to learn that she is below the [[age of consent]] and lives with her parents, whom Renton initially assumes are her flatmates. Diane threatens Renton with [[blackmail]] to report him to the police for [[statutory rape]] if he does not continue the relationship.\\n\\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to reintegrate into society, Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud [[relapse]] into heroin use; Tommy also begins to dabble in drug use after becoming depressed due to being dumped by Lizzy, thanks to the actions of an unknowing Renton. Despite the group\\u2019s shock, grief, and horror regarding the negligence-induced death of Dawn, the infant daughter of Sick Boy and his girlfriend Allison, the group still does not recover from their heroin use. Later, Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud are caught [[shoplifting]]; Renton and Spud are arrested while Sick Boy narrowly escapes. Spud receives a six-month custodial sentence at [[Edinburgh (HM Prison)|HMP Saughton]], and Renton narrowly avoids jail by entering a [[drug rehabilitation]] programme where he is given [[methadone]] to help him. However, Renton quickly relapses and nearly dies of a heroin [[Drug overdose|overdose]] at Swanney's home. Upon returning home after his revival at the hospital, Renton's parents lock him in his childhood bedroom and force him to go [[cold turkey]]. Following a horrific withdrawal punctuated by hallucinations of his friends and visions of Dawn crawling on the ceiling, Renton is released upon the condition of an [[HIV/AIDS]] test. Despite years of sharing syringes with other addicts, Renton tests negative.\\n\\nNow clean but bored and devoid of meaning in his life, Renton visits Tommy, who is now severely addicted to heroin and is HIV-positive. On Diane's advice, Renton moves to [[London]] and works as a property letting agent. He begins to enjoy his new life of sobriety in London and corresponds with Diane, who updates him on developments back home. To Renton's shock and frustration, Begbie, wanted for a failed [[armed robbery]], tracks him down and takes refuge in his apartment. Sick Boy, now trying to be a [[pimp]] and [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]], soon joins them. Begbie and Sick Boy later attack two of Renton's clientele (at a supposedly impossible-to-sell property where Renton has sent them to get them off his back), resulting in him losing his job. The trio returns to Edinburgh to avoid police attention and for the funeral of Tommy, who has died of AIDS-related [[toxoplasmosis]].\\n\\nFollowing the funeral, Sick Boy asks Renton, Begbie, and Spud (who has been recently released from prison) for help in buying two kilograms of pure heroin from Mikey Forrester (who got it after a drunken night out with two Russian sailors), for the low price of \\u00a34,000, to sell on, with Renton needing to supply the remaining \\u00a32,000 asking price. After Begbie threatens him, Renton reluctantly covers the remaining cost, and the group returns to London to sell the heroin to a dealer for \\u00a316,000. As they celebrate in a pub, Renton secretly suggests to Spud that they could leave with the money, but Spud, motivated by fear and loyalty, refuses. Sick Boy indicates he would happily do so, and Begbie brutally beats a man after a minor accident. Concluding that Begbie and Sick Boy are unpredictable and dangerous, Renton quietly steals the bag of money and leaves the following morning. Spud witnesses him but does not warn the others. Renton leaves \\u00a34,000 in a left-luggage locker for Spud, who \\\"never hurt anybody\\\". Begbie, discovering Renton and the money gone, enragedly destroys the hotel room where the four stayed, prompting the police to arrive and arrest him as Sick Boy and Spud flee. Spud discreetly claims his share of the money, and Renton walks away to his new life.\\n\\n==Cast==\\n{{div col}}\\n* [[Ewan McGregor]] as [[Mark Renton|Mark \\\"Rent Boy\\\" Renton]]\\n* [[Ewen Bremner]] as Daniel \\\"Spud\\\" Murphy\\n* [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Simon \\\"Sick Boy\\\" Williamson\\n* [[Robert Carlyle]] as Francis \\\"Franco\\\" Begbie\\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as Thomas \\\"Tommy\\\" Mackenzie\\n* [[Kelly Macdonald]] as Diane Coulston\\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as Swanney \\\"Mother Superior\\\"\\n* [[Fiona Bell]] as Diane's Mother\\n* [[Vincent Friell]] as Diane's Father\\n* Pauline Lynch as Lizzy\\n* Susan Vidler as Allison\\n* Eileen Nicholas as Mrs Renton\\n* [[James Cosmo]] as Davie Renton\\n* [[Shirley Henderson]] as Gail Houston\\n* [[Stuart McQuarrie]] as Gav Temperley/American Tourist\\n* [[Irvine Welsh]] as Mikey Forrester\\n* [[Kevin Allen (actor)|Kevin Allen]] as Andreas\\n* [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] as Hugo the Dealer, reprising his role from ''[[Shallow Grave (1994 film)|Shallow Grave]]'' (1994)\\n* [[Dale Winton]] as Game Show Host\\n* Lauren and Devon Lamb as Baby Dawn (uncredited)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/scotland-now/danny-boyle-tracks-down-twin-10723412|title=Danny Boyle tracks down twin girls he picked to play tragic tot in Trainspotting and is relieved they aren't drug addicts|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|first=Jenny|last=Morrison|date=2 July 2017|access-date=16 November 2019|archive-date=16 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116143116/https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/scotland-now/danny-boyle-tracks-down-twin-10723412|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n{{div col end}}\\n\\n==Production==\\nProducer [[Andrew Macdonald (producer)|Andrew Macdonald]] read [[Irvine Welsh]]'s book on a plane in December 1993, and felt that it could be made into a film.<ref name=\\\"grundy\\\">{{cite news | last = Grundy | first = Gareth | title = Hey!

The republican constitution had many veto points. In order to bypass constitutional obstacles and force through the political goals of the three men, they forged in secret an alliance where they promised to use their respective influence to support each other. The \\\"triumvirate\\\" was not a formal magistracy, nor did it achieve a lasting domination over state affairs.\\n\\nIt was formed among the three men due to their mutual need to overcome opposition in the senate against their proposals in the previous years. Initially secret, it emerged publicly during Caesar's first consulship in 59&nbsp;BC to push through legislation for the three allies. Caesar secured passage of an agrarian law which helped resettle Pompey's veterans, a law ratifying Pompey's settlements after the [[Third Mithridatic War]], and legislation on provincial administration and tax collection. Caesar also was placed in a long-term governorship in Gaul. The early success of the alliance, however, triggered substantial political backlash. Political alliances at Rome reorganised to counterbalance the three men in the coming years.\\n\\nBy 55&nbsp;BC, the alliance was fraying. The three men, however, came together in mutual interest to renew their pact. By force and with political disruption aided by their allies, they delayed consular elections into 55&nbsp;BC and intimidated the ''comitia'' into electing Pompey and Crassus again as consuls. Caesar's command in Gaul was then renewed for another five years; plum provincial commands placed Pompey in [[Hispania|Spain]] and Crassus in [[Roman Syria|Syria]]. Amid even stronger backlash at Rome against the use of naked force and chaos to achieve political ends, Crassus died in 53&nbsp;BC during his failed [[Crassus' invasion of Parthia|invasion of Parthia]].\\n\\nCaesar and Pompey, the two remaining allies, maintained friendly relations for a few years. They remained allies even after Pompey's assumption of a sole consulship in 52&nbsp;BC and the death of Julia (Caesar's daughter and Pompey's wife). Pompey, however, moved to form alliances to counterbalance Caesar's influence after Crassus' death. These drew him slowly into a policy of confrontation with Caesar. Deteriorating trust through 50&nbsp;BC, along with the influence of Catonian anti-Caesarian hardliners on Pompey, eventually pushed Caesar into [[Caesar's civil war|open rebellion]] in January 49&nbsp;BC.\\n\\n== Naming ==\\nThe term \\\"First Triumvirate\\\", while well-known, is a misleading one which is regularly avoided by modern scholars of the late republic. Boards of a certain number of men such as [[decemviri]] were a feature of Roman administration, but this alliance was not counted among them. The term appears nowhere in any ancient source, refers to no official position, and is \\\"completely and obviously erroneous\\\".{{sfn|Ridley|1999|p=143}} In the ancient world, the triple alliance was referred to with varying terms: Cicero, contemporaneously, wrote of \\\"three men\\\" (''tris homines'')<ref>Cic. ''Att.'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi057.perseus-lat1:2.9.2 2.9.2], cited by {{harvnb|Russell|2015}}.</ref> exercising a ''regnum''; a satire by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] called it a \\\"three-headed monster\\\"; later historians such as Suetonius and Livy referred to the three as a ''societas'' or ''conspiratio''; the allies themselves \\\"would presumably have referred to it simply as ''amicitia''\\\".{{sfn|Russell|2015}}\\n\\nThe usage of the term \\\"triumvirate\\\" to describe this political alliance was unattested during the [[Renaissance]]. First attested in 1681,{{sfn|Ridley|1999|p=135}} the term emerged into widespread use only during the 18th century; for some time, knowledge that the term was a modern coinage was unknown, \\\"revealed\\\" only in 1807. By the 19th century, usage was somewhat regular \\u2013 mostly in English and French sources, though not in German ones, \\u2013 usually prefaced with clarifications that the term did not refer to any official position.{{sfn|Ridley|1999|p=139}}\\n\\nMore recently, scholars have started to avoid the term in publications altogether.{{sfn|Russell|2015}} Harriet Flower in ''Roman Republics'' writes that \\\"First Triumvirate\\\" is \\\"misleading in equating the position of the 50s with the [[Second Triumvirate|official triumvirate]] of Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian\\\",{{sfn|Flower|2010|p=148}} preferring \\\"alliance\\\"{{sfn|Flower|2010|p=88}} and \\\"Big Three\\\".{{sfn|Flower|2010|p=149}} Recent books by [[Andrew Lintott]] and [[Richard Billows]] also have avoided invocation of \\\"First Triumvirate\\\".{{sfn|Russell|2015}} Others add more reasons to avoid its use, for example, Robert Morstein-Marx in the recent book ''Julius Caesar and the Roman People'', \\\"it is almost impossible to use the phrase 'First Triumvirate' without adopting some version of the view that it was a kind of conspiracy against the republic... Nomenclature matters... I eschew the traditional 'First Triumvirate' altogether\\\".{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|pp=119\\u201320}} Classicists writing for more general audience also have shied away from use of the term \\\"First Triumvirate\\\". [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], for example, uses \\\"Gang of Three\\\" in her 2015 book ''SPQR''.{{sfn|Beard|2015|p=278}} Yet others, such as [[Adrian Goldsworthy]], have not, staying with the traditional nomenclature while explaining that the term is inaccurate.<ref>See, eg, {{harvnb|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=164\\u201365}}.</ref>\\n\\nThe fourth edition of the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', for example, similarly says \\\"the coalition formed between Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus in 60&nbsp;BCE was wholly unofficial and never described at the time as a triumvirate... 'First' and 'Second Triumvirate' are modern and misleading terms\\\".{{sfn|Cadoux|Lintott|2012}}\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n=== Formation ===\\nThe alliance between [[Pompey]], [[Crassus]], and [[Caesar]] emerged due to their failure to pass various core portions of their programmes in the gridlocked state of Roman politics in the years before 60&nbsp;BC. All three had wanted something from the senate but were stymied.{{sfn|Russell|2015}}\\n\\n==== Pompey ====\\nPompey, having recently returned from the [[Third Mithridatic War]] wanted ratification of his settlements in Asia. He also sought lands for his veterans to retire on.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1pp=109, 112|Russell|2015}} After Pompey's return from the [[Sertorian War]] from [[Hispania]] in 71&nbsp;BC, he had been able secure a similar bill distributing land to his veterans; he also had sent subordinates back to Rome to stand for the tribunate in attempts to bring the relevant legislation forward (an attempt in 63&nbsp;BC was opposed by then-consul [[Cicero]] in ''De lege agraria'').{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=109|Drogula|2019|2p=109 n. 26}} Further attempts in 62&nbsp;BC had led to his [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos (consul 57 BC)|allied tribune]] fleeing from the city. While he was successful in getting one of his men, [[Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus]], elected consul for 61&nbsp;BC, an intervening religious scandal had made it impossible for him to push forward the appropriate land resettlement legislation.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=109}} Through massive bribes, Pompey also secured the election of more of his men to offices in 60&nbsp;BC ([[Lucius Afranius (consul)|Lucius Afranius]] as consul; Lucius Flavius as one of the [[plebeian tribunes]]), but they too were stymied.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=111}} [[Cato the Younger]] and [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer]], motivated in part by their dislike of Pompey's having previously and irregularly displaced their ally [[Lucullus]] from a previous command against [[Mithridates VI Eupator|Mithridates]], Pompey's recent divorce of Celer's half-sister in a failed attempt to form a marriage alliance with Cato,{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=107}} and also by their fear of Pompey's power, led an obstructive coalition.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=111|Russell|2015}} Lucullus returned from his semi-retirement to demand an in-depth review of every aspect of [[Pompey's Eastern Settlement|Pompey's eastern arrangements]]; \\\"this would take a tremendous amount of time and would prevent passage of the bill for the foreseeable future\\\".{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=113}} Without capable allies in the magistracies \\u2013 both Piso and Afranius were ineffective \\u2013 Pompey was forced to look elsewhere for allies.{{sfn|Gruen|1995|p=87}}\\n\\n==== Crassus ====\\nCrassus was one of the richest men in Rome, having made his fortune by profiting from the [[Sulla]]n [[proscription]]s.{{sfn|Badian|2012a}} He was a patron for Rome's [[Equites|equestrian]] [[Publican|businessmen]]. With Pompey, he had served as consul in 70&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Broughton|1952|p=126}} Those public contractors had massively over-bid on tax contracts for the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] (parts of modern western [[Turkey]]) because they failed to account for the devastation of the [[Third Mithridatic War]].{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=114}} His clients demanded a reduction in the taxes they were contractually obliged to deliver to the treasury, a goal also stymied by Cato and Celer in December 61&nbsp;BC.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=115|Russell|2015}} While senators such as Cicero personally believed \\\"it was ridiculous for [the tax farmers] to seek to have their contracts renegotiated or cancelled simply because they had overestimated their potential profits\\\", the senate had been on the verge of approving the legislation before Celer's intervention.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=115}} Crassus, a personal enemy of Pompey, also opposed Pompey's settlements and land bills in 60&nbsp;BC, successfully mobilising his support among the lower-ranked senators to defeat Pompey's proposals.{{sfn|Gruen|1995|p=86\\u201387}} His opposition to Pompey may have been in attempt to win over the senators blocking his own goals, but this was evidently unsuccessful.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=114}} Passing renegotiation of these tax contracts was vital for Crassus: \\\"his reputation and influence depended on his ability to act as a champion for the powerful equestrian order\\\".{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=117}}\\n\\n==== Caesar ====\\nCaesar in 60&nbsp;BC was a recently returning governor of [[Hispania|Spain]].{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=119}} At this point, he was the least powerful of the three,{{sfn|Russell|2015}} although he had, in an upset, won election as [[pontifex maximus]] in 63&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Broughton|1952|p=171}} An energetic politician who had \\\"espoused Pompeian causes for nearly a decade\\\", he was also indebted to Crassus, who was a guarantor of Caesar's debts.{{sfn|Gruen|1995|pp=87\\u201388}} Upon his early return from [[Hispania Ulterior]] in June 60&nbsp;BC,{{sfn|Millar|1998|p=123}} he was forced to choose between [[Pomerium|entering the city]] to declare candidacy for the consulship, which would dissolve his [[Imperium|military command]] and make him ineligible for a [[Roman triumph|triumph]], or staying outside of the city in an attempt to work a triumph from the senate.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|pp=119\\u201320}} While the senate had regularly permitted candidacies ''in absentia'', Cato [[filibuster]]ed Caesar's request; Caesar, shockingly, gave up his eligibility for Rome's highest military honor, the [[Roman triumph|triumph]], to declare his candidacy.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=120}} Caesar was the known favorite for the consulship; to hobble him, Cato and his allies took two actions. They sought to assign the then-yet-to-be-elected consuls of 59&nbsp;BC to \\\"the woodlands and paths of Italy\\\" and sought the election of an uncooperative consular colleague.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=121}} In both respects, they were successful, the consuls of 59 would receive a command with no opportunities for glory or profit \\u2013 incompatible with Caesar's need to repay his huge debts \\u2013 and Cato secured election of his son-in-law and a personal enemy of Caesar's, [[Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus]], as Caesar's co-consul.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=121}} Caesar won his election handily, but to turn it into anything useful for his career, he would need allies.{{sfnm|Gruen|1995|1p=89|Drogula|2019|2p=125}}\\n\\n==== Timing ====\\nScholars have debated the specific date at which the alliance was formed.{{sfn|Gruen|1995|p=88}} [[Plutarch]], [[Livy]], and [[Appian]] placed the formation of the alliance before Caesar's election; [[Velleius Paterculus|Vellius]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] instead put its formation after his election.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=125|Gruen|1995|2p=89}}\\n\\nDuring the elections to the consulship, Caesar certainly received support from both Pompey and Crassus, though \\\"each for his own reasons... Crassus cultivated promising adherents[;] Pompey needed a strong figure in the consulship\\\".{{sfn|Gruen|1995|p=88}} Against the later literary sources, however, a contemporaneous letter to Cicero, where Caesar asked to form a political alliance, also implies Caesar had not yet reconciled Pompey and Crassus by December of 60, months after his election in the summer.{{sfn|Gruen|1995|p=88}} Erich Gruen, in ''Last Generation of the Roman Republic'', believes this letter, combined with the fact that Pompey and Crassus would have alienated each-other with any overt support for Caesar's candidacy, places the alliance's formation decisively after Caesar's consular election.<ref>{{harvnb|Gruen|1995|pp=88\\u201389|ps=. \\\"The conjoining of forces... postdates the inception of Caesar's consulship... only after [Caesar] was safely voted into the consulship would he move to effect reconciliation\\\".}}</ref> Some historians believe Caesar, in his letter to Cicero, may have been coy (\\\"it may also be that Caesar was not yet showing Cicero all of his cards\\\"{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=126}}) but it did show that Caesar \\\"was not specifically looking at building a triumvirate, but rather was looking to build as strong a coalition as possible\\\".{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=126}} This evidence \\u2013 especially disclosure that a pact was sought{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=126 n. 82}} \\u2013 places the formation of the alliance some time between July 60 and January 59&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=127}}{{sfn|Millar|1998|p=124}}\\n\\nThe purpose of the alliance was to secure something that none of the three men could secure alone. If Pompey and Caesar aligned alone, they would not likely be able to overcome opposition to Pompey's proposals in the senate. Pompey and Crassus were personal rivals who could only align through an intermediary. Caesar was that intermediary.{{sfnm|Gruen|1995|1p=89|Drogula|2019|2p=126}} Crassus' motives are less clear. He must have wanted more than simply renegotiation of tax contracts. Crassus' additionally would be one of the administrators for the Pompeian land grants and, in doing so, \\\"the preeminence which Crassus could not quite attain on his own [came] within his grasp\\\".{{sfn|Gruen|1995|pp=89\\u201390}} Caesar needed the alliance as well: he would fully become his own man, \\\"escap[ing] the subordinate stature of Pompey's other ''amici''\\\", defeat the political opposition, and win a profitable command.{{sfn|Gruen|1995|p=89}}\\n\\n=== Caesar's consulship, 59&nbsp;BC ===\\n\\n==== Agrarian law ====\\nIt was well known prior to Caesar's assumption of the consulship with the new year that he would propose a ''[[lex agraria]]''.{{sfn|Millar|1998|p=123\\u201324}} With powerful and secret political allies, Caesar started his consulship of 59&nbsp;BC relatively traditionally. After ordering that minutes of the senate's debates be published, he published a draft proposal for a ''[[lex Julia agraria]]'' and set it on the senate's agenda.{{sfn|Wiseman|1992|p=368}} He took a conciliatory approach, respecting the normal order of the senate and also writing a bill that rectified all the criticisms to Rullus' land bill in 63&nbsp;BC (Cicero opposed that bill in ''De lege agraria''): Caesar would preserve public lands in Campania, repopulate desolate areas of Italy, move citizens from Rome onto the land (reducing the chance of riots), distribute credit for the bill among twenty commissioners (of which Caesar was not to be one), purchase property for redistribution only from willing sellers based on censorial assessments, pay for the entire project from monies won by Pompey, and extend the land grants to Pompey's veterans in return for their service.{{sfn|Wiseman|1992|pp=368\\u201369}}{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=122}}\\n\\nCaesar had the bill read out line-by-line and promised to make any changes needed to receive the assent of the senate.{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=124}} Little reasoned opposition emerged. In general, that an agrarian bill was desirable and \\\"well justified... could not reasonably be denied... many senators must have felt that it was not high time to make good on the promise made long ago to the long-suffering veterans\\\".{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|pp=121\\u201322}} Some ancient sources describe Caesar's conciliatory tone as a cynical plot to roll over the senators; Caesar's goal may have been to provide the senators an opportunity to \\\"adopt symbolic leadership and demonstrate its solicitude for the interests... of the people... [giving] the body a chance to co-opt the cause of agrarian legislation in its own favour\\\".{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|pp=126, 129}}\\n\\n[[File:Cato Volubilis bronze bust.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Cato the Younger]], one of the men who successfully stymied the plans of all of the three allies in the years before their alliance.]]\\n\\nWhether a cynical ploy or not, the senate voiced little opposition until the speaking order eventually wound its way to Cato;{{sfn|Mouritsen|2017|pp=149, 150}} Cato immediately started a filibuster, arguing instead that the people would be too gracious to Caesar for bringing the bill and that the current situation was fine.{{sfn|Tatum|2006|p=199}}{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=129}} The extent to which Caesar's prestige during his first consulship was a topic of debate is unclear; the later sources may here be injecting their knowledge of Caesar's later victories into the narrative.{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=124-25}} Caesar, seeking to break the filibuster, therefore threatened to have Cato sent to the ''carcer'', Rome's small jail, which elicited mass indignation from the senators.{{sfn|Millar|1998|p=126}}{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=130}} In doing so, Cato succeeded in provoking Caesar into giving credence to Cato's claims that Caesar was a would-be tyrant.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|pp=131 (provoking Caesar), 129 (Cato's claims)}} Recognising the mistake, Caesar quickly had Cato released.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=131}} After facing these hurdles in the senate, Caesar moved to bring the agrarian law before the people on his own authority, without senatorial consent.{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=130}}\\n\\nMoving to the forum, Caesar summoned a ''contio'' (a meeting wherein a magistrate would address the people) where he requested Bibulus explain his opposition. When Bibulus failed to articulate any meaningful objections, beyond that \\\"he would not permit any innovation\\\", Caesar pled with him before the people,{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=131}} leading Bibulus to exclaim in frustration that \\\"you will not have this law this year, not even should you all want it!\\\",<ref>{{harvnb|Drogula|2019|p=132|ps=, citing Dio 38.4.3.}}</ref> a violation of the norm of popular sovereignty.<ref>{{harvnb|Morstein-Marx|2021|pp=131\\u201332|ps=, explaining, \\\"consuls had no recognised right of veto over legislation... nor was the mere lack of prior formal approval by the senate valid grounds for a veto... occasionally[, magistrates] did have to be reminded that the people, not the senate, held the power of decision over key issues of legislation and election, but on known occasions where this occurred, they swiftly conceded\\\" (commas introduced).}}</ref> Seeking to avoid a tribunician veto, Caesar exposed his alliance, summoning Pompey and Crassus. Pompey, when asked what he would do if opponents should use violence to disrupt the bill's passage, said \\\"he would provide a shield if anyone dared to raise a sword in opposition\\\".<ref>{{harvnb|Morstein-Marx|2021|pp=134\\u201335|ps=, also dismissing reports from Plutarch that Pompey \\\"filled the city with soldiers and controlled everything by violence\\\" (Plut. ''Pomp.'' 48.1).}}</ref> Bibulus responded by mobilising three tribunes{{efn|The three tribunes with Bibulus were [[Quintus Ancharius (praetor 56 BC)|Quintus Ancharius]], [[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus]], and [[Gaius Fannius]].{{sfnm|Morstein-Marx|2021|1p=137 n. 74|Broughton|1952|2p=189}} }} to veto the bill (alternatively, he may have wanted to declare bad omens to prevent voting, or both).{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|pp=136\\u201337}} During the attempt, he was assaulted by a mob, which threw him from the rostra and broke his ''fasces'', symbolically rejecting Bibulus' consular authority.{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=138}} The law was then passed; the next day, Bibulus called a meeting of the senate seeking to annul the law on grounds that it was passed contrary to the auspices and with violence; annulment on such grounds was extremely rare and the senate, regardless, refused.<ref>{{harvnb|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=140|ps=, dismissing Dio's claim that the senators were \\\"enslaved to the multitude\\\" (Dio 38.6.4) as rather reflecting senatorial deference to the clear will of the people.}}</ref>{{sfn|Wiseman|1992|p=371}} Caesar \\\"provocatively demanded from the senate an oath of obedience to the law and got it\\\" after some pushing and resistance from Cato and some of his allies.{{sfnm|Wiseman|1992|1p=371|Drogula|2019|2pp=135\\u201336}}\\n\\n==== Laws for Pompey and Crassus ====\\nSome time after passage of the agrarian bill, Bibulus withdrew from public business to his home to declare unfavourable omens on all future voting days;{{efn|The effect of declaring unfavourable omens ''in absentia'' was minimal: \\\"It has long been recognised that, in order to be valid... the bad omen... must be announced in person\\\".{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=144 n. 108}} \\\"The embarassing effect for those who treat Bibulus' attempted ''servatio'' as if it ought to have been decisive... is that we have ''no'' well-attested instance ''ever'' of the successful use of the practice to prevent or to retroactive annul legislation\\\".{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=145|ps=&nbsp;(emphasis in original).}} }} the specific time in the year he did so, however, is not known.{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|pp=142 et seq}} Caesar moved two further bills, first, for ratification of a one-third write-down of the tax bills owed by the ''publicani'' for Crassus, and second, for ratification of Pompey's eastern settlement.

Early in the year, he cooperated with them in securing the appointment of a Pompeian ally as one of Caesar's tribunes and obstructed Gabinius' prosecution (for the bribes received to induce his invasion of Egypt), but seeing Pompey's support for one [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] rather than his brother for the consulship of 53&nbsp;BC, he broke with Pompey and launched a prosecution against Scaurus.{{sfn|Gruen|1969|p=102}}\\n\\nThe alliance's opponents, led by Cato's coterie, also launched a broadside against their supporters in the courts:\\n* [[Gaius Porcius Cato (tribune of the plebs 56 BC)|Gaius Porcius Cato]], the tribune in 56 who had vetoed elections to delay them for Pompey and Crassus, was prosecuted but acquitted.

He too was acquitted.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=191}}\\n* [[Publius Vatinius]] was tried for giving bribes in his campaign for praetor. With Cicero's (begrudging) defence, he was acquitted.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=192}}\\n* [[Aulus Gabinius]], one of Pompey's allies and former legates, was tried after his return from Syria in September 54&nbsp;BC for receiving bribes to attack Egypt. He was tried first for treason but acquitted after Pompey bribed the jurors. In a second trial for extortion, Pompey's blatant bribes \\\"had likely led to a surge of resentment\\\" and Gabinius was sent into exile, the only major conviction of the year.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=195}} By this time, consul Pulcher had switched sides, joining in the attack on Gabinius.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=193}}\\n* When Gabinius was sent into exile, a prosecution was launched to recover portions of unpaid fines against one of Gabinius' financial agents who was an ally of Pompey and Caesar. With Cicero's help, he too was acquitted.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|pp=195\\u201396}}\\n\\nAt least three more supporters of the triumvirate were prosecuted; they too were all acquitted.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=192}} Cato and his coterie's judicial attacks were unsuccessful \\\"in large part because the complex network of connections among senators meant that the litigants could not be reduced to stark choices between two political parties or ideologies\\\".{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=192}}\\n\\nThis year also saw the death of Caesar's daughter, and Pompey's wife, Julia, in childbirth. Caesar offered in marriage his grand-niece [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]], but was rebuffed. Pompey's refusal, however, did not indicate a break between the two allies.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=200}} At the time, there was \\\"no demonstrable rupture\\\"; Pompey and Caesar continued to support each other politically for several years.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|pp=200\\u201301}}\\n\\nThe elections for 53&nbsp;BC were hugely delayed due to political violence and bribery.{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=299}} Domitius and Appius Claudius engaged in bribery pact with two consular candidates. Thus, an anti-triumviral consul, a wavering ally, a supporter of the triumvirate ([[Gaius Memmius (poet)|Gaius Memmius]]), and an opponent ([[Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus]]) banded together.<ref>{{harvnb|Drogula|2019|pp=203\\u201304|ps=.

Coupled with raging street battles in the city between Milo and Clodius' armed gangs, elections were finally held after more than seven months without any magistrates, in July 53&nbsp;BC.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=207|Wiseman|1992|2p=405}} Dio attributed these delays to tribunician vetoes against elections of ''interreges'' designed to incite appointment of Pompey as dictator. Pompey was not in the city; his return in the summer and his declining of a dictatorship, however, may have stabilised the city sufficiently \\u2013 both by his presence and by his starting a rapprochement with Cato's conservative faction \\u2013 to allow for elections.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=208|Wiseman|1992|2p=405}} By July, the alliance's support for Scaurus, along with [[Gaius Memmius (poet)|Gaius Memmius]], had gone nowhere.

From the perspective at Rome, news of ambushes against in Gaul arrived first: Caesar abandoned his civil functions in Cisalpine Gaul to rescue his legions wintering in the [[Eburones]]' territory (near modern Belgium).{{sfn|Wiseman|1992|pp=404\\u201305}} A few months later, news of the disaster at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] arrived, reporting that Crassus and much of his army had been killed by the Parthians.{{sfn|Wiseman|1992|p=404}}\\n\\nStill at this point, Caesar and Pompey were on friendly terms. Caesar praised Pompey, for example, for lending one of Pompey's Spanish legions to help against the Gauls, a private military arrangement which Cato criticised in the senate for usurping senatorial prerogatives on legionary assignments.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=209|Wiseman|1992|2p=407}} The consuls immediately prepared to hold elections for 52&nbsp;BC, which proved impossible when they were injured by stones thrown by the crowd.{{sfnm|Gruen|1995|1p=152|Drogula|2019|2p=210}}\\n\\nAs the year 52&nbsp;BC started, the consuls stepped down without replacement. For the first 18 days of the year, tribunes continually interposed their vetoes against election of an ''interrex''. Standing for the consulship in this year were Milo (supported by Cato and others), [[Publius Plautius Hypsaeus]] (one of Pompey's former lieutenants), and [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio]].{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=299}} Clodius, still warring with Milo's street gangs, supported Milo's competitors.{{sfnm|Ramsey|2016|1p=300|Drogula|2019|2p=211}} Some ancient historians \\u2013 including Plutarch, Livy, and Valerius Maximus \\u2013 believed that this violence was all part of a plot to have Pompey appointed dictator.{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=304}} That Pompey desired a dictatorship is unnecessary to explain his opposition to elections; Pompey may have opposed the elections merely because they would have been elections that Milo would have won.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=213}} On 18 January, at a chance counter between Clodius and Milo on a road near a [[Bovillae|suburb]] outside of Rome, Milo's henchmen killed Clodius after a short brawl between their two entourages.{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=300}} The next day, his body was brought back to Rome, where a mob then stormed the senate house and burnt it down \\u2013 along with the [[Basilica Porcia]] \\u2013 as part of Clodius' funeral pyre.{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=300}}\\n\\nAt the resulting senate meeting on the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]], the senate elected an ''interrex''. This was in part because two of the men obstructing senatorial action \\u2013 Pompey and one of the tribunes, [[Titus Munatius Plancus]], \\u2013 were not present.{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=301}} Shortly thereafter, the senate passed a ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' which called for the ''interrex'' and Pompey, as proconsul, to raise troops and take them into the city to restore order.{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=301}} The following eleven ''interreges'' were unable to hold elections.{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|pp=303\\u201304}} However, some fifty-eight days after Clodius' death, with a sufficient force in the city, the twelfth ''interrex'' was able to hold elections.{{sfn|Ramsey|2016|p=303}} At the direction of the senate on motion of Bibulus and supported by Cato, only Pompey's candidacy was accepted, and upon his election, he became consul without colleague.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=214}} The purpose of the decree was possibly to forestall a Pompeian dictatorship or as part of a compromise to restore normal government while also precluding Milo's likely election (allowing Milo to be brought to trial for Clodius' murder).{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=215|Ramsey|2016|2p=313}}\\n\\nAlso around this time, Pompey had married the daughter of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio]], who also was the widow of Crassus' son; this was part of an attempt to win over more allies.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|pp=211\\u201312}} Metellus Pius' family was not part of Cato's coterie (they were personal enemies and Cato's allies had attempted to prosecute him in 60&nbsp;BC) and marrying Crassus' son's widow could win over some of the now-dead Crassus' supporters.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=212|Gruen|1995|2pp=152, 154}}\\n\\nPompey began his consulship by marching soldiers into the city and imposing order by force.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=218}} After passing legislation, he immediately prosecuted Milo for public violence, a move which Cato and Cicero opposed (for this trial, Cicero wrote [[Pro Milone]]). Pompey, however, was able to secure a conviction and forced Milo into exile.{{sfnm|Gruen|1995|1p=154|Drogula|2019|2pp=218\\u201319}} Pompey and Cato also bumped heads on the \\\"Law of the Ten Tribunes\\\" \\u2013 a bill proposed by all ten of the [[Tribune of the plebs|plebeian tribunes]] in the aftermath of news of Caesar's victory at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]] \\u2013 which granted Caesar the right to stand for the consulship ''in absentia'': Pompey supported it; Cato opposed.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1pp=219\\u201320|Wiseman|1992|2p=412}} Amid bribery scandals, Pompey also secured the passage of a law mooted the previous year, which required a delay of five years been magistracy and dispatch to a province. It was meant to break \\\"the nexus of corruption between ambition for office and provincial extortion\\\". Pompey, however, sought and secured exception from his own law, assuming a five year command in Spain immediately.{{sfn|Wiseman|1992|p=413}}\\n\\n=== Collapse, 52\\u201349&nbsp;BC ===\\nThe death of [[Julia (daughter of Caesar)|Julia]] did not mark an immediate collapse in the alliance between Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1pp=200\\u201301|Gruen|1995|2p=450}} The view that her death made a confrontation inevitable is held by a number of ancient sources,<ref>{{harvnb|Gruen|1995|p=450 n. 4|ps=, citing Vell.

Pompey's marriage in 52&nbsp;BC and his another law reaffirming the requirement to declare candidacy for office in person \\\"did not actually harm Caesar directly\\\" but indicated his willingness to build alliances with other, formerly closed off, political groupings.{{sfn|Drogula|2019|p=223}}\\n\\nCato stood for the consulship of 51&nbsp;BC. But after running an honest campaign with little bribery and promises to recall Caesar from Gaul, his canvass was rejected by the people.{{sfn|Tatum|2006|p=206}} Elected instead were [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] and [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]]. The former was an enemy of Caesar and raised in 51&nbsp;BC the question of stripping Caesar of his command,{{sfn|Wiseman|1992|p=415}} arguing that because of Caesar's victory at Alesia, his ''provincia'' (here meaning \\\"task\\\") in Gaul was completed.{{sfnm|Drogula|2019|1p=233|Morstein-Marx|2021|2p=270}} His effort was vetoed; Pompey, too, objected, arguing that removing Caesar before the summer of 50&nbsp;BC would not respect his dignity.{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=270}}\\n\\nAt the elections for the magistrates of 50&nbsp;BC, Caesar's ally [[Gaius Scribonius Curio (tribune 50 BC)|Gaius Scribonius Curio]] was elected tribune; [[Gaius Claudius Marcellus (consul 50 BC)|Gaius Claudius Marcellus]] and [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 50 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] were returned as consuls-designate.{{sfn|Wiseman|1992|p=415}} While Paullus was induced by a massive bribe (Caesar funded his renovation of the ''[[basilica Aemilia]]''),{{sfn|Wiseman|1992|pp=415\\u201316}} Paullus remained only neutral.{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|p=278}} By late 51&nbsp;BC, the coming showdown became clearer: Caesar would induce tribunes to veto discussion of his replacement in Gaul \\u2013 leaving him in command \\u2013 while Cato and his conservatives sought to enlist Pompey to defend against any Caesarian threats and deny Caesar any honours.{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|pp=272\\u201373}} However, Pompey did not immediately come around to breaking with Caesar: he needed Caesar's support to secure a possible command against the Parthians as concerns rose that year over a possible counter-invasion following Crassus' defeat.{{sfn|Morstein-Marx|2021|pp=273\\u201374}}\\n\\nIn the new year, in March 50&nbsp;BC, one of the new consuls, Gaius Claudius Marcellus, raised the question of Caesar's command again.

Moreover, its very success triggered \\\"the coalescence of aristocratic groups in opposition\\\" with greatly lessened success in the later half of the 50s.{{sfn|Gruen|1995|p=91}} Overall, the alliance was \\\"never entirely stable\\\" and was marked by periods of renewal followed by a return to rivalries between the three members. The goals sought together were broadly opportunistic and self-interested.{{sfn|Russell|2015}} The alliance, however, was part of the thinking that went into the creation of the [[Second Triumvirate]] a few decades later.{{sfn|Flower|2010|p=148}}\\n\\nThe formation of the three-way alliance \\\"has been seen as a momentous milestone in the crippling of republican institutions\\\" since ancient times.

Yet their agreement that nothing should be done in Rome that was displeasing to any of the three... changed the rules of the game.

For there had never before been three men with the necessary resources and power to impose their vision on the state.{{sfn|von Ungern-Sternberg|2014|p=91}}\\n}}\\n\\nOthers disagree. Erich Gruen, for example, writes \\\"the union of political cliques in 59 was an information ''amicitia''... [it was] no novelty in Roman politics and simply underlined the mobility of grouping that had been characteristic of previous decades\\\".{{sfn|Gruen|1995|p=90}} In this vein, the alliance can be seen as something similar also to \\\"the kind of political deal the [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus|Saturninus]] and [[Gaius Servilius Glaucia|Glaucia]] were trying to organise in 100\\\"&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Flower|2010|p=148}} Amy Russell, writing in the ''Encyclopedia of Ancient History'', similarly focuses on how the alliance failed to dominate elections, viewing instead the accusations of ''regnum'' from Cicero and lamentations of tyranny as \\\"deriv[ing] from their opponents' rhetoric... [who] at the same time... were working to divide them [the allies]\\\".{{sfn|Russell|2015}} Similarly, Mary Beard says the alliance \\\"was not such a complete takeover as those comments [from Horace and Cicero] imply[;] there were all kinds of strains, disagreements, and rivalries between the three men ... the electoral process sometimes got the better of them and someone quite different, not at all to their liking, was voted in\\\".{{sfn|Beard|2015|p=279}}\\n\\nThe alliance's collapse after Crassus' death was because his death put the two remaining men in competition with one another.

There was also a governor of Skopje called Roman who surrendered the city to the Byzantines in 1004, receiving the title of patrician from [[Basil II]] and becoming a Byzantine ''[[strategos]]'' in Abydus ([[John Skylitzes|Skylitzes]]-Cedr.

This was secured by the marriage of Peter with the Byzantine princess [[Eirene Lakapena|Maria Lakapina]], granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]]. However, after Maria's death in 963, the truce had been shaken and it was at this time or later that Peter I sent his sons [[Boris II of Bulgaria|Boris]] and [[Roman of Bulgaria|Roman]] to [[Constantinople]] as honorary hostages, to honor the new terms of the peace treaty.<ref>According to Zlatarski (''History of the Bulgarian state'', I, 2, [http://www.promacedonia.org/vz1b/vz1b_5_3.html pp. 544, 562.]) the sons of Peter I were sent in the Byzantine capital in 963 as one of the term to resettle the peace treaty of 927. According to other historians such as Andreev (''Who is who in Medieval Bulgaria'', p. 41.) the heirs to the Bulgarian throne became hostages per a Bulgarian-Byzantine agreement against the Kievan Rus' in 968.</ref> During these years the Byzantines and Bulgarians had entangled themselves in [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|a war]] with [[Kievan Rus']] Prince [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]], who invaded Bulgaria several times. After a defeat from Sviatoslav, Peter I suffered a stroke and abdicated his throne in 969 (he died the next year). Boris was allowed back to Bulgaria to take his father's throne, restore order and oppose Sviatoslav, but had little success. This was allegedly used by Nicholas and his sons, who were contemplating a revolt in 969.<ref>Skylitzes records:  He [Peter] himself died shortly afterwards, whereupon the sons were sent to Bulgaria to secure the ancestral throne and to restrain the 'children of the counts' from further t. David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel, children of one of the powerful counts in Bulgaria, were contemplating an uprising and were unsettling the Bulgars'</ref>\\n\\nThe Rus' invaded Byzantine Thrace in 970, but suffered a defeat in the [[Battle of Arcadiopolis (970)|Battle of Arcadiopolis]]. The new Byzantine Emperor [[John Tzimiskes]] used this to his advantage. He quickly invaded Bulgaria the following year, defeated the Rus, and conquered the Bulgarian capital Preslav. Boris II of Bulgaria was ritually divested of his imperial insignia in a public ceremony in Constantinople and he and his brother [[Roman of Bulgaria]] remained in captivity. Although the ceremony in 971 had been intended as a symbolic termination of the Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantines were unable to assert their control over the western provinces of Bulgaria.

Sergeant Robert E. Fears clears an area using his flamethrower. - NARA - 532491.tif|thumb| A U.S. Marine firing a flamethrower during the [[Vietnam War]]]]\\n[[File:Flame Thrower.webm|thumbnail|United States Marines demonstrating flamethrower usage (2012)]]\\n\\nA '''flamethrower''' is a [[ranged weapon|ranged]] [[incendiary device]] designed to project a controllable [[jet (fluid)|jet]] of fire. [[Greek fire|First deployed]] by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[7th century AD]], flamethrowers saw use in modern times during [[World War I]], and more widely in [[World War II]] as a tactical weapon against fortifications.\\n\\nMost military flamethrowers use liquid fuel, typically either [[heated oil]] or [[diesel fuel|diesel]], but commercial flamethrowers are generally [[blowtorch]]es using gaseous fuels such as [[propane|propane; gases]] are safer in peacetime applications, because their flames have less [[mass flow rate]] and dissipate faster, and often are easier to extinguish when necessary.\\n\\nApart from the military applications, flamethrowers have peacetime applications where there is a need for [[controlled burning]], such as in [[sugarcane]] harvesting and other land-management tasks. Various forms are designed for an operator to carry, while others are mounted on vehicles.\\n\\n== Military use ==\\n[[File:German Brennkommando-firing Warsaw 1944.jpg|thumb|German ''[[Brandkommando]]'' (burning detachment) destroying [[Warsaw]] during the planned destruction of the city]]\\n\\nModern flamethrowers were first used during the [[trench warfare]] conditions of [[World War I]] and their use greatly increased in [[World War II]]. They can be vehicle-mounted, as on a tank, or man-portable.\\n\\nThe man-portable flamethrower consists of two elements\\u2014the backpack and the gun. The backpack element usually consists of two or three cylinders. In a two-cylinder system, one cylinder holds compressed, inert propellant gas (usually [[nitrogen]]), and the other holds flammable liquid, typically some form of petrochemical. A three-cylinder system often has two outer cylinders of flammable liquid and a central cylinder of propellant gas to maintain the balance of the soldier carrying it. The gas propels the liquid fuel out of the cylinder through a flexible pipe and then into the gun element of the flamethrower system. The gun consists of a small reservoir, a spring-loaded valve, and an ignition system; depressing a trigger opens the valve, allowing pressurized flammable liquid to flow and pass over the [[spark plug|igniter]] and out of the gun nozzle. The igniter can be one of several ignition systems: A simple type is an electrically heated wire coil; another used a small [[pilot flame]], fueled with pressurized gas from the system.\\n\\nFlamethrowers were primarily used against battlefield fortifications, [[military bunkers|bunkers]], and other protected emplacements. A flamethrower projects a stream of flammable liquid, rather than flame, which allows bouncing the stream off walls and ceilings to project the fire into unseen spaces, such as inside bunkers or [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]]. Typically, popular visual media depict the flamethrower as short-ranged and only effective for a few metres (due to the common use of [[propane]] gas as the fuel in flamethrowers in movies, for the safety of the actors). Contemporary flamethrowers can incinerate a target some {{convert|50|\\u2013|100|m|ft}} from the operator; moreover, an unignited stream of flammable liquid can be fired and afterwards ignited, possibly by a lamp or other flame inside the bunker.\\n\\nFlamethrowers pose many risks to the operator. The first disadvantage is the weapon's weight and length, which impairs the soldier's mobility. The weapon is limited to only a few seconds of burn time, since it uses fuel very quickly, requiring the operator to be precise and conservative. Flamethrowers using a [[Flame fougasse|fougasse-style]] explosive propellant system also have a limited number of shots. The weapon is very visible on the battlefield, which causes operators to become immediately singled out as prominent targets, especially for [[sniper]]s and [[designated marksmen]].

The vulnerability of infantry carrying backpack flamethrowers and the weapon's short range led to experiments with [[tank]]-mounted flamethrowers ([[flame tank]]s), which were used by many countries.\\n\\n==== Axis use ====\\n=====Germany=====\\n<gallery widths=\\\"200px\\\" heights=\\\"200px\\\">\\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-299-1808-15A, Nordfrankreich, Soldat mit Flammenwerfer.jpg|A German soldier operating a flamethrower in 1944\\nFile:German soldier with flamethrower c1941.jpg|A German soldier using a flamethrower in Russia\\nFile:Belgisch-soldaat-slachtoffer-vlammenwerper.jpg|Belgian soldier wounded by a flamethrower (World War I)\\n</gallery>\\n\\nThe Germans made considerable use of the weapon ([[Flammenwerfer 35|''Flammenwerfer'' 35]]) during their invasion of the Netherlands and France, against fixed fortifications. World War II German army flamethrowers tended to have one large fuel tank with the pressurizer tank fastened to its back or side. Some German army flamethrowers occupied only the lower part of its wearer's back, leaving the upper part of his back free for an ordinary rucksack.\\n\\nFlamethrowers soon fell into disfavour. Flamethrowers were extensively used by German units in [[urban warfare|urban fights]] in [[Poland]], both in 1943 in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and in 1944 in the [[Warsaw Uprising]] (see the [[Stroop Report]] and the article on the 1943 [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]). With the contraction of the Third Reich during the latter half of World War II, a smaller, more compact flamethrower known as the [[Einstossflammenwerfer 46]] was produced.\\n\\nGermany also used flamethrower vehicles, most of them based on the chassis of the [[Sd.Kfz. 251#Variants|Sd.Kfz. 251]] half track and the [[Panzer II#Panzer II Flamm|Panzer II]] and [[Bergepanzer III|Panzer III]] tanks, generally known as [[Flame tank#German Army|''Flammpanzers'']].\\n\\nThe Germans also produced the [[Abwehrflammenwerfer 42]], a flame-mine or [[fougasse (weapon)|flame fougasse]], based on a Soviet version of the weapon.<ref name=\\\"lonesentry\\\">{{cite web\\n| url        = http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/static-defenses/index.html\\n| title      = Fougasse Flame Throwers from Intelligence Bulletin, November 1944 \\n| work       = lonesentry.com\\n| access-date = 3 August 2010\\n}}</ref> This was essentially a disposable, single use flamethrower that was buried alongside conventional land mines at key defensive points and triggered by either a trip-wire or a command wire.

Starting in New Guinea, through the closing stages on Guadalcanal and during the approach to and reconquest of the Philippines and then through the Okinawa campaign, the Army deployed hand-held, man-portable units.\\n\\nOften flamethrower teams were made up of combat engineer units, later with troops of the chemical warfare service. The Army fielded more flamethrower units than the Marine Corps, and the Army's Chemical Warfare Service pioneered tank mounted flamethrowers on Sherman tanks (CWS-POA H-4). All the flamethrower tanks on Okinawa belonged to the 713th Provisional Tank Battalion.  It was tasked with supporting all U.S. Army and Marine infantry.  All Pacific mechanized flamethrower units were trained by Seabee specialists with Col. Unmacht's [[Seabees in World War II|CWS Flamethrower Group]] in Hawaii.\\n\\nThe U.S. Army used flamethrowers in Europe in much smaller numbers, though they were available for special employments. Flamethrowers were deployed during the [[Normandy landings]] in order to clear [[Axis powers|Axis]] fortifications.<ref>{{cite book|last = Holderfield| first = Randy| title = D-Day: The Invasion of Normandy, June 6, 1944 | publisher = Da Capo Press| year = 2001| page=76| isbn =1-882810-46-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Drez| first = Ronald| title = Voices of D-Day: The Story of the Allied Invasion, Told by Those Who Were There | publisher = Louisiana State University Press| year = 1998| pages=35, 201\\u2013211| isbn =0-8071-2081-2}}</ref>  Also, most boat teams on [[Omaha Beach]] included a two-man flamethrower team.<ref>{{cite book|last = Balkoski| first = Joseph| title = Omaha Beach: D-Day, June 6, 1944 | publisher = Stackpole Books| year = 2004| page=368| isbn =0-8117-0079-8}}</ref>\\n\\nThe Marine Corps used the backpack-type [[M2A1-7 flamethrower|M2A1-7]] and [[M2-2]] flamethrowers, finding them useful in clearing Japanese trench and bunker complexes. The first known USMC use of the man portable flamethrower was against the formidable defenses at Tarawa in November 1943. The Marines pioneered the use of Ronson-equipped M-3 Stuart tanks in the Marianas. These were known as SATAN flame tanks. Though effective, they lacked the armour to safely engage fortifications and were phased out in favour of the better-armoured M4 Sherman tanks. USMC Flamethrower Shermans were produced at [[Schofield Barracks]] by Seabees attached to the Chemical Warfare Service under Col. Unmacht. CWS designated [[M4 flame fuel thickening compound|M4s]] with \\\"CWS-POA-H\\\" for \\\"Chemical Warfare Service Pacific Ocean Area, Hawaii\\\" plus a flamethrower number. The Marines had previously deployed large Navy flamethrowers mounted on LVT-4 AMTRACs at Peleliu. Late in the war, both services operated LVT-4 and \\u22125 amphibious flametanks in limited numbers. Both the Army and the Marines still used their infantry-portable systems, despite the arrival of adapted Sherman tanks with the Ronson system (cf. [[Chemical Warfare Service: Flame Tank Group Seabees|flame tanks]]).\\n\\nIn cases where the Japanese were entrenched in deep caves, the flames often consumed the available oxygen, suffocating the occupants.  Many Japanese troops interviewed post war said they were terrified more by flamethrowers than any other American weapon. Flamethrower operators were often the first U.S. troops targeted.\\n\\n===== Soviet Union =====\\n[[file:Finnish soldier with a ROKS-3 flamethrower SA-kuva 131383.jpg|upright|right|thumb|A Finnish soldier with a captured Soviet ROKS-3 flamethrower, June 1943.

They could also be categorized as a projecting incendiary mine. The FOG had only one cylinder of fuel, which was compressed using an explosive charge and projected through a nozzle. The November 1944 issue of the US War Department ''Intelligence Bulletin'' refers to these \\\"[[Fougasse (weapon)|Fougasse]] flame throwers\\\" being used in the Soviet defense of Stalingrad. The FOG-1 was directly copied by the Germans as the [[Abwehrflammenwerfer 42]].\\n\\nUnlike the flamethrowers of the other powers during World War II, the Soviets were the only ones to consciously attempt to [[camouflage]] their infantry flamethrowers. With the [[ROKS-2 flamethrower]] this was done by disguising the flame projector as a standard-issue rifle, such as the [[Mosin\\u2013Nagant]], and the fuel tanks as a standard infantryman's rucksack. This was to try to stop the flamethrower operator from being specifically targeted by enemy fire.<ref name=\\\"Bishop2002\\\">{{cite book |author=Chris Bishop |title=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA270 |year=2002 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company |isbn=978-1-58663-762-0 |pages=270\\u2013}}</ref> This \\\"rifle\\\" had a working action which was used to cycle blank igniter cartridges.\\n\\n=== 1945\\u20131980 ===\\n\\n==== US military ====\\n[[File:US riverboat using napalm in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A riverboat of the U.S. [[Brown-water navy|Brownwater Navy]] shooting ignited [[napalm]] from its mounted flamethrower during the Vietnam war]]\\n[[File:Marineflametank1968.jpg|thumb|An [[M67 Flame Thrower Tank|M67 \\\"Zippo\\\"]] tank of the USMC during the Vietnam War]]\\n\\nThe [[United States Marines]] used flamethrowers in the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War]]s.

({{IPA-cs|\\u02c8j\\u026a\\u0266lava|-|Cs-Jihlava.ogg}}; {{lang-de|Iglau}}) is a city in the [[Czech Republic]]. It has about 54,000 inhabitants. Jihlava is the capital of the [[Vyso\\u010dina Region]], situated on the [[Jihlava (river)|Jihlava]] River on the historical border between [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]].\\n\\nHistorically, Jihlava is the oldest mining town in the Czech Republic, older than [[Kutn\\u00e1 Hora]].

Most common theory has it derived from the German word ''Igel'', meaning \\\"hedgehog\\\", usually in reference to the city's coat of arms. However, the name was in use since before the symbol of a hedgehog was. It is more likely the city is named for the river that flows through it, the name of which is also unclear in its origin, either being derived from the German word ''Igel'' as the first theory suggests, or from Slavic word ''jehla'' (i.e. \\\"needle\\\"), referring to sharp stones in the Jihlava river bed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jihlavsk\\u00fd je\\u017eek m\\u00e1 stovky podob.

The first written mention of Jihlava is from 1233. The mining of silver began here in 1234 and the royal mining town was established between 1233 and 1240. Jihlava thus became the oldest mining town in what is today the Czech Republic.<ref name=thall>{{cite web |title=Town Hall of Jihlava|url=https://www.jihlava.cz/en/vismo/o_utvar.asp?id_org=100405&id_u=1640|publisher=Statut\\u00e1rn\\u00ed m\\u011bsto Jihlava|access-date=2022-04-22}}</ref><ref name=history>{{cite web |title=History|url=https://www.jihlava.cz/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=100405&id=1001&p1=2680|publisher=Statut\\u00e1rn\\u00ed m\\u011bsto Jihlava|access-date=2022-04-22}}</ref>\\n\\nThe village was originally located on the left bank of the river Jihlava, but with the expansion of mining and the influx of inhabitants, the town spread to the right bank, where its historic centre was established. The regular plan of the rectangular network of streets with a large square in the middle was given by the building regulations of King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] from 1270. Royal privileges guaranteed prosperity and Jihlava soon became one of the most powerful cities in the kingdom. It was protected by a massive fortification and coins were minted here. It became the first city in Central Europe where mining law was codified.<ref name=thall/><ref name=history/>\\n\\nMining attracted settlers from [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]] and other German-speaking regions to the city.

She can now take the {{cards|5C}} and the {{cards|6C}} from the table and make a new meld with her {{cards|7C}}.\\n* On the table lie the {{cards|5D|6D|7D}} and {{cards|5S|6S|Jkrb}}; Ben holds {{cards|5C}}, {{cards|6H}} and {{cards|9D}} in his hand. He can now combine these cards together with the table cards to form new melds as follows: {{cards|5D|5S|5C}}, {{cards|6D|6H|6S}} and {{cards|7D|Jkrb|9D}}.\\n\\nAny jokers on the table may be re-used to represent a different card without having to be exchanged as in [[German Rummy]], for example.\\n\\nA player who was unable or disinclined to place at least one card from their own hand on the table accordingly, must draw one card from the stock into the hand. Alternatively, a player who did place one or more own cards on the table may draw one card from the stock, or must otherwise yield to the next player right away. After having drawn one card, the player at turn may still place any one or more cards on the table, and must then yield to the next player without drawing another card.<ref name = junglerummy/>\\n\\nDanyliuk includes 2 additional rules:<ref name=Danyliuk/>\\n\\n* The top card of the discard pile may only be used if it is immediately laid off or melded; it must not be added to the hand.\\n* The player's first meld must score 40 points; cards may be laid off to existing melds in order to reach this total. To do this card values are assigned as follows: A = 1 or 11 depending on position, KQJ = 10 each, pips = 2-9 depending on face value.\\n\\n== Ending ==\\nThe first player to meld or lay off all held cards is the winner.<ref name=Danyliuk/>\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==See also==\\n*[[German Rummy]]\\n*[[Liverpool Rummy]]\\n*[[Machiavelli (Italian card game)]]\\n\\n{{Non trick-taking card games}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robbers' Rummy}}\\n[[Category:Rummy]]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"quality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"C\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Discover @ARTandHUE's stylish Beano pop art prints in 3 sizes & 18 colours at http://artandhue.com/beano #TheBeano #Beano @BeanoOfficial #RogerTheDodger}}</ref> and is one of the longest-running characters, characterised by his tactics for avoiding responsibility and his parents rules, or simply making chores easier, usually with the help of instructional \\\"dodge\\\" books.\\n\\n== Character background ==\\nKen Reid was recommended to [[DC Thomson]] by his brother-in-law Bill Holroyd, who illustrated for ''[[The Beano]]''. Reid travelled to [[Dundee]] and was first tasked to design comic strip panels for a new character: a boy who did anything to evade responsibilities and favours.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Riches |editor1-first=Christopher |title=The History of The Beano: The story so far |date=2008 |publisher=Waverley Books |isbn=9781902407739 |page=119}}</ref>\\n\\nAfter the design was approved, a three-panel advertisement printed in issue 560, showing Roger failing to sneak out the house before his father noticing, finding out instantly that his father had set up a [[tripwire]]. The caption revealed this was a [[Teaser campaign|teaser]] to a new comic strip called ''Roger the Dodger'', boasting, \\\"You really think his dad has really caught him dodging his homework, don't you? JUST YOU WAIT! ROGER ISN'T FINISHED YET!\\\"<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=GREAT NEWS! ROGER THE DODGER IS COMING!|date=1953-04-11|magazine=The Beano|publisher=D.C. Thomson & Co. Ltd.|issue=560|others=Illustrated by [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]]|editor-last=Moonie|editor-first=George|publication-date=1953-04-09}}</ref>\\n\\n==Characteristics==\\nUnlike most Beano characters, Roger does not intentionally cause chaos and mayhem, despite his attempts at dodging responsibilities and punishments often creating it. Ken Reid's early stories frequently had Roger get caught by his family members, that do not hesitate with the cruelty of their vengeance. Reid's final panels would show Roger being forced to do his chore (or clean up after his antics create more damage than intended) as a family member (usually his father) supervises with a smirk.\\n\\nRoger has dark hair with a shaggy tuft at the front. He wears a red-and-black [[Chequered cloth|chequered]] jumper over his white, collared shirt. Initially he wore a tie, but this was discontinued in the 21st century, as well as the black shorts he also wore, that were changed to black trousers in the 1970s.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nHe first appeared in issue 561, dated 18 April 1953.<ref name=\\\"birthday\\\"/> His appearance is vaguely similar to that of [[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]] from the same magazine: he wears a black-and-red chequered jumper and black trousers, but takes better care of his hair than his equally mischievous counterpart. He also used to have a white tie, but it seems to have disappeared. Originally drawn by [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]], [[Gordon Bell (artist)|Gordon Bell]] took over in 1959, but Roger dodged his way out of the Beano in 1960. He returned, drawn by [[Bob McGrath]], in April 1961. Ken Reid was re-commissioned to draw the strip in 1962, and [[Robert Nixon (artist)|Robert Nixon]] when Reid left [[D. C. Thomson & Co.]] in 1964. When Nixon left in 1973, [[Tom Lavery]] began drawing the strip, who was then followed by [[Frank McDiarmid (comics)|Frank McDiarmid]] in 1976.\\n\\nTen years later, after [[Euan Kerr]] took over as Beano editor, Nixon returned, drawing in a noticeably different style from the one before. Roger's strip was given a second page in 1986. Between 1986 and 1992, a spin-off strip appeared at the end called ''Roger the Dodger's Dodge Clinic''. Readers would write in with problems, and Roger would try to find a dodge for it (which would usually go wrong). Winning suggestions would win a [[transistor radio]] and special scroll. Roger is often shown in other Beano characters' stories offering \\\"help\\\", which he took to a new level in Beano issue 2648 from April 1993. This issue marked Roger's 40th birthday, and to celebrate he made appearances in every strip in the comic.\\n\\nNixon continued drawing it until his death in October 2002, though due to the strips being drawn months in advance, his strips continued appearing in the Beano until the end of January 2003, when artist [[Barrie Appleby]] took over. He drew the strip until 2011, when he stopped to concentrate on Dennis and Gnasher, though [[Trevor Metcalfe]] drew a few strips in 2003 and 2004, and there have also been some [[Robert Nixon (artist)|Robert Nixon]] reprints during 2005 and 2006. Since Appleby stopped drawing Roger, the comic has run reprints of Robert Nixon strips from the 1980s. Along with the Nixon reprints, '''Roger's Dodge Diary''' was introduced on the second half of Roger's pages, where Beano readers can send in their own dodges. In each one, Roger says a good thing, a bad thing and the results of the dodge. When the Beano was revamped on 8 August 2012, Appleby started drawing Roger again and Roger's parents were made younger. In the 75th birthday issue released on 24 July 2013, [[Jamie Smart]] took over as artist. On 9 April 2014, [[Wayne Thompson (cartoonist)|Wayne Thompson]] replaced [[Jamie Smart]] as Roger's artist, until Barrie Appleby returned to draw the strip temporarily, before Wayne Thompson surprisingly returned. In 2017, writing duties for the strip were taken over by Danny Pearson.\\n\\nRoger is currently the second-longest-running character in the Beano, behind only [[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]]. However, if taken into account the strip's absence in 1960 then he would be the third-longest-running behind [[Minnie the Minx]].\\n\\n==Other characters in the strip==\\n*'''Willow''' and '''Bill''' Dawson . In one strip in the Beano Book from 1957, his dad's is referred to as Bill. He has occasionally been shown to have been a dodger in his youth and on occasion asks Roger for dodging help. His parents were renamed in later years to '''Les''' and '''Ada'''.<ref name=superstar/>\\n*His rival is a bully named '''Cruncher Kerr''' (believed to be named after [[Euan Kerr]], though his earliest appearances predate Kerr's appointment as Beano Editor in 1994).\\n*Roger has had two different pets, firstly a [[Crow]] called '''Joe the Crow''', and secondly a Cat called '''Dodge Cat'''.\\n*Roger also had two friends, called '''Crafty Colin''' and '''Sneaky Pete'''. These two mainly appeared in the 1990s, though Pete did reappear in the 2006 Beano Annual. However, in the late 2000s Roger gained a new friend called '''Dave'''.\\n\\n==Timeline==\\n\\n'''18 April 1953:''' Roger The Dodger made his debut in issue 561, drawn by [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]].<br/>\\n'''1959:''' [[Gordon Bell (artist)|Gordon Bell]] becomes the artist.<br/>\\n'''1960:''' Roger's first series ends.<br/>\\n'''April 1961:''' Roger returns to the Beano, drawn by Bob McGrath.<br/>\\n'''1962:''' Reid becomes Roger's artist again.<br/>\\n'''1964:''' [[Robert Nixon (artist)|Robert Nixon]] takes over.<br/>\\n'''1973:''' Tom Lavery takes over.<br/>\\n'''1976:''' Frank McDiarmid takes over.<br/>\\n'''1986:''' Nixon returns to draw Roger again, he moves to two pages and '''Roger The Dodger's Dodge Clinic''' is introduced.<br/>\\n'''1992:''' '''Roger The Dodger's Dodge Clinic''' ends.<br/>\\n'''April 1993:''' Roger's 40th anniversary is celebrated.<br/>\\n'''January 2003:''' [[Barrie Appleby]] takes over after Nixon's death.<br/>\\n'''2011:''' Appleby stops drawing Roger to focus on [[Dennis and Gnasher]], and '''Roger's Dodge Diary''' is introduced alongside Nixon reprints.<br/>\\n'''2012:''' Appleby resumes drawing Roger after Nigel Parkinson takes over Dennis and Gnasher.<br/>\\n'''July 2013:''' [[Jamie Smart]] takes over as artist.<br/>\\n'''April 2014:''' Wayne Thompson takes over as artist.<br/>\\n'''July 2014:''' [[Barrie Appleby]] returns as artist.<br/>\\n'''April 2023:''' Roger's 70th anniversary is celebrated.<br/>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===TV===\\n\\nRoger appears on the cover of 1994's ''Beano Videostars'' but not on the video itself.

It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use [[3D computer graphics]] overlaid on [[Rendering (computer graphics)|pre-rendered]] static backgrounds. As with other [[LucasArts adventure games]], the player must converse with characters and examine, collect, and use objects to solve puzzles.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' is set in the Land of the Dead and the [[retro-futuristic]] version of the 1950s, through which recently departed souls, represented as ''[[calaca]]''-like figures, travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" [[Calavera]] as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the [[Aztec religion#Cosmology and ritual|Aztec afterlife]] with ''[[film noir]]'' style, with influences including ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the greatest video games of all time]]. However, it was a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]] and contributed towards LucasArts' decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre.\\n\\nIn 2014, with help from [[Sony]], Schafer's studio [[Double Fine Productions]] acquired the ''Grim Fandango'' license following [[Disney]]'s acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. Double Fine produced a remastered version of the game, featuring improved character graphics, controls (including point and click), an orchestrated score, and directors' commentary. It was released for [[Linux]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and Windows in January 2015, for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] in May 2015, for [[Nintendo Switch]] in November 2018, and for [[Xbox One]] in October 2020.\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\n''Grim Fandango'' is an [[adventure game]], in which the player controls Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" Calavera (''[[calavera]]'' being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the [[GrimE]] engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from [[3D model]]s, while the main objects and characters are animated in [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name=\\\"bwire080997\\\" /> Additionally, cutscenes in the game have also been pre-rendered in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], a [[joystick]], or a [[gamepad]]. The remastered edition allows control via a [[computer mouse|mouse]] as well. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve [[puzzle]]s and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head toward that object or person as he walks by.<ref name=\\\"sfgate review\\\"/> The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in and out of his coat jacket.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer retrospective\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-05-retrospective-grim-fandango |title=Retrospective: Grim Fandango |first=Jeffery |last=Matulef |date=February 5, 2012 |access-date=February 5, 2012 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509093631/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-05-retrospective-grim-fandango |archive-date=May 9, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through [[conversation tree]]s to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot.<ref name=\\\"manual\\\">{{cite book |title=Grim Fandango Instruction Manual |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |year=1998 |url=http://www.brainygamer.com/VGC/GrimManual.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043524/http://www.brainygamer.com/VGC/GrimManual.pdf |archive-date=September 15, 2012 |access-date=October 11, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never [[game over|die]] or otherwise get into a [[no-win situation#Video games|no-win situation]] (that prevents completion of the game).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |title=The Greatest Games of All Time: Day of the Tentacle |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=April 30, 2004 |access-date=March 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402084445/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |archive-date=April 2, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\n== Synopsis ==\\n=== Setting ===\\n''Grim Fandango'' takes place in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld) on the Four Year Journey of the Soul.

Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs and stay in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the [[Grim Reaper]] to escort the souls from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the [[Day of the Dead]], these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.<ref name=\\\"manual\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Schafer design diary\\\"/>\\n\\nThe souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal ''calaca'' figures.<ref name=\\\"Schafer design diary\\\"/> Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of day-to-day life, such as vehicle maintenance and even drink service.

Manny steals a client, Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, from his successful co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the \\\"Number Nine\\\" luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Manny''': Meche.

Don Copal uses it as a reason to arrest Manny. Manny was freed from arrest and sprouting by Salvador \\\"Sal\\\" Limones, the leader of the small underground organization the Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who warns him of Domino and Don rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Salvador''': I was once a reaper like yourself Manuel, but I uncovered a web of corruption in our beloved Department of Death.

Sal recruits Manny to help LSA by setting up a system of [[pigeon mail]] and providing the group with [[biometrics]] of Manny in order to access the computer systems of the Department. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to arrive.\\n\\n[[Image:Grim-fandango-cast.jpg|left|thumb|The cast of ''Grim Fandango''.

Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny sees Meche leaving the port with Domino, but when he tries to stop them, he himself was stopped by Meche. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda, the owner of the beatnik Blue Casket nightclub, that Don has been sprouted for letting the scandal be known.\\n\\nManny gives chase, manages to get on a board of leaving ship as a janitor, and a year later (after being promoted to a captain) tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Meche''': You were headed for a trap, I was trying to warn you. Domino was using me like bait. I didn't want you to end up a prisoner here like me.}}</ref> All of Domino's clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor, both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hector's scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and a few of the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.\\n\\nThe three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. The Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won't let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them, and it's further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or stolen Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train (which sends all souls on board to hell). Meanwhile, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a \\\"rocket\\\" train cart, quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis' life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Mechanics''': We shoot you now like an arrow into the wind. May you pierce the heart of the wind itself, and drink the blood of flight. Speed is the food of the great Glottis. Speed bring you life. Come back to us some day.}}</ref> The three return to El Marrow, now found to be fully in Hector's control and renamed as Nuevo Marrow. Manny regroups with Sal and his expanded LSA and with the help of Olivia, who volunteered to join the gang earlier in Rubacava, and is able to learn about Hector's current activities.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Salvador''': Manuel Calavera, we meet again.

Under new management, LucasArts licensed several of its [[intellectual property|intellectual properties]] (IP), including ''Grim Fandango'', to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\"/> Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island#2009 rerelease|The Secret of Monkey Island]]''.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\"/> Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from LucasArts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and [[platform evangelism|developer relations]] [[Adam Boyes (entrepreneur)|Adam Boyes]], was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} after seeing developers like [[Capcom]] and [[Midway Games]] revive older properties. Boyes' determination was supported by John Vignocchi, VP of Production for [[Disney Interactive]], who also shared memories of the game, and was able to bring in contacts to track down the game's assets.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> After discovering they were vying for the same property, Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding, planning to make the re-release a remastered version.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-24-bringing-out-the-dead-tim-schafer-reflects-back-on-grim-fandango |title=Bringing out the Dead: Tim Schafer reflects back on Grim Fandango |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=January 26, 2015 |access-date=January 26, 2015 |first=Jeffrey |last=Matulef |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128094744/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-24-bringing-out-the-dead-tim-schafer-reflects-back-on-grim-fandango |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/27/7921837/grim-fandango-remastered-interview-double-fine-disney-lucasfilm-sony |title=Digital Archeology: How Double Fine, Disney, Lucasarts and Sony Resurrected Grim Fandango |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Dave |last=Tach |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128123552/http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/27/7921837/grim-fandango-remastered-interview-double-fine-disney-lucasfilm-sony |archive-date=January 28, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game, instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support, similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/>\\n\\n====Challenges====\\n[[File:Grim fandango remastered comparison.png|thumb|right|A comparison of ''Grim Fandango'' from its original release (top) and the remastered version. Double Fine increased texture resolution and improved lighting models to improve the looks of the characters.]]\\n\\nA major complication in remastering the original work was having many of the critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer [[Jory Prum]] had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nSchafer noted at the time of ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} original development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present-day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/> In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nOnce original assets were identified, as to be used to present the \\\"classic\\\" look of the game in the Remastered edition, Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers. The textures and lighting models for the characters were improved, in particular for Manny.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> Schafer has likened the remastering approach to [[The Criterion Collection]] film releases in providing a high-fidelity version of the game without changing the story or the characters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Diver |first1=Mike |title=Tim Schafer Discusses the Classic Video Games 'Grim Fandango' and 'Monkey Island' |url=https://www.vice.com/read/tim-schafer-discusses-grim-fandango-and-monkey-island-990 |website=VICE |access-date=February 2, 2015 |date=January 27, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130043109/http://www.vice.com/read/tim-schafer-discusses-grim-fandango-and-monkey-island-990 |archive-date=January 30, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\nIn addition to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created [[unofficial patch]]es and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in [[ResidualVM]], and gained their help to improve the game's assets for the remastered version.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/06/10/a-closer-look-at-grim-fandangos-surprise-revival |title=A Closer Look at Grim Fandango's Surprise Revival |first=Asif |last=Siddiky |publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]] |date=June 10, 2014 |access-date=June 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813064108/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/06/10/a-closer-look-at-grim-fandangos-surprise-revival/ |archive-date=August 13, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-remastered-grim-fandango-heading-to-ps4-vita/1100-6420283/ |title=E3 2014: Remastered Grim Fandango heading to PS4, Vita - Tim Schafer's classic adventure game headed to current-gen Sony consoles. |last1=Ramsay |first1=Randolph |date=June 9, 2014 |website=GameSpot |access-date=October 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002172725/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-remastered-grim-fandango-heading-to-ps4-vita/1100-6420283/ |archive-date=October 2, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=5 things from E3 Sony PS event |first=Brett |last=Molina |newspaper=USA Today |date=June 11, 2014 |page=5B \\u2013 Money Section}}</ref> One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game's movement controls from the [[tank controls]] to a [[point and click]]-style interface.

The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 4:3 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's ''[[Broken Age]]''). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game.

Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an auto-save system, as well as the game not receiving a full high-definition upgrade, leaving the higher-resolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"gamespot rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"ign rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/> Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles, though a staple of the day when ''Grim Fandango'' was first released, remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them, and that a hint system, as was added to the ''Monkey Island'' remake, would have been very helpful.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: it's worth admiring this lovingly restored antique |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Oliver |last=Cragg |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206185431/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |archive-date=February 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/02/03/grim-fandango-remastered-review-a-witty-but-tedious-classic/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: A witty but tedious classic |first=Christopher |last=Byrd |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> The game's pacing, also unchanged from the original version, was also found harder to grasp, in both the pacing within the game's four acts, and the time taken to move around and between rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered is a flawed remake of a considered masterpiece |website=Ars Technica |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Steven |last=Strom |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128021850/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref> In his review for [[Eurogamer]], Richard Cobbett warned players to \\\"be careful of rose-tinted memories\\\", that while the remastered version is faithful to the original, it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in video game development.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'s}} Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was \\\"an artifact of its time, an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing\\\".<ref name=\\\"wired rm review\\\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered/ |title=I Love You, Grim Fandango, Even Though You're Broken |first=Laura |last=Hudson |date=January 29, 2015 |access-date=January 29, 2015 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201130938/http://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered |archive-date=February 1, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n==Legacy==\\nIn 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' characterized the game as \\\"the last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer's noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead.

He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. One option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]].<ref>{{cite web

He was famous for his comic and character roles [[Stanley Holloway on stage and screen|on stage and screen]], especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. He was also renowned for his [[Songs and monologues of Stanley Holloway|comic monologues and songs]], which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.\\n\\nBorn in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in ''[[Kissing Time]]'' when the musical transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1921, he joined a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]], ''[[The Co-Optimists]]'', and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by [[Marriott Edgar]], were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in [[variety show|variety]], [[pantomime]] and musical comedy, including several [[revue]]s.\\n\\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Path\\u00e9 News]] and took character parts in a series of films including ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'', ''[[The Way Ahead]]'', ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' and ''[[The Way to the Stars]]''. In the decade after the war, he appeared in the film ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' and ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]''.\\n\\nIn 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in ''My Fair Lady'', a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version in 1964]]. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor [[Julian Holloway]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\n\\n===Family background and early life===\\nHolloway was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]], [[Essex]] (now in the [[London Borough of Newham]]), on 1 October 1890.

It is particularly associated with two families: the Beauforts, who held the title from the creation of 1448, and the Seymours, from the creation of 1547, in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique, in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Kingdom of England]], using a power granted in the will of his nephew [[King Edward VI]].\\n\\nThe only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is '''Baron Seymour''', which is used as a [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles, yet the holder's [[Order of precedence|precedence]] is higher than his title suggests, by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset (the only more senior non-royal duke is the [[Duke of Norfolk]]).\\n\\nSeveral other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset, but have become extinct. These include: [[Earl of Kendal]] (created 1443, extinct 1444), [[Earl of Somerset]] (created 1397, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Dorset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399; created 1442, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Somerset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399), [[Earl of Dorset]] (created 1441, forfeit 1461), ''Viscount Rochester'' (created 1611, extinct 1645), ''Viscount Beauchamp of Hache'' (created 1536, forfeit 1552), [[Earl of Hertford]] (created 1537, forfeit 1552; and created 1559, extinct 1750), [[Marquess of Hertford]] (created 1640, extinct 1675), [[Baron Seymour of Trowbridge]] (created 1641, extinct 1750), [[Baron Percy]] (created 1722, separated 1750), ''[[Baron Cockermouth]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), ''[[Earl of Egremont]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), and ''Earl St. Maur'' (created 1863, extinct 1885).\\n\\nThe ducal seat is [[Bradley House (Wiltshire)|Bradley House]] in [[Maiden Bradley]], west [[Wiltshire]], with a secondary estate at [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]], [[Totnes]], [[Devon]]. The principal burial place for the Seymour family today is [[All Saints' Church, Maiden Bradley]], adjacent to Bradley House; the church and the family cemetery can be reached from the grounds of Bradley House via private access.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/maidenbradley/maiden-bradley-times/duke-s-grave The grave of Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset], 19 July 2013</ref>\\n\\n==Creation of Empress Matilda==\\n[[William de Mohun of Dunster]] (?\\u2013c. 1155), a favourite of [[Empress Matilda]] and a loyal supporter of her in the war against [[Stephen I of England|King Stephen]] (during which he earned the epithet of the \\\"Scourge of the West\\\"), was given the title Earl of Somerset in 1141.

The patent of the dukedom specified that it was to descend to his issue by his second wife Anne Stanhope, thus excluding his eldest son by his first wife from the title, except in case of the failure of male heirs from the junior line. In 1547 he bought [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon from Sir Thomas Pomeroy,  although he probably never visited it, and it became the seat of his eldest son from his first marriage, Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593), whose son was made a [[Seymour baronets|baronet \\\"of Berry Pomeroy\\\"]].

She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch (1711\\u20131773), daughter of [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham]]. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748, at [[Petworth House]], [[Sussex]]<ref name=\\\"6th\\\"/> at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Seymour]] (1684\\u20131750).\\n\\n;Later subsidiary titles\\nAlgernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749, the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Hugh Smithson]], husband of Algernon's daughter Elizabeth Seymour (bef. 1730\\u20131776), whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister, Lady Catherine Seymour (1693\\u20131731). Without male issue, on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford, the barony of Beauchamp, and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct; and the dukedom of Somerset, together with the barony of Seymour, devolved on his distant cousin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://familytrees.genopro.com/ralphballard/default.htm?page=BaronPercy7thDukeOfSomers-Algernon-ind00244.htm | title=Algernon Baron Percy, 7th Duke of Somerset, Earl of Northumberland | publisher=Moore, Simpson, Ballard Family Tree \\u2013 England and Scotland to Australia | access-date=27 December 2010}}</ref>\\n\\n;Later descent\\nSir [[Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy]] (1694\\u20131757) became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750. The 1st baronet was (Sir) Edward Seymour (1556\\u20131613), son of Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593) who was the 1st Duke's eldest son and of Catherine Seymour (n\\u00e9e Filliol). He was a seventh-generation descendant of the 1st Duke. The 4th Baronet had been speaker of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and he moved the family home from [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon to Bradley House in [[Maiden Bradley]].<ref>Report and Transactions of The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and the Arts. Vol 133 (2001), p 11-12.</ref>\\n\\nUpon this Duke's death he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward Seymour, 9th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]] (1717\\u20131792). He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother [[Webb Seymour, 10th Duke of Somerset|Webb Seymour]] (1718\\u20131793) who became the 10th Duke. His son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 11th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1775\\u20131855) was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his father's death. He changed the family name to St. Maur, but Seymour was still very often used.\\n\\n==12th Duke and sons, the Earls St. Maur==\\n[[Image:12th Duke of Somerset.png|thumb|Edward Seymour]]\\nThe 11th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1804\\u20131885) who was created Earl St. Maur, [[territorial designation|of Berry Pomeroy]] in 1863. His eldest son who predeceased him [[Edward Adolphus Ferdinand Seymour, Earl St. Maur|Edward A. F. Seymour]] (1835\\u20131869) was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted ''Earl St. Maur''. Commonly known as Ferdy, he was an adventurer who joined [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17-year-old maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels, returning to England with her in 1868 to live near [[Brighton]]. Ferdy and Rosina had two children; a girl named [[Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck|Ruth]] (1867\\u20131953) was born whilst the couple were in [[Tangier]] and a boy named Richard 'Harold' St. Maur (1869\\u20131927) was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl [[illegitimate children|married Rosina]], Harold would have been the heir to his grandfather's dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands, offering reward of \\u00a350 (equal to about \\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1885|r=-3}}}} today){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for evidence to support the claim, but was unsuccessful.\\n\\n==13th\\u201319th dukes==\\nThe 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother [[Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour, 13th Duke of Somerset|Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour]] (1810\\u20131891). When he died a few years later, the youngest brother [[Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur, 14th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur]] (1813\\u20131894) became the 14th Duke.<ref>Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, ed.

His son [[Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Seymour]] (1846\\u20131923) became the 15th Duke.\\n\\nHe died without children and the title passed to his distant cousin [[Edward Hamilton Seymour, 16th Duke of Somerset|Edward Hamilton Seymour]] (1860\\u20131931), great-great-grandson of [[Lord Francis Seymour]], [[Dean of Wells]] (1726\\u20131799), youngest son of the 8th Duke. He was succeeded by his son [[Evelyn Francis Seymour, 17th Duke of Somerset|Evelyn Francis Seymour]] (1882\\u20131954) who passed the title on to his son [[Percy Hamilton Seymour, 18th Duke of Somerset|Percy Hamilton Seymour]] (1910\\u20131984). The title is currently held by his son [[John Michael Edward Seymour, 19th Duke of Somerset|John Michael Edward Seymour]] who was born in 1952.

It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use [[3D computer graphics]] overlaid on [[Rendering (computer graphics)|pre-rendered]] static backgrounds. As with other [[LucasArts adventure games]], the player must converse with characters and examine, collect, and use objects to solve puzzles.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' is set in the Land of the Dead and the [[retro-futuristic]] version of the 1950s, through which recently departed souls, represented as ''[[calaca]]''-like figures, travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" [[Calavera]] as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the [[Aztec religion#Cosmology and ritual|Aztec afterlife]] with ''[[film noir]]'' style, with influences including ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the greatest video games of all time]]. However, it was a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]] and contributed towards LucasArts' decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre.\\n\\nIn 2014, with help from [[Sony]], Schafer's studio [[Double Fine Productions]] acquired the ''Grim Fandango'' license following [[Disney]]'s acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. Double Fine produced a remastered version of the game, featuring improved character graphics, controls (including point and click), an orchestrated score, and directors' commentary. It was released for [[Linux]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and Windows in January 2015, for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] in May 2015, for [[Nintendo Switch]] in November 2018, and for [[Xbox One]] in October 2020.\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\n''Grim Fandango'' is an [[adventure game]], in which the player controls Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" Calavera (''[[calavera]]'' being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the [[GrimE]] engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from [[3D model]]s, while the main objects and characters are animated in [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name=\\\"bwire080997\\\" /> Additionally, cutscenes in the game have also been pre-rendered in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], a [[joystick]], or a [[gamepad]]. The remastered edition allows control via a [[computer mouse|mouse]] as well. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve [[puzzle]]s and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head toward that object or person as he walks by.<ref name=\\\"sfgate review\\\"/> The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in and out of his coat jacket.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer retrospective\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-05-retrospective-grim-fandango |title=Retrospective: Grim Fandango |first=Jeffery |last=Matulef |date=February 5, 2012 |access-date=February 5, 2012 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509093631/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-05-retrospective-grim-fandango |archive-date=May 9, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through [[conversation tree]]s to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot.<ref name=\\\"manual\\\">{{cite book |title=Grim Fandango Instruction Manual |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |year=1998 |url=http://www.brainygamer.com/VGC/GrimManual.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043524/http://www.brainygamer.com/VGC/GrimManual.pdf |archive-date=September 15, 2012 |access-date=October 11, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never [[game over|die]] or otherwise get into a [[no-win situation#Video games|no-win situation]] (that prevents completion of the game).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |title=The Greatest Games of All Time: Day of the Tentacle |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=April 30, 2004 |access-date=March 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402084445/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |archive-date=April 2, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\n== Synopsis ==\\n=== Setting ===\\n''Grim Fandango'' takes place in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld) on the Four Year Journey of the Soul.

Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs and stay in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the [[Grim Reaper]] to escort the souls from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the [[Day of the Dead]], these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.<ref name=\\\"manual\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Schafer design diary\\\"/>\\n\\nThe souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal ''calaca'' figures.<ref name=\\\"Schafer design diary\\\"/> Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of day-to-day life, such as vehicle maintenance and even drink service.

Manny steals a client, Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, from his successful co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the \\\"Number Nine\\\" luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Manny''': Meche.

Don Copal uses it as a reason to arrest Manny. Manny was freed from arrest and sprouting by Salvador \\\"Sal\\\" Limones, the leader of the small underground organization the Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who warns him of Domino and Don rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Salvador''': I was once a reaper like yourself Manuel, but I uncovered a web of corruption in our beloved Department of Death.

Sal recruits Manny to help LSA by setting up a system of [[pigeon mail]] and providing the group with [[biometrics]] of Manny in order to access the computer systems of the Department. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to arrive.\\n\\n[[Image:Grim-fandango-cast.jpg|left|thumb|The cast of ''Grim Fandango''.

Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny sees Meche leaving the port with Domino, but when he tries to stop them, he himself was stopped by Meche. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda, the owner of the beatnik Blue Casket nightclub, that Don has been sprouted for letting the scandal be known.\\n\\nManny gives chase, manages to get on a board of leaving ship as a janitor, and a year later (after being promoted to a captain) tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Meche''': You were headed for a trap, I was trying to warn you. Domino was using me like bait. I didn't want you to end up a prisoner here like me.}}</ref> All of Domino's clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor, both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hector's scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and a few of the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.\\n\\nThe three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. The Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won't let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them, and it's further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or stolen Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train (which sends all souls on board to hell).

Under new management, LucasArts licensed several of its [[intellectual property|intellectual properties]] (IP), including ''Grim Fandango'', to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\"/> Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island#2009 rerelease|The Secret of Monkey Island]]''.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\"/> Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from LucasArts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and [[platform evangelism|developer relations]] [[Adam Boyes (entrepreneur)|Adam Boyes]], was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} after seeing developers like [[Capcom]] and [[Midway Games]] revive older properties. Boyes' determination was supported by John Vignocchi, VP of Production for [[Disney Interactive]], who also shared memories of the game, and was able to bring in contacts to track down the game's assets.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> After discovering they were vying for the same property, Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding, planning to make the re-release a remastered version.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-24-bringing-out-the-dead-tim-schafer-reflects-back-on-grim-fandango |title=Bringing out the Dead: Tim Schafer reflects back on Grim Fandango |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=January 26, 2015 |access-date=January 26, 2015 |first=Jeffrey |last=Matulef |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128094744/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-24-bringing-out-the-dead-tim-schafer-reflects-back-on-grim-fandango |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/27/7921837/grim-fandango-remastered-interview-double-fine-disney-lucasfilm-sony |title=Digital Archeology: How Double Fine, Disney, Lucasarts and Sony Resurrected Grim Fandango |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Dave |last=Tach |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128123552/http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/27/7921837/grim-fandango-remastered-interview-double-fine-disney-lucasfilm-sony |archive-date=January 28, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game, instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support, similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/>\\n\\n====Challenges====\\n[[File:Grim fandango remastered comparison.png|thumb|right|A comparison of ''Grim Fandango'' from its original release (top) and the remastered version. Double Fine increased texture resolution and improved lighting models to improve the looks of the characters.]]\\n\\nA major complication in remastering the original work was having many of the critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer [[Jory Prum]] had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nSchafer noted at the time of ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} original development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present-day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/> In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nOnce original assets were identified, as to be used to present the \\\"classic\\\" look of the game in the Remastered edition, Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers. The textures and lighting models for the characters were improved, in particular for Manny.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> Schafer has likened the remastering approach to [[The Criterion Collection]] film releases in providing a high-fidelity version of the game without changing the story or the characters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Diver |first1=Mike |title=Tim Schafer Discusses the Classic Video Games 'Grim Fandango' and 'Monkey Island' |url=https://www.vice.com/read/tim-schafer-discusses-grim-fandango-and-monkey-island-990 |website=VICE |access-date=February 2, 2015 |date=January 27, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130043109/http://www.vice.com/read/tim-schafer-discusses-grim-fandango-and-monkey-island-990 |archive-date=January 30, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\nIn addition to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created [[unofficial patch]]es and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in [[ResidualVM]], and gained their help to improve the game's assets for the remastered version.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/06/10/a-closer-look-at-grim-fandangos-surprise-revival |title=A Closer Look at Grim Fandango's Surprise Revival |first=Asif |last=Siddiky |publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]] |date=June 10, 2014 |access-date=June 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813064108/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/06/10/a-closer-look-at-grim-fandangos-surprise-revival/ |archive-date=August 13, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-remastered-grim-fandango-heading-to-ps4-vita/1100-6420283/ |title=E3 2014: Remastered Grim Fandango heading to PS4, Vita - Tim Schafer's classic adventure game headed to current-gen Sony consoles. |last1=Ramsay |first1=Randolph |date=June 9, 2014 |website=GameSpot |access-date=October 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002172725/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-remastered-grim-fandango-heading-to-ps4-vita/1100-6420283/ |archive-date=October 2, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=5 things from E3 Sony PS event |first=Brett |last=Molina |newspaper=USA Today |date=June 11, 2014 |page=5B \\u2013 Money Section}}</ref> One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game's movement controls from the [[tank controls]] to a [[point and click]]-style interface.

The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 4:3 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's ''[[Broken Age]]''). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game.

Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an auto-save system, as well as the game not receiving a full high-definition upgrade, leaving the higher-resolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"gamespot rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"ign rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/> Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles, though a staple of the day when ''Grim Fandango'' was first released, remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them, and that a hint system, as was added to the ''Monkey Island'' remake, would have been very helpful.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: it's worth admiring this lovingly restored antique |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Oliver |last=Cragg |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206185431/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |archive-date=February 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/02/03/grim-fandango-remastered-review-a-witty-but-tedious-classic/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: A witty but tedious classic |first=Christopher |last=Byrd |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> The game's pacing, also unchanged from the original version, was also found harder to grasp, in both the pacing within the game's four acts, and the time taken to move around and between rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered is a flawed remake of a considered masterpiece |website=Ars Technica |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Steven |last=Strom |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128021850/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref> In his review for [[Eurogamer]], Richard Cobbett warned players to \\\"be careful of rose-tinted memories\\\", that while the remastered version is faithful to the original, it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in video game development.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'s}} Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was \\\"an artifact of its time, an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing\\\".<ref name=\\\"wired rm review\\\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered/ |title=I Love You, Grim Fandango, Even Though You're Broken |first=Laura |last=Hudson |date=January 29, 2015 |access-date=January 29, 2015 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201130938/http://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered |archive-date=February 1, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n==Legacy==\\nIn 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' characterized the game as \\\"the last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer's noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead.

He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. One option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]].<ref>{{cite web

He was famous for his comic and character roles [[Stanley Holloway on stage and screen|on stage and screen]], especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. He was also renowned for his [[Songs and monologues of Stanley Holloway|comic monologues and songs]], which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.\\n\\nBorn in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in ''[[Kissing Time]]'' when the musical transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1921, he joined a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]], ''[[The Co-Optimists]]'', and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by [[Marriott Edgar]], were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in [[variety show|variety]], [[pantomime]] and musical comedy, including several [[revue]]s.\\n\\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Path\\u00e9 News]] and took character parts in a series of films including ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'', ''[[The Way Ahead]]'', ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' and ''[[The Way to the Stars]]''. In the decade after the war, he appeared in the film ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' and ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]''.\\n\\nIn 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in ''My Fair Lady'', a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version in 1964]]. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor [[Julian Holloway]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\n\\n===Family background and early life===\\nHolloway was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]], [[Essex]] (now in the [[London Borough of Newham]]), on 1 October 1890.

It is particularly associated with two families: the Beauforts, who held the title from the creation of 1448, and the Seymours, from the creation of 1547, in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique, in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Kingdom of England]], using a power granted in the will of his nephew [[King Edward VI]].\\n\\nThe only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is '''Baron Seymour''', which is used as a [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles, yet the holder's [[Order of precedence|precedence]] is higher than his title suggests, by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset (the only more senior non-royal duke is the [[Duke of Norfolk]]).\\n\\nSeveral other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset, but have become extinct. These include: [[Earl of Kendal]] (created 1443, extinct 1444), [[Earl of Somerset]] (created 1397, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Dorset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399; created 1442, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Somerset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399), [[Earl of Dorset]] (created 1441, forfeit 1461), ''Viscount Rochester'' (created 1611, extinct 1645), ''Viscount Beauchamp of Hache'' (created 1536, forfeit 1552), [[Earl of Hertford]] (created 1537, forfeit 1552; and created 1559, extinct 1750), [[Marquess of Hertford]] (created 1640, extinct 1675), [[Baron Seymour of Trowbridge]] (created 1641, extinct 1750), [[Baron Percy]] (created 1722, separated 1750), ''[[Baron Cockermouth]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), ''[[Earl of Egremont]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), and ''Earl St. Maur'' (created 1863, extinct 1885).\\n\\nThe ducal seat is [[Bradley House (Wiltshire)|Bradley House]] in [[Maiden Bradley]], west [[Wiltshire]], with a secondary estate at [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]], [[Totnes]], [[Devon]]. The principal burial place for the Seymour family today is [[All Saints' Church, Maiden Bradley]], adjacent to Bradley House; the church and the family cemetery can be reached from the grounds of Bradley House via private access.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/maidenbradley/maiden-bradley-times/duke-s-grave The grave of Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset], 19 July 2013</ref>\\n\\n==Creation of Empress Matilda==\\n[[William de Mohun of Dunster]] (?\\u2013c. 1155), a favourite of [[Empress Matilda]] and a loyal supporter of her in the war against [[Stephen I of England|King Stephen]] (during which he earned the epithet of the \\\"Scourge of the West\\\"), was given the title Earl of Somerset in 1141.

The patent of the dukedom specified that it was to descend to his issue by his second wife Anne Stanhope, thus excluding his eldest son by his first wife from the title, except in case of the failure of male heirs from the junior line. In 1547 he bought [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon from Sir Thomas Pomeroy,  although he probably never visited it, and it became the seat of his eldest son from his first marriage, Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593), whose son was made a [[Seymour baronets|baronet \\\"of Berry Pomeroy\\\"]].

She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch (1711\\u20131773), daughter of [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham]]. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748, at [[Petworth House]], [[Sussex]]<ref name=\\\"6th\\\"/> at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Seymour]] (1684\\u20131750).\\n\\n;Later subsidiary titles\\nAlgernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749, the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Hugh Smithson]], husband of Algernon's daughter Elizabeth Seymour (bef. 1730\\u20131776), whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister, Lady Catherine Seymour (1693\\u20131731). Without male issue, on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford, the barony of Beauchamp, and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct; and the dukedom of Somerset, together with the barony of Seymour, devolved on his distant cousin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://familytrees.genopro.com/ralphballard/default.htm?page=BaronPercy7thDukeOfSomers-Algernon-ind00244.htm | title=Algernon Baron Percy, 7th Duke of Somerset, Earl of Northumberland | publisher=Moore, Simpson, Ballard Family Tree \\u2013 England and Scotland to Australia | access-date=27 December 2010}}</ref>\\n\\n;Later descent\\nSir [[Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy]] (1694\\u20131757) became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750. The 1st baronet was (Sir) Edward Seymour (1556\\u20131613), son of Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593) who was the 1st Duke's eldest son and of Catherine Seymour (n\\u00e9e Filliol). He was a seventh-generation descendant of the 1st Duke. The 4th Baronet had been speaker of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and he moved the family home from [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon to Bradley House in [[Maiden Bradley]].<ref>Report and Transactions of The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and the Arts.

He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother [[Webb Seymour, 10th Duke of Somerset|Webb Seymour]] (1718\\u20131793) who became the 10th Duke. His son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 11th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1775\\u20131855) was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his father's death. He changed the family name to St. Maur, but Seymour was still very often used.\\n\\n==12th Duke and sons, the Earls St. Maur==\\n[[Image:12th Duke of Somerset.png|thumb|Edward Seymour]]\\nThe 11th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1804\\u20131885) who was created Earl St. Maur, [[territorial designation|of Berry Pomeroy]] in 1863. His eldest son who predeceased him [[Edward Adolphus Ferdinand Seymour, Earl St. Maur|Edward A. F. Seymour]] (1835\\u20131869) was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted ''Earl St. Maur''. Commonly known as Ferdy, he was an adventurer who joined [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17-year-old maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels, returning to England with her in 1868 to live near [[Brighton]]. Ferdy and Rosina had two children; a girl named [[Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck|Ruth]] (1867\\u20131953) was born whilst the couple were in [[Tangier]] and a boy named Richard 'Harold' St. Maur (1869\\u20131927) was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl [[illegitimate children|married Rosina]], Harold would have been the heir to his grandfather's dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands, offering reward of \\u00a350 (equal to about \\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1885|r=-3}}}} today){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for evidence to support the claim, but was unsuccessful.\\n\\n==13th\\u201319th dukes==\\nThe 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother [[Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour, 13th Duke of Somerset|Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour]] (1810\\u20131891). When he died a few years later, the youngest brother [[Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur, 14th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur]] (1813\\u20131894) became the 14th Duke.<ref>Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, ed.

He was succeeded by his son [[Evelyn Francis Seymour, 17th Duke of Somerset|Evelyn Francis Seymour]] (1882\\u20131954) who passed the title on to his son [[Percy Hamilton Seymour, 18th Duke of Somerset|Percy Hamilton Seymour]] (1910\\u20131984).
