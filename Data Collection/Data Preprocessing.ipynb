It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use [[3D computer graphics]] overlaid on [[Rendering (computer graphics)|pre-rendered]] static backgrounds. As with other [[LucasArts adventure games]], the player must converse with characters and examine, collect, and use objects to solve puzzles.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' is set in the Land of the Dead and the [[retro-futuristic]] version of the 1950s, through which recently departed souls, represented as ''[[calaca]]''-like figures, travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" [[Calavera]] as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the [[Aztec religion#Cosmology and ritual|Aztec afterlife]] with ''[[film noir]]'' style, with influences including ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the greatest video games of all time]]. However, it was a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]] and contributed towards LucasArts' decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre.\\n\\nIn 2014, with help from [[Sony]], Schafer's studio [[Double Fine Productions]] acquired the ''Grim Fandango'' license following [[Disney]]'s acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. Double Fine produced a remastered version of the game, featuring improved character graphics, controls (including point and click), an orchestrated score, and directors' commentary. It was released for [[Linux]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and Windows in January 2015, for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] in May 2015, for [[Nintendo Switch]] in November 2018, and for [[Xbox One]] in October 2020.\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\n''Grim Fandango'' is an [[adventure game]], in which the player controls Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" Calavera (''[[calavera]]'' being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the [[GrimE]] engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from [[3D model]]s, while the main objects and characters are animated in [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name=\\\"bwire080997\\\" /> Additionally, cutscenes in the game have also been pre-rendered in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], a [[joystick]], or a [[gamepad]]. The remastered edition allows control via a [[computer mouse|mouse]] as well. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve [[puzzle]]s and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head toward that object or person as he walks by.<ref name=\\\"sfgate review\\\"/> The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in and out of his coat jacket.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer retrospective\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-05-retrospective-grim-fandango |title=Retrospective: Grim Fandango |first=Jeffery |last=Matulef |date=February 5, 2012 |access-date=February 5, 2012 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509093631/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-05-retrospective-grim-fandango |archive-date=May 9, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through [[conversation tree]]s to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot.<ref name=\\\"manual\\\">{{cite book |title=Grim Fandango Instruction Manual |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |year=1998 |url=http://www.brainygamer.com/VGC/GrimManual.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043524/http://www.brainygamer.com/VGC/GrimManual.pdf |archive-date=September 15, 2012 |access-date=October 11, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never [[game over|die]] or otherwise get into a [[no-win situation#Video games|no-win situation]] (that prevents completion of the game).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |title=The Greatest Games of All Time: Day of the Tentacle |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=April 30, 2004 |access-date=March 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402084445/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |archive-date=April 2, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\n== Synopsis ==\\n=== Setting ===\\n''Grim Fandango'' takes place in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld) on the Four Year Journey of the Soul.

It shoots straight to the Ninth Underworld, the land of eternal rest in four minutes instead of four years.}}</ref> However, souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs and stay in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the [[Grim Reaper]] to escort the souls from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the [[Day of the Dead]], these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.<ref name=\\\"manual\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Schafer design diary\\\"/>\\n\\nThe souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal ''calaca'' figures.<ref name=\\\"Schafer design diary\\\"/> Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of day-to-day life, such as vehicle maintenance and even drink service.

Manny steals a client, Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, from his successful co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the \\\"Number Nine\\\" luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Manny''': Meche.

It was spotless!&nbsp;... at least the part I read was.}}</ref> When Manny went to his boss while asking Meche to wait for him fixing the issue, Meche starts her journey on foot herself. Don Copal uses it as a reason to arrest Manny. Manny was freed from arrest and sprouting by Salvador \\\"Sal\\\" Limones, the leader of the small underground organization the Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who warns him of Domino and Don rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Salvador''': I was once a reaper like yourself Manuel, but I uncovered a web of corruption in our beloved Department of Death.

Sal recruits Manny to help LSA by setting up a system of [[pigeon mail]] and providing the group with [[biometrics]] of Manny in order to access the computer systems of the Department. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to arrive.\\n\\n[[Image:Grim-fandango-cast.jpg|left|thumb|The cast of ''Grim Fandango''.

Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny sees Meche leaving the port with Domino, but when he tries to stop them, he himself was stopped by Meche. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda, the owner of the beatnik Blue Casket nightclub, that Don has been sprouted for letting the scandal be known.\\n\\nManny gives chase, manages to get on a board of leaving ship as a janitor, and a year later (after being promoted to a captain) tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Meche''': You were headed for a trap, I was trying to warn you. Domino was using me like bait. I didn't want you to end up a prisoner here like me.}}</ref> All of Domino's clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor, both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hector's scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and a few of the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.\\n\\nThe three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. The Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won't let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them, and it's further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or stolen Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train (which sends all souls on board to hell). Meanwhile, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned.

Under new management, LucasArts licensed several of its [[intellectual property|intellectual properties]] (IP), including ''Grim Fandango'', to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\"/> Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island#2009 rerelease|The Secret of Monkey Island]]''.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\"/> Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from LucasArts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and [[platform evangelism|developer relations]] [[Adam Boyes (entrepreneur)|Adam Boyes]], was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} after seeing developers like [[Capcom]] and [[Midway Games]] revive older properties. Boyes' determination was supported by John Vignocchi, VP of Production for [[Disney Interactive]], who also shared memories of the game, and was able to bring in contacts to track down the game's assets.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> After discovering they were vying for the same property, Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding, planning to make the re-release a remastered version.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-24-bringing-out-the-dead-tim-schafer-reflects-back-on-grim-fandango |title=Bringing out the Dead: Tim Schafer reflects back on Grim Fandango |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=January 26, 2015 |access-date=January 26, 2015 |first=Jeffrey |last=Matulef |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128094744/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-24-bringing-out-the-dead-tim-schafer-reflects-back-on-grim-fandango |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/27/7921837/grim-fandango-remastered-interview-double-fine-disney-lucasfilm-sony |title=Digital Archeology: How Double Fine, Disney, Lucasarts and Sony Resurrected Grim Fandango |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Dave |last=Tach |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128123552/http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/27/7921837/grim-fandango-remastered-interview-double-fine-disney-lucasfilm-sony |archive-date=January 28, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game, instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support, similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/>\\n\\n====Challenges====\\n[[File:Grim fandango remastered comparison.png|thumb|right|A comparison of ''Grim Fandango'' from its original release (top) and the remastered version. Double Fine increased texture resolution and improved lighting models to improve the looks of the characters.]]\\n\\nA major complication in remastering the original work was having many of the critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer [[Jory Prum]] had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nSchafer noted at the time of ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} original development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present-day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/> In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nOnce original assets were identified, as to be used to present the \\\"classic\\\" look of the game in the Remastered edition, Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers. The textures and lighting models for the characters were improved, in particular for Manny.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> Schafer has likened the remastering approach to [[The Criterion Collection]] film releases in providing a high-fidelity version of the game without changing the story or the characters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Diver |first1=Mike |title=Tim Schafer Discusses the Classic Video Games 'Grim Fandango' and 'Monkey Island' |url=https://www.vice.com/read/tim-schafer-discusses-grim-fandango-and-monkey-island-990 |website=VICE |access-date=February 2, 2015 |date=January 27, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130043109/http://www.vice.com/read/tim-schafer-discusses-grim-fandango-and-monkey-island-990 |archive-date=January 30, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\nIn addition to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created [[unofficial patch]]es and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in [[ResidualVM]], and gained their help to improve the game's assets for the remastered version.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/06/10/a-closer-look-at-grim-fandangos-surprise-revival |title=A Closer Look at Grim Fandango's Surprise Revival |first=Asif |last=Siddiky |publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]] |date=June 10, 2014 |access-date=June 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813064108/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/06/10/a-closer-look-at-grim-fandangos-surprise-revival/ |archive-date=August 13, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-remastered-grim-fandango-heading-to-ps4-vita/1100-6420283/ |title=E3 2014: Remastered Grim Fandango heading to PS4, Vita - Tim Schafer's classic adventure game headed to current-gen Sony consoles. |last1=Ramsay |first1=Randolph |date=June 9, 2014 |website=GameSpot |access-date=October 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002172725/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-remastered-grim-fandango-heading-to-ps4-vita/1100-6420283/ |archive-date=October 2, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=5 things from E3 Sony PS event |first=Brett |last=Molina |newspaper=USA Today |date=June 11, 2014 |page=5B \\u2013 Money Section}}</ref> One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game's movement controls from the [[tank controls]] to a [[point and click]]-style interface.

The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 4:3 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's ''[[Broken Age]]''). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game.

Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an auto-save system, as well as the game not receiving a full high-definition upgrade, leaving the higher-resolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"gamespot rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"ign rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/> Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles, though a staple of the day when ''Grim Fandango'' was first released, remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them, and that a hint system, as was added to the ''Monkey Island'' remake, would have been very helpful.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: it's worth admiring this lovingly restored antique |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Oliver |last=Cragg |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206185431/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |archive-date=February 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/02/03/grim-fandango-remastered-review-a-witty-but-tedious-classic/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: A witty but tedious classic |first=Christopher |last=Byrd |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> The game's pacing, also unchanged from the original version, was also found harder to grasp, in both the pacing within the game's four acts, and the time taken to move around and between rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered is a flawed remake of a considered masterpiece |website=Ars Technica |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Steven |last=Strom |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128021850/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref> In his review for [[Eurogamer]], Richard Cobbett warned players to \\\"be careful of rose-tinted memories\\\", that while the remastered version is faithful to the original, it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in video game development.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'s}} Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was \\\"an artifact of its time, an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing\\\".<ref name=\\\"wired rm review\\\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered/ |title=I Love You, Grim Fandango, Even Though You're Broken |first=Laura |last=Hudson |date=January 29, 2015 |access-date=January 29, 2015 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201130938/http://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered |archive-date=February 1, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n==Legacy==\\nIn 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' characterized the game as \\\"the last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer's noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead.

He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. One option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]].<ref>{{cite web

He was famous for his comic and character roles [[Stanley Holloway on stage and screen|on stage and screen]], especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. He was also renowned for his [[Songs and monologues of Stanley Holloway|comic monologues and songs]], which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.\\n\\nBorn in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in ''[[Kissing Time]]'' when the musical transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1921, he joined a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]], ''[[The Co-Optimists]]'', and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by [[Marriott Edgar]], were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in [[variety show|variety]], [[pantomime]] and musical comedy, including several [[revue]]s.\\n\\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Path\\u00e9 News]] and took character parts in a series of films including ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'', ''[[The Way Ahead]]'', ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' and ''[[The Way to the Stars]]''. In the decade after the war, he appeared in the film ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' and ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]''.\\n\\nIn 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in ''My Fair Lady'', a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version in 1964]]. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor [[Julian Holloway]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\n\\n===Family background and early life===\\nHolloway was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]], [[Essex]] (now in the [[London Borough of Newham]]), on 1 October 1890.

It is particularly associated with two families: the Beauforts, who held the title from the creation of 1448, and the Seymours, from the creation of 1547, in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique, in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Kingdom of England]], using a power granted in the will of his nephew [[King Edward VI]].\\n\\nThe only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is '''Baron Seymour''', which is used as a [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles, yet the holder's [[Order of precedence|precedence]] is higher than his title suggests, by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset (the only more senior non-royal duke is the [[Duke of Norfolk]]).\\n\\nSeveral other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset, but have become extinct. These include: [[Earl of Kendal]] (created 1443, extinct 1444), [[Earl of Somerset]] (created 1397, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Dorset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399; created 1442, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Somerset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399), [[Earl of Dorset]] (created 1441, forfeit 1461), ''Viscount Rochester'' (created 1611, extinct 1645), ''Viscount Beauchamp of Hache'' (created 1536, forfeit 1552), [[Earl of Hertford]] (created 1537, forfeit 1552; and created 1559, extinct 1750), [[Marquess of Hertford]] (created 1640, extinct 1675), [[Baron Seymour of Trowbridge]] (created 1641, extinct 1750), [[Baron Percy]] (created 1722, separated 1750), ''[[Baron Cockermouth]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), ''[[Earl of Egremont]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), and ''Earl St. Maur'' (created 1863, extinct 1885).\\n\\nThe ducal seat is [[Bradley House (Wiltshire)|Bradley House]] in [[Maiden Bradley]], west [[Wiltshire]], with a secondary estate at [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]], [[Totnes]], [[Devon]]. The principal burial place for the Seymour family today is [[All Saints' Church, Maiden Bradley]], adjacent to Bradley House; the church and the family cemetery can be reached from the grounds of Bradley House via private access.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/maidenbradley/maiden-bradley-times/duke-s-grave The grave of Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset], 19 July 2013</ref>\\n\\n==Creation of Empress Matilda==\\n[[William de Mohun of Dunster]] (?\\u2013c. 1155), a favourite of [[Empress Matilda]] and a loyal supporter of her in the war against [[Stephen I of England|King Stephen]] (during which he earned the epithet of the \\\"Scourge of the West\\\"), was given the title Earl of Somerset in 1141.

The patent of the dukedom specified that it was to descend to his issue by his second wife Anne Stanhope, thus excluding his eldest son by his first wife from the title, except in case of the failure of male heirs from the junior line. In 1547 he bought [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon from Sir Thomas Pomeroy,  although he probably never visited it, and it became the seat of his eldest son from his first marriage, Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593), whose son was made a [[Seymour baronets|baronet \\\"of Berry Pomeroy\\\"]].

She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch (1711\\u20131773), daughter of [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham]]. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748, at [[Petworth House]], [[Sussex]]<ref name=\\\"6th\\\"/> at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Seymour]] (1684\\u20131750).\\n\\n;Later subsidiary titles\\nAlgernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749, the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Hugh Smithson]], husband of Algernon's daughter Elizabeth Seymour (bef. 1730\\u20131776), whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister, Lady Catherine Seymour (1693\\u20131731). Without male issue, on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford, the barony of Beauchamp, and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct; and the dukedom of Somerset, together with the barony of Seymour, devolved on his distant cousin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://familytrees.genopro.com/ralphballard/default.htm?page=BaronPercy7thDukeOfSomers-Algernon-ind00244.htm | title=Algernon Baron Percy, 7th Duke of Somerset, Earl of Northumberland | publisher=Moore, Simpson, Ballard Family Tree \\u2013 England and Scotland to Australia | access-date=27 December 2010}}</ref>\\n\\n;Later descent\\nSir [[Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy]] (1694\\u20131757) became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750. The 1st baronet was (Sir) Edward Seymour (1556\\u20131613), son of Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593) who was the 1st Duke's eldest son and of Catherine Seymour (n\\u00e9e Filliol). He was a seventh-generation descendant of the 1st Duke. The 4th Baronet had been speaker of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and he moved the family home from [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon to Bradley House in [[Maiden Bradley]].<ref>Report and Transactions of The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and the Arts. Vol 133 (2001), p 11-12.</ref>\\n\\nUpon this Duke's death he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward Seymour, 9th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]] (1717\\u20131792). He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother [[Webb Seymour, 10th Duke of Somerset|Webb Seymour]] (1718\\u20131793) who became the 10th Duke. His son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 11th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1775\\u20131855) was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his father's death. He changed the family name to St. Maur, but Seymour was still very often used.\\n\\n==12th Duke and sons, the Earls St. Maur==\\n[[Image:12th Duke of Somerset.png|thumb|Edward Seymour]]\\nThe 11th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1804\\u20131885) who was created Earl St. Maur, [[territorial designation|of Berry Pomeroy]] in 1863. His eldest son who predeceased him [[Edward Adolphus Ferdinand Seymour, Earl St. Maur|Edward A. F. Seymour]] (1835\\u20131869) was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted ''Earl St. Maur''. Commonly known as Ferdy, he was an adventurer who joined [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17-year-old maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels, returning to England with her in 1868 to live near [[Brighton]]. Ferdy and Rosina had two children; a girl named [[Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck|Ruth]] (1867\\u20131953) was born whilst the couple were in [[Tangier]] and a boy named Richard 'Harold' St. Maur (1869\\u20131927) was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl [[illegitimate children|married Rosina]], Harold would have been the heir to his grandfather's dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands, offering reward of \\u00a350 (equal to about \\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1885|r=-3}}}} today){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for evidence to support the claim, but was unsuccessful.\\n\\n==13th\\u201319th dukes==\\nThe 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother [[Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour, 13th Duke of Somerset|Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour]] (1810\\u20131891). When he died a few years later, the youngest brother [[Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur, 14th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur]] (1813\\u20131894) became the 14th Duke.<ref>Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, ed.

His son [[Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Seymour]] (1846\\u20131923) became the 15th Duke.\\n\\nHe died without children and the title passed to his distant cousin [[Edward Hamilton Seymour, 16th Duke of Somerset|Edward Hamilton Seymour]] (1860\\u20131931), great-great-grandson of [[Lord Francis Seymour]], [[Dean of Wells]] (1726\\u20131799), youngest son of the 8th Duke. He was succeeded by his son [[Evelyn Francis Seymour, 17th Duke of Somerset|Evelyn Francis Seymour]] (1882\\u20131954) who passed the title on to his son [[Percy Hamilton Seymour, 18th Duke of Somerset|Percy Hamilton Seymour]] (1910\\u20131984). The title is currently held by his son [[John Michael Edward Seymour, 19th Duke of Somerset|John Michael Edward Seymour]] who was born in 1952.

It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use [[3D computer graphics]] overlaid on [[Rendering (computer graphics)|pre-rendered]] static backgrounds. As with other [[LucasArts adventure games]], the player must converse with characters and examine, collect, and use objects to solve puzzles.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' is set in the Land of the Dead and the [[retro-futuristic]] version of the 1950s, through which recently departed souls, represented as ''[[calaca]]''-like figures, travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" [[Calavera]] as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the [[Aztec religion#Cosmology and ritual|Aztec afterlife]] with ''[[film noir]]'' style, with influences including ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the greatest video games of all time]]. However, it was a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]] and contributed towards LucasArts' decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre.\\n\\nIn 2014, with help from [[Sony]], Schafer's studio [[Double Fine Productions]] acquired the ''Grim Fandango'' license following [[Disney]]'s acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. Double Fine produced a remastered version of the game, featuring improved character graphics, controls (including point and click), an orchestrated score, and directors' commentary. It was released for [[Linux]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and Windows in January 2015, for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] in May 2015, for [[Nintendo Switch]] in November 2018, and for [[Xbox One]] in October 2020.\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\n''Grim Fandango'' is an [[adventure game]], in which the player controls Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" Calavera (''[[calavera]]'' being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the [[GrimE]] engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from [[3D model]]s, while the main objects and characters are animated in [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name=\\\"bwire080997\\\" /> Additionally, cutscenes in the game have also been pre-rendered in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], a [[joystick]], or a [[gamepad]]. The remastered edition allows control via a [[computer mouse|mouse]] as well.

Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs and stay in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the [[Grim Reaper]] to escort the souls from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited.

Manny steals a client, Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, from his successful co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the \\\"Number Nine\\\" luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Manny''': Meche.

Don Copal uses it as a reason to arrest Manny. Manny was freed from arrest and sprouting by Salvador \\\"Sal\\\" Limones, the leader of the small underground organization the Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who warns him of Domino and Don rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Salvador''': I was once a reaper like yourself Manuel, but I uncovered a web of corruption in our beloved Department of Death.

Sal recruits Manny to help LSA by setting up a system of [[pigeon mail]] and providing the group with [[biometrics]] of Manny in order to access the computer systems of the Department. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to arrive.\\n\\n[[Image:Grim-fandango-cast.jpg|left|thumb|The cast of ''Grim Fandango''.

Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny sees Meche leaving the port with Domino, but when he tries to stop them, he himself was stopped by Meche. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda, the owner of the beatnik Blue Casket nightclub, that Don has been sprouted for letting the scandal be known.\\n\\nManny gives chase, manages to get on a board of leaving ship as a janitor, and a year later (after being promoted to a captain) tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Meche''': You were headed for a trap, I was trying to warn you.

Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and a few of the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.\\n\\nThe three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. The Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won't let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them, and it's further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or stolen Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train (which sends all souls on board to hell). Meanwhile, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a \\\"rocket\\\" train cart, quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis' life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Mechanics''': We shoot you now like an arrow into the wind.

Manny is able to defeat Hector after Sal sacrifices himself to prevent Olivia from interfering. \\n\\nManny and Meche are able to find the real Double N tickets, including the one that Meche should have received.

Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\"/> Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island#2009 rerelease|The Secret of Monkey Island]]''.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\"/> Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from LucasArts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and [[platform evangelism|developer relations]] [[Adam Boyes (entrepreneur)|Adam Boyes]], was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} after seeing developers like [[Capcom]] and [[Midway Games]] revive older properties.

A large number of backup files were made on [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes.

As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/> In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nOnce original assets were identified, as to be used to present the \\\"classic\\\" look of the game in the Remastered edition, Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers.

Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an auto-save system, as well as the game not receiving a full high-definition upgrade, leaving the higher-resolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"gamespot rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"ign rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/> Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles, though a staple of the day when ''Grim Fandango'' was first released, remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them, and that a hint system, as was added to the ''Monkey Island'' remake, would have been very helpful.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: it's worth admiring this lovingly restored antique |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Oliver |last=Cragg |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206185431/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |archive-date=February 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/02/03/grim-fandango-remastered-review-a-witty-but-tedious-classic/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: A witty but tedious classic |first=Christopher |last=Byrd |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> The game's pacing, also unchanged from the original version, was also found harder to grasp, in both the pacing within the game's four acts, and the time taken to move around and between rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered is a flawed remake of a considered masterpiece |website=Ars Technica |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Steven |last=Strom |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128021850/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref> In his review for [[Eurogamer]], Richard Cobbett warned players to \\\"be careful of rose-tinted memories\\\", that while the remastered version is faithful to the original, it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in video game development.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'s}} Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was \\\"an artifact of its time, an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing\\\".<ref name=\\\"wired rm review\\\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered/ |title=I Love You, Grim Fandango, Even Though You're Broken |first=Laura |last=Hudson |date=January 29, 2015 |access-date=January 29, 2015 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201130938/http://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered |archive-date=February 1, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n==Legacy==\\nIn 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' characterized the game as \\\"the last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer's noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead.

He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. One option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]].<ref>{{cite web

He was famous for his comic and character roles [[Stanley Holloway on stage and screen|on stage and screen]], especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. He was also renowned for his [[Songs and monologues of Stanley Holloway|comic monologues and songs]], which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.\\n\\nBorn in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in ''[[Kissing Time]]'' when the musical transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1921, he joined a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]], ''[[The Co-Optimists]]'', and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by [[Marriott Edgar]], were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in [[variety show|variety]], [[pantomime]] and musical comedy, including several [[revue]]s.\\n\\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Path\\u00e9 News]] and took character parts in a series of films including ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'', ''[[The Way Ahead]]'', ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' and ''[[The Way to the Stars]]''. In the decade after the war, he appeared in the film ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' and ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]''.\\n\\nIn 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in ''My Fair Lady'', a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version in 1964]]. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor [[Julian Holloway]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\n\\n===Family background and early life===\\nHolloway was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]], [[Essex]] (now in the [[London Borough of Newham]]), on 1 October 1890.

It is particularly associated with two families: the Beauforts, who held the title from the creation of 1448, and the Seymours, from the creation of 1547, in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique, in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Kingdom of England]], using a power granted in the will of his nephew [[King Edward VI]].\\n\\nThe only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is '''Baron Seymour''', which is used as a [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles, yet the holder's [[Order of precedence|precedence]] is higher than his title suggests, by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset (the only more senior non-royal duke is the [[Duke of Norfolk]]).\\n\\nSeveral other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset, but have become extinct. These include: [[Earl of Kendal]] (created 1443, extinct 1444), [[Earl of Somerset]] (created 1397, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Dorset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399; created 1442, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Somerset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399), [[Earl of Dorset]] (created 1441, forfeit 1461), ''Viscount Rochester'' (created 1611, extinct 1645), ''Viscount Beauchamp of Hache'' (created 1536, forfeit 1552), [[Earl of Hertford]] (created 1537, forfeit 1552; and created 1559, extinct 1750), [[Marquess of Hertford]] (created 1640, extinct 1675), [[Baron Seymour of Trowbridge]] (created 1641, extinct 1750), [[Baron Percy]] (created 1722, separated 1750), ''[[Baron Cockermouth]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), ''[[Earl of Egremont]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), and ''Earl St. Maur'' (created 1863, extinct 1885).\\n\\nThe ducal seat is [[Bradley House (Wiltshire)|Bradley House]] in [[Maiden Bradley]], west [[Wiltshire]], with a secondary estate at [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]], [[Totnes]], [[Devon]]. The principal burial place for the Seymour family today is [[All Saints' Church, Maiden Bradley]], adjacent to Bradley House; the church and the family cemetery can be reached from the grounds of Bradley House via private access.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/maidenbradley/maiden-bradley-times/duke-s-grave The grave of Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset], 19 July 2013</ref>\\n\\n==Creation of Empress Matilda==\\n[[William de Mohun of Dunster]] (?\\u2013c. 1155), a favourite of [[Empress Matilda]] and a loyal supporter of her in the war against [[Stephen I of England|King Stephen]] (during which he earned the epithet of the \\\"Scourge of the West\\\"), was given the title Earl of Somerset in 1141.

The patent of the dukedom specified that it was to descend to his issue by his second wife Anne Stanhope, thus excluding his eldest son by his first wife from the title, except in case of the failure of male heirs from the junior line. In 1547 he bought [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon from Sir Thomas Pomeroy,  although he probably never visited it, and it became the seat of his eldest son from his first marriage, Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593), whose son was made a [[Seymour baronets|baronet \\\"of Berry Pomeroy\\\"]].

She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch (1711\\u20131773), daughter of [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham]]. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748, at [[Petworth House]], [[Sussex]]<ref name=\\\"6th\\\"/> at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Seymour]] (1684\\u20131750).\\n\\n;Later subsidiary titles\\nAlgernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749, the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Hugh Smithson]], husband of Algernon's daughter Elizabeth Seymour (bef. 1730\\u20131776), whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister, Lady Catherine Seymour (1693\\u20131731). Without male issue, on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford, the barony of Beauchamp, and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct; and the dukedom of Somerset, together with the barony of Seymour, devolved on his distant cousin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://familytrees.genopro.com/ralphballard/default.htm?page=BaronPercy7thDukeOfSomers-Algernon-ind00244.htm | title=Algernon Baron Percy, 7th Duke of Somerset, Earl of Northumberland | publisher=Moore, Simpson, Ballard Family Tree \\u2013 England and Scotland to Australia | access-date=27 December 2010}}</ref>\\n\\n;Later descent\\nSir [[Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy]] (1694\\u20131757) became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750. The 1st baronet was (Sir) Edward Seymour (1556\\u20131613), son of Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593) who was the 1st Duke's eldest son and of Catherine Seymour (n\\u00e9e Filliol). He was a seventh-generation descendant of the 1st Duke. The 4th Baronet had been speaker of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and he moved the family home from [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon to Bradley House in [[Maiden Bradley]].<ref>Report and Transactions of The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and the Arts.

He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother [[Webb Seymour, 10th Duke of Somerset|Webb Seymour]] (1718\\u20131793) who became the 10th Duke. His son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 11th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1775\\u20131855) was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his father's death. He changed the family name to St. Maur, but Seymour was still very often used.\\n\\n==12th Duke and sons, the Earls St. Maur==\\n[[Image:12th Duke of Somerset.png|thumb|Edward Seymour]]\\nThe 11th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1804\\u20131885) who was created Earl St. Maur, [[territorial designation|of Berry Pomeroy]] in 1863. His eldest son who predeceased him [[Edward Adolphus Ferdinand Seymour, Earl St. Maur|Edward A. F. Seymour]] (1835\\u20131869) was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted ''Earl St. Maur''. Commonly known as Ferdy, he was an adventurer who joined [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17-year-old maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels, returning to England with her in 1868 to live near [[Brighton]]. Ferdy and Rosina had two children; a girl named [[Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck|Ruth]] (1867\\u20131953) was born whilst the couple were in [[Tangier]] and a boy named Richard 'Harold' St. Maur (1869\\u20131927) was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl [[illegitimate children|married Rosina]], Harold would have been the heir to his grandfather's dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands, offering reward of \\u00a350 (equal to about \\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1885|r=-3}}}} today){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for evidence to support the claim, but was unsuccessful.\\n\\n==13th\\u201319th dukes==\\nThe 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother [[Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour, 13th Duke of Somerset|Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour]] (1810\\u20131891). When he died a few years later, the youngest brother [[Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur, 14th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur]] (1813\\u20131894) became the 14th Duke.<ref>Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, ed.

He was succeeded by his son [[Evelyn Francis Seymour, 17th Duke of Somerset|Evelyn Francis Seymour]] (1882\\u20131954) who passed the title on to his son [[Percy Hamilton Seymour, 18th Duke of Somerset|Percy Hamilton Seymour]] (1910\\u20131984).

It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use [[3D computer graphics]] overlaid on [[Rendering (computer graphics)|pre-rendered]] static backgrounds. As with other [[LucasArts adventure games]], the player must converse with characters and examine, collect, and use objects to solve puzzles.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' is set in the Land of the Dead and the [[retro-futuristic]] version of the 1950s, through which recently departed souls, represented as ''[[calaca]]''-like figures, travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" [[Calavera]] as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the [[Aztec religion#Cosmology and ritual|Aztec afterlife]] with ''[[film noir]]'' style, with influences including ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the greatest video games of all time]]. However, it was a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]] and contributed towards LucasArts' decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre.\\n\\nIn 2014, with help from [[Sony]], Schafer's studio [[Double Fine Productions]] acquired the ''Grim Fandango'' license following [[Disney]]'s acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. Double Fine produced a remastered version of the game, featuring improved character graphics, controls (including point and click), an orchestrated score, and directors' commentary. It was released for [[Linux]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and Windows in January 2015, for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] in May 2015, for [[Nintendo Switch]] in November 2018, and for [[Xbox One]] in October 2020.\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\n''Grim Fandango'' is an [[adventure game]], in which the player controls Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" Calavera (''[[calavera]]'' being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the [[GrimE]] engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from [[3D model]]s, while the main objects and characters are animated in [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name=\\\"bwire080997\\\" /> Additionally, cutscenes in the game have also been pre-rendered in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], a [[joystick]], or a [[gamepad]]. The remastered edition allows control via a [[computer mouse|mouse]] as well. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve [[puzzle]]s and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head toward that object or person as he walks by.<ref name=\\\"sfgate review\\\"/> The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in and out of his coat jacket.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer retrospective\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-05-retrospective-grim-fandango |title=Retrospective: Grim Fandango |first=Jeffery |last=Matulef |date=February 5, 2012 |access-date=February 5, 2012 |website=[[Eurogamer]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509093631/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-05-retrospective-grim-fandango |archive-date=May 9, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through [[conversation tree]]s to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot.<ref name=\\\"manual\\\">{{cite book |title=Grim Fandango Instruction Manual |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |year=1998 |url=http://www.brainygamer.com/VGC/GrimManual.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915043524/http://www.brainygamer.com/VGC/GrimManual.pdf |archive-date=September 15, 2012 |access-date=October 11, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never [[game over|die]] or otherwise get into a [[no-win situation#Video games|no-win situation]] (that prevents completion of the game).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |title=The Greatest Games of All Time: Day of the Tentacle |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=April 30, 2004 |access-date=March 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402084445/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html |archive-date=April 2, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\n== Synopsis ==\\n=== Setting ===\\n''Grim Fandango'' takes place in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld) on the Four Year Journey of the Soul.

Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs and stay in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the [[Grim Reaper]] to escort the souls from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the [[Day of the Dead]], these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.<ref name=\\\"manual\\\"/><ref name=\\\"Schafer design diary\\\"/>\\n\\nThe souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal ''calaca'' figures.<ref name=\\\"Schafer design diary\\\"/> Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of day-to-day life, such as vehicle maintenance and even drink service.

Manny steals a client, Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, from his successful co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the \\\"Number Nine\\\" luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Manny''': Meche.

Don Copal uses it as a reason to arrest Manny. Manny was freed from arrest and sprouting by Salvador \\\"Sal\\\" Limones, the leader of the small underground organization the Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who warns him of Domino and Don rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Salvador''': I was once a reaper like yourself Manuel, but I uncovered a web of corruption in our beloved Department of Death.

Sal recruits Manny to help LSA by setting up a system of [[pigeon mail]] and providing the group with [[biometrics]] of Manny in order to access the computer systems of the Department. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to arrive.\\n\\n[[Image:Grim-fandango-cast.jpg|left|thumb|The cast of ''Grim Fandango''.

Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny sees Meche leaving the port with Domino, but when he tries to stop them, he himself was stopped by Meche. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda, the owner of the beatnik Blue Casket nightclub, that Don has been sprouted for letting the scandal be known.\\n\\nManny gives chase, manages to get on a board of leaving ship as a janitor, and a year later (after being promoted to a captain) tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World.

Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and a few of the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.\\n\\nThe three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. The Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won't let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them, and it's further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or stolen Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train (which sends all souls on board to hell). Meanwhile, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a \\\"rocket\\\" train cart, quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis' life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Mechanics''': We shoot you now like an arrow into the wind.

Under new management, LucasArts licensed several of its [[intellectual property|intellectual properties]] (IP), including ''Grim Fandango'', to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\"/> Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island#2009 rerelease|The Secret of Monkey Island]]''.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\"/> Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from LucasArts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and [[platform evangelism|developer relations]] [[Adam Boyes (entrepreneur)|Adam Boyes]], was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} after seeing developers like [[Capcom]] and [[Midway Games]] revive older properties. Boyes' determination was supported by John Vignocchi, VP of Production for [[Disney Interactive]], who also shared memories of the game, and was able to bring in contacts to track down the game's assets.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> After discovering they were vying for the same property, Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding, planning to make the re-release a remastered version.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-24-bringing-out-the-dead-tim-schafer-reflects-back-on-grim-fandango |title=Bringing out the Dead: Tim Schafer reflects back on Grim Fandango |website=[[Eurogamer]] |date=January 26, 2015 |access-date=January 26, 2015 |first=Jeffrey |last=Matulef |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128094744/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-24-bringing-out-the-dead-tim-schafer-reflects-back-on-grim-fandango |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/27/7921837/grim-fandango-remastered-interview-double-fine-disney-lucasfilm-sony |title=Digital Archeology: How Double Fine, Disney, Lucasarts and Sony Resurrected Grim Fandango |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Dave |last=Tach |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128123552/http://www.polygon.com/2015/1/27/7921837/grim-fandango-remastered-interview-double-fine-disney-lucasfilm-sony |archive-date=January 28, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game, instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support, similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/>\\n\\n====Challenges====\\n[[File:Grim fandango remastered comparison.png|thumb|right|A comparison of ''Grim Fandango'' from its original release (top) and the remastered version. Double Fine increased texture resolution and improved lighting models to improve the looks of the characters.]]\\n\\nA major complication in remastering the original work was having many of the critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer [[Jory Prum]] had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nSchafer noted at the time of ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} original development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present-day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/> In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nOnce original assets were identified, as to be used to present the \\\"classic\\\" look of the game in the Remastered edition, Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers. The textures and lighting models for the characters were improved, in particular for Manny.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> Schafer has likened the remastering approach to [[The Criterion Collection]] film releases in providing a high-fidelity version of the game without changing the story or the characters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Diver |first1=Mike |title=Tim Schafer Discusses the Classic Video Games 'Grim Fandango' and 'Monkey Island' |url=https://www.vice.com/read/tim-schafer-discusses-grim-fandango-and-monkey-island-990 |website=VICE |access-date=February 2, 2015 |date=January 27, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130043109/http://www.vice.com/read/tim-schafer-discusses-grim-fandango-and-monkey-island-990 |archive-date=January 30, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\nIn addition to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created [[unofficial patch]]es and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in [[ResidualVM]], and gained their help to improve the game's assets for the remastered version.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\">{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/06/10/a-closer-look-at-grim-fandangos-surprise-revival |title=A Closer Look at Grim Fandango's Surprise Revival |first=Asif |last=Siddiky |publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]] |date=June 10, 2014 |access-date=June 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813064108/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/06/10/a-closer-look-at-grim-fandangos-surprise-revival/ |archive-date=August 13, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-remastered-grim-fandango-heading-to-ps4-vita/1100-6420283/ |title=E3 2014: Remastered Grim Fandango heading to PS4, Vita - Tim Schafer's classic adventure game headed to current-gen Sony consoles. |last1=Ramsay |first1=Randolph |date=June 9, 2014 |website=GameSpot |access-date=October 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002172725/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-remastered-grim-fandango-heading-to-ps4-vita/1100-6420283/ |archive-date=October 2, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=5 things from E3 Sony PS event |first=Brett |last=Molina |newspaper=USA Today |date=June 11, 2014 |page=5B \\u2013 Money Section}}</ref> One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game's movement controls from the [[tank controls]] to a [[point and click]]-style interface.

The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 4:3 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's ''[[Broken Age]]''). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game.

Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an auto-save system, as well as the game not receiving a full high-definition upgrade, leaving the higher-resolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"gamespot rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"ign rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/> Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles, though a staple of the day when ''Grim Fandango'' was first released, remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them, and that a hint system, as was added to the ''Monkey Island'' remake, would have been very helpful.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: it's worth admiring this lovingly restored antique |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Oliver |last=Cragg |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206185431/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |archive-date=February 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/02/03/grim-fandango-remastered-review-a-witty-but-tedious-classic/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: A witty but tedious classic |first=Christopher |last=Byrd |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> The game's pacing, also unchanged from the original version, was also found harder to grasp, in both the pacing within the game's four acts, and the time taken to move around and between rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered is a flawed remake of a considered masterpiece |website=Ars Technica |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Steven |last=Strom |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128021850/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref> In his review for [[Eurogamer]], Richard Cobbett warned players to \\\"be careful of rose-tinted memories\\\", that while the remastered version is faithful to the original, it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in video game development.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'s}} Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was \\\"an artifact of its time, an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing\\\".<ref name=\\\"wired rm review\\\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered/ |title=I Love You, Grim Fandango, Even Though You're Broken |first=Laura |last=Hudson |date=January 29, 2015 |access-date=January 29, 2015 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201130938/http://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered |archive-date=February 1, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n==Legacy==\\nIn 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' characterized the game as \\\"the last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer's noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead.

He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. One option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]].<ref>{{cite web

He was famous for his comic and character roles [[Stanley Holloway on stage and screen|on stage and screen]], especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. He was also renowned for his [[Songs and monologues of Stanley Holloway|comic monologues and songs]], which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.\\n\\nBorn in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in ''[[Kissing Time]]'' when the musical transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1921, he joined a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]], ''[[The Co-Optimists]]'', and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by [[Marriott Edgar]], were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in [[variety show|variety]], [[pantomime]] and musical comedy, including several [[revue]]s.\\n\\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Path\\u00e9 News]] and took character parts in a series of films including ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'', ''[[The Way Ahead]]'', ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' and ''[[The Way to the Stars]]''. In the decade after the war, he appeared in the film ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' and ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]''.\\n\\nIn 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in ''My Fair Lady'', a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version in 1964]]. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor [[Julian Holloway]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\n\\n===Family background and early life===\\nHolloway was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]], [[Essex]] (now in the [[London Borough of Newham]]), on 1 October 1890.

It is particularly associated with two families: the Beauforts, who held the title from the creation of 1448, and the Seymours, from the creation of 1547, in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique, in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Kingdom of England]], using a power granted in the will of his nephew [[King Edward VI]].\\n\\nThe only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is '''Baron Seymour''', which is used as a [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles, yet the holder's [[Order of precedence|precedence]] is higher than his title suggests, by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset (the only more senior non-royal duke is the [[Duke of Norfolk]]).\\n\\nSeveral other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset, but have become extinct. These include: [[Earl of Kendal]] (created 1443, extinct 1444), [[Earl of Somerset]] (created 1397, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Dorset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399; created 1442, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Somerset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399), [[Earl of Dorset]] (created 1441, forfeit 1461), ''Viscount Rochester'' (created 1611, extinct 1645), ''Viscount Beauchamp of Hache'' (created 1536, forfeit 1552), [[Earl of Hertford]] (created 1537, forfeit 1552; and created 1559, extinct 1750), [[Marquess of Hertford]] (created 1640, extinct 1675), [[Baron Seymour of Trowbridge]] (created 1641, extinct 1750), [[Baron Percy]] (created 1722, separated 1750), ''[[Baron Cockermouth]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), ''[[Earl of Egremont]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), and ''Earl St. Maur'' (created 1863, extinct 1885).\\n\\nThe ducal seat is [[Bradley House (Wiltshire)|Bradley House]] in [[Maiden Bradley]], west [[Wiltshire]], with a secondary estate at [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]], [[Totnes]], [[Devon]]. The principal burial place for the Seymour family today is [[All Saints' Church, Maiden Bradley]], adjacent to Bradley House; the church and the family cemetery can be reached from the grounds of Bradley House via private access.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/maidenbradley/maiden-bradley-times/duke-s-grave The grave of Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset], 19 July 2013</ref>\\n\\n==Creation of Empress Matilda==\\n[[William de Mohun of Dunster]] (?\\u2013c. 1155), a favourite of [[Empress Matilda]] and a loyal supporter of her in the war against [[Stephen I of England|King Stephen]] (during which he earned the epithet of the \\\"Scourge of the West\\\"), was given the title Earl of Somerset in 1141.

The patent of the dukedom specified that it was to descend to his issue by his second wife Anne Stanhope, thus excluding his eldest son by his first wife from the title, except in case of the failure of male heirs from the junior line. In 1547 he bought [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon from Sir Thomas Pomeroy,  although he probably never visited it, and it became the seat of his eldest son from his first marriage, Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593), whose son was made a [[Seymour baronets|baronet \\\"of Berry Pomeroy\\\"]].

She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch (1711\\u20131773), daughter of [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham]]. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748, at [[Petworth House]], [[Sussex]]<ref name=\\\"6th\\\"/> at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Seymour]] (1684\\u20131750).\\n\\n;Later subsidiary titles\\nAlgernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749, the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Hugh Smithson]], husband of Algernon's daughter Elizabeth Seymour (bef. 1730\\u20131776), whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister, Lady Catherine Seymour (1693\\u20131731). Without male issue, on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford, the barony of Beauchamp, and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct; and the dukedom of Somerset, together with the barony of Seymour, devolved on his distant cousin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://familytrees.genopro.com/ralphballard/default.htm?page=BaronPercy7thDukeOfSomers-Algernon-ind00244.htm | title=Algernon Baron Percy, 7th Duke of Somerset, Earl of Northumberland | publisher=Moore, Simpson, Ballard Family Tree \\u2013 England and Scotland to Australia | access-date=27 December 2010}}</ref>\\n\\n;Later descent\\nSir [[Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy]] (1694\\u20131757) became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750.

His son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 11th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1775\\u20131855) was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his father's death.

His eldest son who predeceased him [[Edward Adolphus Ferdinand Seymour, Earl St. Maur|Edward A. F. Seymour]] (1835\\u20131869) was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted ''Earl St. Maur''. Commonly known as Ferdy, he was an adventurer who joined [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17-year-old maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels, returning to England with her in 1868 to live near [[Brighton]]. Ferdy and Rosina had two children; a girl named [[Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck|Ruth]] (1867\\u20131953) was born whilst the couple were in [[Tangier]] and a boy named Richard 'Harold' St. Maur (1869\\u20131927) was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl [[illegitimate children|married Rosina]], Harold would have been the heir to his grandfather's dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands, offering reward of \\u00a350 (equal to about \\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1885|r=-3}}}} today){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for evidence to support the claim, but was unsuccessful.\\n\\n==13th\\u201319th dukes==\\nThe 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother [[Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour, 13th Duke of Somerset|Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour]] (1810\\u20131891).

It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use 3D computer graphics overlaid on prerendered static backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games the player must converse with characters and examine collect and use objects to solve puzzles. Grim Fandango is set in the Land of the Dead and the retrofuturistic version of the 1950s through which recently departed souls represented as calacalike figures travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel Manny Calavera as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes Meche Colomar a virtuous soul on her journey. The game combines elements of the Aztec afterlife with film noir style with influences including The Maltese Falcon On the Waterfront and Casablanca. Grim Fandango received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as one of the greatest video games of all time. However it was a commercial failure and contributed towards LucasArts decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre. In 2014 with help from Sony Schafers studio Double Fine Productions acquired the Grim Fandango license following Disneys acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. Double Fine produced a remastered version of the game featuring improved character graphics controls including point and click an orchestrated score and directors commentary. It was released for Linux OS X PlayStation 4 PlayStation Vita and Windows in January 2015 for Android and iOS in May 2015 for Nintendo Switch in November 2018 and for Xbox One in October 2020. Gameplay Grim Fandango is an adventure game in which the player controls Manuel Manny Calavera calavera being Spanish for skull as he follows Mercedes Meche Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine prerendering static backgrounds from 3D models while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. Additionally cutscenes in the game have also been prerendered in 3D. The player controls Mannys movements and actions with a keyboard a joystick or a gamepad. The remastered edition allows control via a mouse as well. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects parts of the scenery or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head toward that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in and out of his coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games the player can never die or otherwise get into a nowin situation that prevents completion of the game. Synopsis Setting Grim Fandango takes place in the Land of the Dead the Eighth Underworld where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Land of Eternal Rest the Ninth Underworld on the Four Year Journey of the Soul. Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages provided by the Department of Death to assist in making the journey such as sports cars and luxury ocean cruises the best of which is the Number Nine an express train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. However souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs and stay in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living. The souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal calaca figures. Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of daytoday life such as vehicle maintenance and even drink service. The souls themselves can suffer deathwithindeath by being sprouted the result of being shot with sproutellafilled darts that cause flowers to grow out through bones rapidly feeding off the calcium of the souls skeleton. The ones who are sprouted are reincarnated. Many of the characters are Mexican and occasional Spanish words are interspersed into the English dialogue resulting in Spanglish. Many of the characters smoke following a film noir tradition the manual asks players to consider that every smoker in the game is dead. Plot The characters in Grim Fandango are based on Mexican calaca figures used to celebrate the Day of the Dead. The game is divided into four acts each taking place on November 2 the Day of the Dead in four consecutive years. Manuel Manny Calavera is a travel agent at the Department of Death in the city of El Marrow forced into his job to work off a debt to the powers that be. Manny is frustrated with being assigned clients that must take the fouryear journey due to their poor living choices and is threatened to be fired by his boss Don Copal if he does not come up with better clients. Manny steals a client Mercedes Meche Colomar from his successful coworker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the fouryear journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the Number Nine luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life. When Manny went to his boss while asking Meche to wait for him fixing the issue Meche starts her journey on foot herself. Don Copal uses it as a reason to arrest Manny. Manny was freed from arrest and sprouting by Salvador Sal Limones the leader of the small underground organization the Lost Souls Alliance LSA who warns him of Domino and Don rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld Hector LeMans. LeMans then sells the tickets at an exorbitant price to those that can afford it. Sal recruits Manny to help LSA by setting up a system of pigeon mail and providing the group with biometrics of Manny in order to access the computer systems of the Department. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there and waits for her to arrive. altA compute image of approximately 40 characters most skeletal figures with a few large cartoonish characters arranged on a series of steps posing for the photograph one figure is of a human face imposed onto the character. A year passes and the city of Rubacava has grown. Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny sees Meche leaving the port with Domino but when he tries to stop them he himself was stopped by Meche. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda the owner of the beatnik Blue Casket nightclub that Don has been sprouted for letting the scandal be known. Manny gives chase manages to get on a board of leaving ship as a janitor and a year later after being promoted to a captain tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny. All of Dominos clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hectors scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny along with Meche Glottis and a few of the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World. The three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. The Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld wont let the souls progress without their tickets mistakenly believing they have sold them and its further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or stolen Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train which sends all souls on board to hell. Meanwhile Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a rocket train cart quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis life. The three return to El Marrow now found to be fully in Hectors control and renamed as Nuevo Marrow. Manny regroups with Sal and his expanded LSA and with the help of Olivia who volunteered to join the gang earlier in Rubacava and is able to learn about Hectors current activities.

Development Background and project inception Tim Schafer was the project lead for Grim Fandango.altA middle aged Caucasian man with dark hair speaks from a lectern. Grim Fandango development was led by project leader Tim Schafer codesigner of Day of the Tentacle and creator of Full Throttle and the more recent Psychonauts and Brtal Legend. Schafer had conceived a Day of the Deadthemed adventure before production of Full Throttle began and he submitted both concepts to LucasArts for approval at the same time. Full Throttle was accepted instead because of its greater mainstream appeal it became a hit and opened the way for Schafer to create Grim Fandango. Rogue Leaders The Story of LucasArts noted that the pitching process for Grim Fandango was a breeze because of Schafers earlier success despite the new projects unusual theme. Development began soon after the completion of Full Throttle in June 1995. Grim Fandango was an attempt by LucasArts to rejuvenate the graphic adventure genre in decline by 1998. In response to complaints that Full Throttle was too short Schafer set the goal of having twice as many puzzles as Full Throttle which demanded a more lengthy and ambitious story to accommodate them. According to Schafer the game was developed on a 3 million budget. It was the first LucasArts adventure since Labyrinth not to use the SCUMM engine instead using the Sith engine pioneered by Jedi Knight Dark Forces II as the basis of the new GrimE engine. The GrimE engine was built using the scripting language Lua. This design decision was due to LucasArts programmer Bret Mogilefskys interest in the language and is considered one of the first uses of Lua in gaming applications. The games success led to the languages use in many other games and applications including Escape from Monkey Island and Baldurs Gate. 3D design Grim Fandango mixed static prerendered background images with 3D characters and objects. Part of this decision was based on how the calaca figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered Mannys character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing threedimensional models to prerender the backgrounds they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by rerendering the background instead of having to have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Mannys head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot using the same ingame style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game. Themes and influences The game combines several Aztec beliefs of the afterlife and underworld with 1930s Art Deco design motifs and a dark plot reminiscent of the film noir genre. The Aztec motifs of the game were influenced by Schafers decadelong fascination with folklore stemming from an anthropology class he took at University of California Berkeley and talks with folklorist Alan Dundes with Schafer recognizing that the fouryear journey of the soul in the afterlife would set the stage for an adventure game. Schafer stated that once he had set on the Afterlife setting Then I thought what role would a person want to play in a Day of the Dead scenario? Youd want to be the grim reaper himself. Thats how Manny got his job. Then I imagined him picking up people in the land of the living and bringing them to the land of the dead like hes really just a glorified limo or taxi driver. So the idea came of Manny having this really mundane job that looks glamorous because he has the robe and the scythe but really hes just punching the clock. Schafer recounted a Mexican folklore about how the dead were buried with two bags of gold to be used in the afterlife one on their chest and one hidden in their coffin such that if the spirits in the afterlife stole the one on the chest they would still have the hidden bag of gold this idea of a criminal element in the afterlife led to the idea of a crimeridden film noir style to the world. The division of the game into four years was a way of breaking the games overall puzzle into four discrete sections. Each year was divided into several nonlinear branches of puzzles that all had to be solved before the player could progress to the next year. altA flow diagram consisting of text boxes connected by arrows the contents of each box list out the summary of a puzzle that is to be completed before following puzzles can be completed. Schafer opted to give the conversationheavy game the flavor of film noir set in the 1930s and 1940s stating that theres something that I feel is really honest about the way people talked thats different than modern movies. He was partially inspired by novels written by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Several film noir movies were also inspiration for much of the games plot and characters. Tim Schafer stated that the true inspiration was drawn from films like Double Indemnity in which a weak and undistinguished insurance salesman finds himself entangled in a murder plot. The design and early plot are fashioned after films such as Chinatown and Glengarry Glen Ross. Several scenes in Grim Fandango are directly inspired by the genres films such as The Maltese Falcon The Third Man Key Largo and most notably Casablanca two characters in the games second act are directly modeled after the roles played by Peter Lorre and Claude Rains in the film. The main villain Hector LeMans was designed to resemble Sydney Greenstreets character of Signor Ferrari from Casablanca. His voice was also modeled after Greenstreet complete with his trademark chuckle. Visually the game drew inspiration from various sources the skeletal character designs were based largely on the calaca figures used in Mexican Day of the Dead festivities while the architecture ranged from Art Deco skyscrapers to an Aztec temple. The team turned to LucasArts artist Peter Chan to create the calaca figures. The art of Ed Big Daddy Roth was used as inspiration for the designs of the hot rods and the demon characters like Glottis. Originally Schafer had come up with the name Deeds of the Dead for the games title as he had originally planned Manny to be a real estate agent in the Land of the Dead. Other potential titles included The Long Siesta and Dirt Nap before he came up with the title Grim Fandango. Voice cast Tony Plana pictured in 2013 provides the voice for Manny. The game featured a large cast for voice acting in the games dialog and cutscenes employing many Latino actors to help with the Spanish slang. Voice actors included Tony Plana as Manny Maria CanalsBarrera as Meche Alan Blumenfeld as Glottis and Jim Ward as Hector. Schafer credits Plana for helping to deepen the character of Manny as the voice actor was a native Spanish speaker and suggested alternate dialog for the game that was more natural for casual Spanish conversations. Schafer planned from the beginning for the voice cast to consist entirely of Latino performers. Original release Originally the game was to be shipped in the first half of 1998 but was delayed as a result the game was shipped on October 28 1998 for release on October 30 the Friday before November 2 the actual date of the Day of the Dead celebration. Even with the delay the team had to drop several of the puzzles and characters from the game including a climactic fivestep puzzle against Hector LeMans at the conclusion of the game Schafer later noted that they would have needed one to two more years to implement their original designs. Remastered version Acquisition of rights and announcement A remastered version of Grim Fandango was released for Linux OS X PlayStation 4 PlayStation Vita and Windows platforms on January 27 2015. The PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions feature crossbuy and crosssave. It was later released for Android and iOS on May 5. The remastered version was released as a PlayStation Plus title for the month of January 2016. The remastered version was predicated on the transition of LucasArts from a developer and publisher into a licensor and publisher in 2013 shortly after its acquisition by Disney. Under new management LucasArts licensed several of its intellectual properties IP including Grim Fandango to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions. Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties such as the 2009 rerelease of The Secret of Monkey Island. Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from LucasArts in the years prior but the frequent change in management stalled progress. When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition they found that Sony through their vice president of publisher and developer relations Adam Boyes was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4 and was also inspired to seek Grim Fandango after seeing developers like Capcom and Midway Games revive older properties. Boyes determination was supported by John Vignocchi VP of Production for Disney Interactive who also shared memories of the game and was able to bring in contacts to track down the games assets. After discovering they were vying for the same property Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding planning to make the rerelease a remastered version. Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers. Challenges A comparison of Grim Fandango from its original release top and the remastered version. Double Fine increased texture resolution and improved lighting models to improve the looks of the characters. A major complication in remastering the original work was having many of the critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape DLT which DisneyLucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the games audio development data from the tapes. Schafer noted at the time of Grim Fandango original development retention of code was not as rigorous as presentday standards and in some cases Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the lowresolution artwork of the original game such as an emblem on one characters hat and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design. Once original assets were identified as to be used to present the classic look of the game in the Remastered edition Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers. The textures and lighting models for the characters were improved in particular for Manny. Schafer has likened the remastering approach to The Criterion Collection film releases in providing a highfidelity version of the game without changing the story or the characters. In addition to his own developers Schafer reached out to players who had created unofficial patches and graphical improvements on the original game and modifications needed to keep it running in ResidualVM and gained their help to improve the games assets for the remastered version. One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the games movement controls from the tank controls to a point and clickstyle interface. Schafer said the team used tank controls as it was popular with other games like Resident Evil at the time but recognized it did not work well within the adventure game genre. Schafer contacted Tobias Pfaff who created the pointandclick modification to obtain access to his code to incorporate into the remastered version. Later development and new features Double Fine demonstrated an inprogress version of the remastered game at IndieCade event in October 2014 new features included higherresolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having realtime lighting models and the ability to switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics at the touch of a control. The remastered game runs in 43 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 169 ratio rather than render in a native 43 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaffs patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank like controls including analogue controls for console versions and pointandclick controls for computer versions. The games soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fines Broken Age. The remastered version also includes developer commentary which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions. A Nintendo Switch port was released on November 1 2018. Double Fine was acquired by Xbox Game Studios in 2019 and Grim Fandango for the Xbox One arrived in 2020. Soundtrack Original soundtrack A sample of the Casino Calavera track as heard on the remastered soundtrack. In the first release of the game IGN noted that LucasArts has put together a film class soundtrack that uses a blend of simple jazz and classical Mexican themes to add depth to the atmosphere of an already fantastic title. Not only is the soundtrack not annoying but once again it is used to reinforce the emotions delivered in various sequences of the game. Grim Fandango has an original soundtrack that combines orchestral score South American folk music jazz bebop swing and big band music inspired by the likes of Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman as well as film composers Max Steiner and Adolph Deutsch. It also has various influences from traditional Russian Celtic Mexican Spanish and Indian strings culture. It was composed and produced by Peter McConnell at LucasArts. Others credited are Jeff Kliment Engineer Mixed By Mastered and Hans Christian Reumschssel Additional Music Production. The score featured live musicians that McConnell knew or made contact with in San Franciscos Mission District including a mariachi band. The soundtrack was released as a CD in 1998. The soundtrack was very well received. IGN called it a beautiful soundtrack that youll find yourself listening to even after youre done with the game. SEMO said the compositions and performances are so good that listening to this album on a standalone basis can make people feel like theyre in a bar back then. RPGFan said the pieces are beautifully composed wonderfully playednbsp... has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside the context of the game. This CD was an absolute pleasure to listen to and comes highly recommended. Game Revolution in its game review praised as one of the most memorable soundtracks ever to grace the inside of a cranial cavity where an eardrum used to be. PC Gamer in its 2014 list of Top 100 Games acclaimed Grim Fandango for including one of the best soundtracks in PC gaming history. In 2017 Fact magazine also listed it as one of the 100 best video game soundtracks of all time. In 1999s Academy of Interactive Arts Sciences Interactive Achievement Awards the soundtrack was nominated in the category of Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music. It was also lauded by GameSpot which awarded it the Best PC Music awards and included it in the Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks list in 1999. Remastered soundtrack After the original Pro Tools sound files were recovered Peter McConnell found that some of the samples he had used originally did not sound good and the team opted to reorchestrate the score. The games soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra for the remastered version of the game. The remade soundtrack was produced under Nile Rodgers label Sumthing Else. It had a standard release of 37 tracks as well as a Directors Cut with 14 extra tracks the latter sold exclusively through Sumthing Else. It included the original score from the LucasArts archives new compositions by Peter McConnell and new orchestral arrangements as well as new extended versions of jazz pieces remixed at Sony Computer Entertainment America. In 2018 celebrating the 20th anniversary of the original release of the game the soundtrack was released for the first time in vinyl format. Reception Reviews AdvGamers Allgame Edge 910 GameRev A GSpot 9.310 IGN 9.410 NGen PCGUS 91 PCZone 9.010 Grim Fandango gained critical acclaim upon its release. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the game a score of 94100. Critics lauded the art direction in particular with GameSpot rating the visual design as consistently great. PC Zone emphasized the production as a whole calling the direction costumes characters music and atmosphere expertly done. They also commented the game would make a superb film. The San Francisco Chronicle stated Grim Fandango feels like a wild dance through a cartoonish filmnoir adventure. Its wacky characters seductive puzzlefilled plot and a nearly invisible interface allow players to lose themselves in the game just as cinemagoers might get lost in a movie. The Houston Chronicle in naming Grim Fandango the best game of 1998 along with HalfLife complimented the graphics calling them jawdropping and commented that the game is full of both dark and light humor. IGN summed its review up by saying the game was the best adventure game it had ever seen. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game rating it five stars out of five and stated that Grim Fandango is a smart beautiful and enjoyable adventure game that will leave you holding your breath waiting for Grim Fandango 2. The game also received criticisms from the media. Several reviewers noted that there were difficulties experienced with the interface requiring a certain learning curve to get used to and selected camera angles for some puzzles were poorly chosen. The use of elevators in the game was particularly noted as troublesome. The review from Adventure Gamers expressed dislike of the soundtrack and at times found it too heavy and not well suited to the games theme. A Computer and Video Games review also noted that the game had continuous and long data loading from the CDROM that interrupted the game and spoils the fluidity of some sequences and causes niggling delays. In 1999 Next Generation listed Grim Fandango as number 26 on their Top 50 Games of All Time commenting that Grim offered adventure fans funny touching and infuriating moments in following its characters and it did so through a magnificently beautiful game. Awards Grim Fandango won several awards after its release in 1998. PC Gamer selected the game as the 1998 Adventure Game of the Year. The game won IGNs Best Adventure Game of the Year in 1998 while GameSpot awarded it their Best of E3 1998 PC Adventure Game of the Year PC Game of the Year Best PC Graphics for Artistic Design and Best PC Music awards. GameSpot named Grim Fandango its Game of the Year for 1998 and in the following year included the game in their Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks and was selected as the 10th Best PC Ending by their readership.

Grim Fandango has been included in several publishers Top Games lists well after its release. GameSpot inducted the game into their Greatest Games of All Time in 2003 citing Ask just about anyone who has played Grim Fandango and he or she will agree that its one of the greatest games of all time. GameSpy also added the game to their Hall of Fame in 2004 further describing it as the seventh Most Underrated Game of All Time in 2003. Adventure Gamers listed Grim Fandango as the seventh Top Adventure Game of All Time in 2004 in their 2011 list of Top 100 AllTime Adventures it was listed as 1. In 2007 IGN included the game in the Topnbsp25 PC Games as 15th and Topnbsp100 Games of All Time at 36th citing that LucasArts secondtolast stab at the classic adventure genre may very well be the most original and brilliant one ever made.

Lists of awards and rankings Sales and aftermath Initial estimates suggested that Grim Fandango sold well during the 1998 holiday season. It debuted at 6 for the first week of November on PC Datas computer game sales charts at an average retail price of 35. It was absent by its second week.

Grim Fandango sold another 16157 units in the region during 2001 and 8032 in the first six months of 2002 its jewel case SKU reached 5621 sales during 2003. According to Tim Schafer the game achieved sales of approximately 500000 units by 2012 around 50 fewer than Full Throttle had achieved. It is commonly considered a commercial failure even though LucasArts stated that Grim Fandango met domestic expectations and exceeded them worldwide. Although LucasArts a privately held company will not release sales figures a spokesperson expressed confidence in the history and future of LucasArts original titles. The response to the Monkey Island series has been phenomenal he said. And Grim Fandango met domestic expectations and exceeded them worldwide. The game had become profitable by 2000 although Dave Grossman has said It was pretty ambitious and expensive and I dont think it made very much money back. A writer for Edge summarized in 2009 While its reputation as a flop isnt entirely accurate Grim s sales were either an indication that people preferred motorbikes to Gitanessmoking corpses or a sign of the times adventure games were simply on their way out. While LucasArts proceeded to produce Escape from Monkey Island in 2000 they canceled development of sequels to Sam Max Hit the Road and Full Throttle stating that After careful evaluation of current market place realities and underlying economic considerations weve decided that this was not the appropriate time to launch a graphic adventure on the PC. Subsequently the studio dismissed many of the people involved with their adventure games some of whom went on to set up Telltale Games creating an episodic series of Sam Max games. These events along with other changes in the video game market towards actionbased games are seen as primary causes in the decline of the adventure game genre. Grim Fandango underperformance was seen as a sign that the genre was commercially dead to rival Sierra as well. LucasArts stated in 2006 that they do not plan on returning to adventure games until the next decade. Ultimately the studio stopped developing video games in 2013 after The Walt Disney Company acquisition of Lucasfilm and was dissolved shortly thereafter. Tim Schafer left LucasArts shortly after Grim Fandango release and created his own company Double Fine Productions in 2000 along with many of those involved in the development of Grim Fandango. The company has found similar critical success with their first title Psychonauts. Schafer stated that while there is strong interest from fans and that he would love to go back and spend time with the characters from any game he worked on a sequel to Grim Fandango or his other previous games is unlikely as I always want to make something new. With the help of developers such as Double Fine and Telltale Games adventure games saw a resurgence in the 2010s with financially successful titles such as Broken Age The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us.

They also found the developers commentary to be very insightful to the history of the game. Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an autosave system as well as the game not receiving a full highdefinition upgrade leaving the higherresolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds. Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles though a staple of the day when Grim Fandango was first released remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them and that a hint system as was added to the Monkey Island remake would have been very helpful. The games pacing also unchanged from the original version was also found harder to grasp in both the pacing within the games four acts and the time taken to move around and between rooms. In his review for Eurogamer Richard Cobbett warned players to be careful of rosetinted memories that while the remastered version is faithful to the original it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in video game development. Wired Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was an artifact of its time an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing. Legacy In 2005 The Guardian characterized the game as the last genuine classic to come from LucasArts the company that helped define adventure games Tim Schafers noirpastiche follows skullfaced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead. With a look that takes from both Mexican mythology and art deco Grim Fandango is as unique an artistic statement as mainstream gaming has managed to offer. While loved by devotees its limited sales prompted LucasArts to back away from original adventures to simply exploit franchises. Eurogamer Jeffrey Matulef in a 2012 retrospective look believed that Grim Fandango combination of film noir and the adventure game genre was the first of its kind and a natural fit due to the scriptheavy nature of both and would later help influence games with similar themes like the Ace Attorney series and L.A. Noire. Grim Fandango has been considered a representative title demonstrating video games as an art form the game was selected in 2012 as a candidate for public voting for inclusion within the Smithsonian Institutions The Art of Video Games exhibit while the Museum of Modern Art seeks to install the game as an exhibit as part of its permanent collection within the Department of Architecture and Design. The game was included in the Game Masters exhibition organized in 2012 by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image ACMI an event devoted to explore the faces and the history behind computer games. Tim Schafer was featured as the creative force behind Grim Fandango within the exhibition section called Game Changers crediting him along a few other visionary game designers for having pushed the boundaries of game design and storytelling introducing new genres creating our bestloved characters and revolutionising the way we understand and play games. Grim Fandango has been the centerpiece of a large fan community for the game that has continued to be active more than 10 years after the games release. Such fan communities include the Grim Fandango Network and the Department of Death both of which include fan art and fiction in addition to other original content. In an interview with Kotaku after the announcement of the remaster Schafer stated that he has long considered the idea of a Grim Fandango sequel to further expand on the setting of the game. He felt the story would be a difficult component as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward or otherwise build the story around a new character. One option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an openworld mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.\",\n          \"Holloway in 1974 Stanley Augustus Holloway 1 October 1890nbsp 30 January 1982 was an English actor comedian singer and monologist.

At first he was employed chiefly as a singer but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small invented by Holloway and Albert Ramsbottom created for him by Marriott Edgar were absorbed into popular British culture and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s he was in demand to star in variety pantomime and musical comedy including several revues. Following the outbreak of the Second World War Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the British Film Institute and Path News and took character parts in a series of films including Major Barbara The Way Ahead This Happy Breed and The Way to the Stars. In the decade after the war he appeared in the film Brief Encounter and made a series of films for Ealing Studios including Passport to Pimlico The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt. In 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady a role that he played on Broadway the West End and in the film version in 1964. The role brought him international fame and his performances earned him nominations for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In his later years Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US toured in revues appeared in stage plays in Britain Canada Australia and the US and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children including the actor Julian Holloway.

These monologues employed the Holloway style that has been called the understated lookonthebrightside world of the cockney working class. ...

Doolittle in the original Broadway production of My Fair Lady. The librettist Alan Jay Lerner remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role even before it was written. Lerners only concern was whether after so long away from the musical stage Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at Claridges Lerner recalled He put down his knife and fork threw back his head and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted.

It is particularly associated with two families the Beauforts who held the title from the creation of 1448 and the Seymours from the creation of 1547 in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of Lord Protector of the Kingdom of England using a power granted in the will of his nephew King Edward VI. The only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is Baron Seymour which is used as a courtesy title by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles yet the holders precedence is higher than his title suggests by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset the only more senior nonroyal duke is the Duke of Norfolk.

Beaufort creations Beaufort arms Royal arms of King Edward III with France modern within a bordure compony argent and azure John Beaufort 137113731410 was the eldest son from John of Gaunts marriage to Katherine Swynford. He was created Earl of Somerset on 10 February 1397 on 9 September 1397 following his marriage to Margaret Holland daughter of Thomas Holland 2nd Earl of Kent he was promoted to Marquess of Somerset and a few weeks later on 29 September 1397 he was created also Marquess of Dorset. However in 1399 when Henry IV came to the throne his two marquessates were revoked. The Commons petitioned the King for his restoration but Somerset himself objected stating the name of marquess is a strange name in this realm. He was succeeded as Earl of Somerset by his son Henry Beaufort 14011418 but his early death left the earldom to his brother John Beaufort 14041444. He was created Duke of Somerset and Earl of Kendal on 28 August 1443 and died less than a year later on 27 May 1444 perhaps by suicide. The Dukedom of Somerset and Earldom of Kendal became extinct. The Earldom of Somerset passed to his brother Edmund Beaufort Count of Mortain c.14061455. Edmund had been created Earl of Dorset on 18 August 1442 and Marquess of Dorset on 24 June 1443. He was created Duke of Somerset under a new creation on 31 March 1448. Despite this he is usually referred to as the 2nd Duke of Somerset. The second duke was killed at the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455 and his peerages passed to his son Henry Beaufort 14361464 who had been known as the Earl of Dorset since his fathers creation as Duke of Somerset. After the defeat at the battle of Towton on 29 March 1461 he fled to Scotland and was attainted on 4 November 1461. All his honours and estates were declared forfeit. His titles were restored to him on 10 March 1463 but he deserted the King and was captured and beheaded after the battle of Hexham on 15 May 1464. He was unmarried but his illegitimate son Charles Somerset became the 1st Earl of Worcester. Henrys titles were forfeited by act of Parliament but his brother Edmund Beaufort c.14391471 was styled Duke of Somerset by the Lancastrians.

He was beheaded by the Yorkists and buried in the abbey church. Upon his death the house of Beaufort became extinct in the legitimate line. Royal family creations In 1499 Henry VII nominated his infant son Edmund to the dukedom of Somerset at his baptism but the child just over a year old when he died was probably never formally created a peer. The illegitimate son of Henry VIII Henry FitzRoy 15191536 by Elizabeth Blount was created Earl of Nottingham and Duke of Richmond and Somerset on 18 June 1525. He died without heirs on 23 July 1536 so his titles became extinct. Earl of Somerset under James VI and I Robert Carr c. 15871645 born KerrKer son of Sir Thomas Ker of Ferniehirst became a favourite of King James VI and I. On 25 March 1611 he was created Viscount Rochester and subsequently a privy councillor. On the death of Lord Salisbury in 1612 he began to act as the kings secretary. On 3 November 1613 he was created Earl of Somerset. He died in July 1645 leaving a daughter Anne. His titles became extinct.

Henry had created him Viscount Beauchamp of Hache in 1536 at the time of the marriage and Earl of Hertford in 1537. On the death of Henry VIII on 28 January 1547 Seymour was named in the kings will as one of his sixteen executors who then formed a regency council to rule during the minority of his nineyearold son and successor King Edward VI. Seymour was elected head of the council which on 1 February 1547 appointed him as Lord Protector of the Realm and Governor of the Kings Person when he became the most powerful man in England a king in all but name and ruled by proclamation. httpswww.tudorsociety.comedwardseymourdukesomerset Sarah Bryson Edward Seymour Duke of Somerset www.tudorsociety.com On 17 February 1547 httpswww.tudorsociety.com17february1547edwardseymourbecomesdukeofsomerset httpwww.tudorsociety.com the Council created him Duke of Somerset which reflected his ancient title as feudal baron of Hatch in Somerset centred on the manor of Hatch Beauchamp inherited by his ancestor Roger Seymour d.c.1361 from his marriage to Cecily Beauchamp d.1393 the aunt and heiress of John IV de Beauchamp 3rd Baron Beauchamp 13301361.

Seymour Papers at Longleat House Wiltshire Patent to Edward Seymour Duke of Somerset to bear the coat of augmentation granted to Queen Jane Seymour 10 Aug. 1547. Box I.10.f.119httpsdiscovery.nationalarchives.gov.ukdetailsrc333fd473a074d97a76d444096a31f46 Edward Seymour married twice in about 1535 he divorced his first wife Catherine Fillol disowning her and her children and married Anne Stanhope who bore him nine children. The patent of the dukedom specified that it was to descend to his issue by his second wife Anne Stanhope thus excluding his eldest son by his first wife from the title except in case of the failure of male heirs from the junior line. In 1547 he bought Berry Pomeroy Castle in Devon from Sir Thomas Pomeroy although he probably never visited it and it became the seat of his eldest son from his first marriage Edward Seymour 152715351593 whose son was made a baronet of Berry Pomeroy. On the failure of the junior male line in 1750 Sir Edward Seymour 6th Baronet of Berry Pomeroy became the 8th Duke of Somerset as the patent allowed and his descendants seated at Maiden Bradley House in Wiltshire continue to bear the title today. Less than two years after losing his position as Lord Protector his titles were forfeited and he was beheaded on 22 January 1552. He was replaced in the minority government of Edward VI by John Dudley Duke of Northumberland whose pragmatic style contrasted with Seymours mixture of idealism and arrogance. In 1644 Charles I granted the earldom of Glamorgan to Edward Somerset 16131667. He was a descendant of Charles Somerset the illegitimate son of Henry Beaufort 3rd Duke of Somerset. In return for obtaining military help from Ireland he promised Edward the title of Duke of Somerset. Under the Commonwealth Edward was banished from England and his estates were seized. At the Restoration his estates were restored and he claimed the dukedom of Somerset as promised to him by Charles I. However this claim was rejected by the House of Lords and so was the title of Earl of Glamorgan. This enabled King Charles II to restore the ducal title to the fourth creation family the Seymours who descend from the countrys de facto regent the lord protector in 1547. dexter A unicorn argent armed unguled and crined or gorged with a ducal coronet per pale azure and or and chained of the last sinister A bull azure armed unguled ducally gorged and chained or Debretts Peerage 1968 p.1036 Edward Seymour 15381621 was son and heir of Edward Seymour 1st Duke of Somerset from his second marriage. He was created the Earl of Hertford in 1559 under Elizabeth I. His grandson William Seymour 15881660 secretly married Lady Arbella Stuart 15751615 on 22 June 1610. She was the niece of Lord Darnley a Stuart first cousin of James I and bar for Jamess children next in succession to Scottish and English thrones. Both William and Arabella were imprisoned but managed to escape. William fled to Paris but Arbella was recaptured. She was imprisoned in the Tower of London where she died in 1615. William returned to England shortly after her death and inherited his fathers titles in 1621. Charles I received his support and made him Marquess of Hertford in 1640 and on 13 September 1660 shortly before his death on 24 October the title of Duke of Somerset was restored to him as its legitimate heir following its nonexistence for 108 years. He outlived his three eldest sons and as the dukedom descends to heirs male of the holder of the 1547 grant it passed to William Seymour 16541671 who was the son of the third son mentioned lived 16261654. The 3rd duke died unmarried and the title passed to John Seymour bef. 16461675 the last surviving son of the 2nd Duke his uncle. On his death without issue on 29 April 1675 only the Marquessate of Hertford became extinct. His distant cousin Francis Seymour 3rd Baron Seymour of Trowbridge 16581678 became 5th Duke of Somerset. Francis was the eldest surviving son of Charles Seymour 16211665 whose father Sir Francis Seymour c. 15901664 a younger brother of the 2nd Duke of Somerset had been created Baron Seymour of Trowbridge in 1641. When the 5th Duke died unmarried in 1678 the title passed to his brother Charles Seymour 16621748 youngest son of the 2nd Baron Trowbridge. The 6th Duke known as the Proud Duke was a favourite of Queen Anne. He first married Lady Elizabeth Percy daughter of Joceline Percy 11th Earl of Northumberland 16441670. She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch 17111773 daughter of Daniel Finch 2nd Earl of Nottingham. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748 at Petworth House Sussex at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage Algernon Seymour 16841750. Later subsidiary titles Algernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749 the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir Hugh Smithson husband of Algernons daughter Elizabeth Seymour bef. 17301776 whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister Lady Catherine Seymour 16931731. Without male issue on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford the barony of Beauchamp and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct and the dukedom of Somerset together with the barony of Seymour devolved on his distant cousin. Later descent Sir Edward Seymour 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy 16941757 became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750. The 1st baronet was Sir Edward Seymour 15561613 son of Edward Seymour 152715351593 who was the 1st Dukes eldest son and of Catherine Seymour ne Filliol. He was a seventhgeneration descendant of the 1st Duke. The 4th Baronet had been speaker of the House of Commons during the reign of Charles II and he moved the family home from Berry Pomeroy Castle in Devon to Bradley House in Maiden Bradley. Report and Transactions of The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Literature and the Arts. Vol 133 2001 p 1112. Upon this Dukes death he was succeeded by his eldest son Edward Seymour 17171792. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother Webb Seymour 17181793 who became the 10th Duke. His son Edward Adolphus Seymour 17751855 was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his fathers death. He changed the family name to St. Maur but Seymour was still very often used. 12th Duke and sons the Earls St. Maur Edward Seymour The 11th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son Edward Adolphus Seymour 18041885 who was created Earl St. Maur of Berry Pomeroy in 1863. His eldest son who predeceased him Edward A. F. Seymour 18351869 was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted Earl St. Maur. Commonly known as Ferdy he was an adventurer who joined Garibaldis army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17yearold maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels returning to England with her in 1868 to live near Brighton. Ferdy and Rosina had two children a girl named Ruth 18671953 was born whilst the couple were in Tangier and a boy named Richard Harold St. Maur 18691927 was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl married Rosina Harold would have been the heir to his grandfathers dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands offering reward of 50 equal to about today for evidence to support the claim but was unsuccessful. 13th19th dukes The 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour 18101891.

It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use 3D computer graphics overlaid on prerendered static backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games the player must converse with characters and examine collect and use objects to solve puzzles. Grim Fandango is set in the Land of the Dead and the retrofuturistic version of the 1950s through which recently departed souls represented as calacalike figures travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel Manny Calavera as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes Meche Colomar a virtuous soul on her journey. The game combines elements of the Aztec afterlife with film noir style with influences including The Maltese Falcon On the Waterfront and Casablanca. Grim Fandango received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as one of the greatest video games of all time. However it was a commercial failure and contributed towards LucasArts decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre. In 2014 with help from Sony Schafers studio Double Fine Productions acquired the Grim Fandango license following Disneys acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. Double Fine produced a remastered version of the game featuring improved character graphics controls including point and click an orchestrated score and directors commentary. It was released for Linux OS X PlayStation 4 PlayStation Vita and Windows in January 2015 for Android and iOS in May 2015 for Nintendo Switch in November 2018 and for Xbox One in October 2020. Gameplay Grim Fandango is an adventure game in which the player controls Manuel Manny Calavera calavera being Spanish for skull as he follows Mercedes Meche Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine prerendering static backgrounds from 3D models while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. Additionally cutscenes in the game have also been prerendered in 3D. The player controls Mannys movements and actions with a keyboard a joystick or a gamepad. The remastered edition allows control via a mouse as well. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects parts of the scenery or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head toward that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in and out of his coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games the player can never die or otherwise get into a nowin situation that prevents completion of the game. Synopsis Setting Grim Fandango takes place in the Land of the Dead the Eighth Underworld where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Land of Eternal Rest the Ninth Underworld on the Four Year Journey of the Soul. Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages provided by the Department of Death to assist in making the journey such as sports cars and luxury ocean cruises the best of which is the Number Nine an express train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. However souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs and stay in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living. The souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal calaca figures. Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of daytoday life such as vehicle maintenance and even drink service. The souls themselves can suffer deathwithindeath by being sprouted the result of being shot with sproutellafilled darts that cause flowers to grow out through bones rapidly feeding off the calcium of the souls skeleton. The ones who are sprouted are reincarnated. Many of the characters are Mexican and occasional Spanish words are interspersed into the English dialogue resulting in Spanglish. Many of the characters smoke following a film noir tradition the manual asks players to consider that every smoker in the game is dead. Plot The characters in Grim Fandango are based on Mexican calaca figures used to celebrate the Day of the Dead. The game is divided into four acts each taking place on November 2 the Day of the Dead in four consecutive years. Manuel Manny Calavera is a travel agent at the Department of Death in the city of El Marrow forced into his job to work off a debt to the powers that be. Manny is frustrated with being assigned clients that must take the fouryear journey due to their poor living choices and is threatened to be fired by his boss Don Copal if he does not come up with better clients. Manny steals a client Mercedes Meche Colomar from his successful coworker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the fouryear journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the Number Nine luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life. When Manny went to his boss while asking Meche to wait for him fixing the issue Meche starts her journey on foot herself. Don Copal uses it as a reason to arrest Manny. Manny was freed from arrest and sprouting by Salvador Sal Limones the leader of the small underground organization the Lost Souls Alliance LSA who warns him of Domino and Don rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld Hector LeMans. LeMans then sells the tickets at an exorbitant price to those that can afford it. Sal recruits Manny to help LSA by setting up a system of pigeon mail and providing the group with biometrics of Manny in order to access the computer systems of the Department. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there and waits for her to arrive. altA compute image of approximately 40 characters most skeletal figures with a few large cartoonish characters arranged on a series of steps posing for the photograph one figure is of a human face imposed onto the character. A year passes and the city of Rubacava has grown. Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny sees Meche leaving the port with Domino but when he tries to stop them he himself was stopped by Meche. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda the owner of the beatnik Blue Casket nightclub that Don has been sprouted for letting the scandal be known. Manny gives chase manages to get on a board of leaving ship as a janitor and a year later after being promoted to a captain tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny. All of Dominos clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hectors scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny along with Meche Glottis and a few of the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World. The three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. The Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld wont let the souls progress without their tickets mistakenly believing they have sold them and its further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or stolen Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train which sends all souls on board to hell. Meanwhile Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a rocket train cart quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis life. The three return to El Marrow now found to be fully in Hectors control and renamed as Nuevo Marrow. Manny regroups with Sal and his expanded LSA and with the help of Olivia who volunteered to join the gang earlier in Rubacava and is able to learn about Hectors current activities. Further investigation reveals that Hector not only has been hoarding the Number Nine tickets but has created counterfeit versions that he has sold to others while keeping the real tickets for himself in a desperate attempt to balance out his sinful life and get out of the Land of the Dead.

Development Background and project inception Tim Schafer was the project lead for Grim Fandango.altA middle aged Caucasian man with dark hair speaks from a lectern. Grim Fandango development was led by project leader Tim Schafer codesigner of Day of the Tentacle and creator of Full Throttle and the more recent Psychonauts and Brtal Legend. Schafer had conceived a Day of the Deadthemed adventure before production of Full Throttle began and he submitted both concepts to LucasArts for approval at the same time. Full Throttle was accepted instead because of its greater mainstream appeal it became a hit and opened the way for Schafer to create Grim Fandango. Rogue Leaders The Story of LucasArts noted that the pitching process for Grim Fandango was a breeze because of Schafers earlier success despite the new projects unusual theme. Development began soon after the completion of Full Throttle in June 1995. Grim Fandango was an attempt by LucasArts to rejuvenate the graphic adventure genre in decline by 1998. In response to complaints that Full Throttle was too short Schafer set the goal of having twice as many puzzles as Full Throttle which demanded a more lengthy and ambitious story to accommodate them. According to Schafer the game was developed on a 3 million budget. It was the first LucasArts adventure since Labyrinth not to use the SCUMM engine instead using the Sith engine pioneered by Jedi Knight Dark Forces II as the basis of the new GrimE engine. The GrimE engine was built using the scripting language Lua. This design decision was due to LucasArts programmer Bret Mogilefskys interest in the language and is considered one of the first uses of Lua in gaming applications. The games success led to the languages use in many other games and applications including Escape from Monkey Island and Baldurs Gate. 3D design Grim Fandango mixed static prerendered background images with 3D characters and objects. Part of this decision was based on how the calaca figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered Mannys character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing threedimensional models to prerender the backgrounds they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by rerendering the background instead of having to have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Mannys head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot using the same ingame style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game. Themes and influences The game combines several Aztec beliefs of the afterlife and underworld with 1930s Art Deco design motifs and a dark plot reminiscent of the film noir genre. The Aztec motifs of the game were influenced by Schafers decadelong fascination with folklore stemming from an anthropology class he took at University of California Berkeley and talks with folklorist Alan Dundes with Schafer recognizing that the fouryear journey of the soul in the afterlife would set the stage for an adventure game. Schafer stated that once he had set on the Afterlife setting Then I thought what role would a person want to play in a Day of the Dead scenario? Youd want to be the grim reaper himself. Thats how Manny got his job. Then I imagined him picking up people in the land of the living and bringing them to the land of the dead like hes really just a glorified limo or taxi driver. So the idea came of Manny having this really mundane job that looks glamorous because he has the robe and the scythe but really hes just punching the clock. Schafer recounted a Mexican folklore about how the dead were buried with two bags of gold to be used in the afterlife one on their chest and one hidden in their coffin such that if the spirits in the afterlife stole the one on the chest they would still have the hidden bag of gold this idea of a criminal element in the afterlife led to the idea of a crimeridden film noir style to the world. The division of the game into four years was a way of breaking the games overall puzzle into four discrete sections. Each year was divided into several nonlinear branches of puzzles that all had to be solved before the player could progress to the next year. altA flow diagram consisting of text boxes connected by arrows the contents of each box list out the summary of a puzzle that is to be completed before following puzzles can be completed. Schafer opted to give the conversationheavy game the flavor of film noir set in the 1930s and 1940s stating that theres something that I feel is really honest about the way people talked thats different than modern movies. He was partially inspired by novels written by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Several film noir movies were also inspiration for much of the games plot and characters. Tim Schafer stated that the true inspiration was drawn from films like Double Indemnity in which a weak and undistinguished insurance salesman finds himself entangled in a murder plot. The design and early plot are fashioned after films such as Chinatown and Glengarry Glen Ross. Several scenes in Grim Fandango are directly inspired by the genres films such as The Maltese Falcon The Third Man Key Largo and most notably Casablanca two characters in the games second act are directly modeled after the roles played by Peter Lorre and Claude Rains in the film. The main villain Hector LeMans was designed to resemble Sydney Greenstreets character of Signor Ferrari from Casablanca. His voice was also modeled after Greenstreet complete with his trademark chuckle. Visually the game drew inspiration from various sources the skeletal character designs were based largely on the calaca figures used in Mexican Day of the Dead festivities while the architecture ranged from Art Deco skyscrapers to an Aztec temple. The team turned to LucasArts artist Peter Chan to create the calaca figures. The art of Ed Big Daddy Roth was used as inspiration for the designs of the hot rods and the demon characters like Glottis. Originally Schafer had come up with the name Deeds of the Dead for the games title as he had originally planned Manny to be a real estate agent in the Land of the Dead. Other potential titles included The Long Siesta and Dirt Nap before he came up with the title Grim Fandango. Voice cast Tony Plana pictured in 2013 provides the voice for Manny. The game featured a large cast for voice acting in the games dialog and cutscenes employing many Latino actors to help with the Spanish slang. Voice actors included Tony Plana as Manny Maria CanalsBarrera as Meche Alan Blumenfeld as Glottis and Jim Ward as Hector. Schafer credits Plana for helping to deepen the character of Manny as the voice actor was a native Spanish speaker and suggested alternate dialog for the game that was more natural for casual Spanish conversations. Schafer planned from the beginning for the voice cast to consist entirely of Latino performers. Original release Originally the game was to be shipped in the first half of 1998 but was delayed as a result the game was shipped on October 28 1998 for release on October 30 the Friday before November 2 the actual date of the Day of the Dead celebration. Even with the delay the team had to drop several of the puzzles and characters from the game including a climactic fivestep puzzle against Hector LeMans at the conclusion of the game Schafer later noted that they would have needed one to two more years to implement their original designs. Remastered version Acquisition of rights and announcement A remastered version of Grim Fandango was released for Linux OS X PlayStation 4 PlayStation Vita and Windows platforms on January 27 2015. The PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions feature crossbuy and crosssave. It was later released for Android and iOS on May 5. The remastered version was released as a PlayStation Plus title for the month of January 2016. The remastered version was predicated on the transition of LucasArts from a developer and publisher into a licensor and publisher in 2013 shortly after its acquisition by Disney. Under new management LucasArts licensed several of its intellectual properties IP including Grim Fandango to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions. Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties such as the 2009 rerelease of The Secret of Monkey Island. Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from LucasArts in the years prior but the frequent change in management stalled progress. When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition they found that Sony through their vice president of publisher and developer relations Adam Boyes was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4 and was also inspired to seek Grim Fandango after seeing developers like Capcom and Midway Games revive older properties. Boyes determination was supported by John Vignocchi VP of Production for Disney Interactive who also shared memories of the game and was able to bring in contacts to track down the games assets. After discovering they were vying for the same property Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding planning to make the rerelease a remastered version. Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers. Challenges A comparison of Grim Fandango from its original release top and the remastered version. Double Fine increased texture resolution and improved lighting models to improve the looks of the characters. A major complication in remastering the original work was having many of the critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on Digital Linear Tape DLT which DisneyLucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer Jory Prum had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the games audio development data from the tapes. Schafer noted at the time of Grim Fandango original development retention of code was not as rigorous as presentday standards and in some cases Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the lowresolution artwork of the original game such as an emblem on one characters hat and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design. Once original assets were identified as to be used to present the classic look of the game in the Remastered edition Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers. The textures and lighting models for the characters were improved in particular for Manny. Schafer has likened the remastering approach to The Criterion Collection film releases in providing a highfidelity version of the game without changing the story or the characters. In addition to his own developers Schafer reached out to players who had created unofficial patches and graphical improvements on the original game and modifications needed to keep it running in ResidualVM and gained their help to improve the games assets for the remastered version. One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the games movement controls from the tank controls to a point and clickstyle interface. Schafer said the team used tank controls as it was popular with other games like Resident Evil at the time but recognized it did not work well within the adventure game genre. Schafer contacted Tobias Pfaff who created the pointandclick modification to obtain access to his code to incorporate into the remastered version. Later development and new features Double Fine demonstrated an inprogress version of the remastered game at IndieCade event in October 2014 new features included higherresolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having realtime lighting models and the ability to switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics at the touch of a control. The remastered game runs in 43 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 169 ratio rather than render in a native 43 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaffs patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank like controls including analogue controls for console versions and pointandclick controls for computer versions. The games soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fines Broken Age. The remastered version also includes developer commentary which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions. A Nintendo Switch port was released on November 1 2018. Double Fine was acquired by Xbox Game Studios in 2019 and Grim Fandango for the Xbox One arrived in 2020. Soundtrack Original soundtrack A sample of the Casino Calavera track as heard on the remastered soundtrack. In the first release of the game IGN noted that LucasArts has put together a film class soundtrack that uses a blend of simple jazz and classical Mexican themes to add depth to the atmosphere of an already fantastic title. Not only is the soundtrack not annoying but once again it is used to reinforce the emotions delivered in various sequences of the game. Grim Fandango has an original soundtrack that combines orchestral score South American folk music jazz bebop swing and big band music inspired by the likes of Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman as well as film composers Max Steiner and Adolph Deutsch. It also has various influences from traditional Russian Celtic Mexican Spanish and Indian strings culture. It was composed and produced by Peter McConnell at LucasArts. Others credited are Jeff Kliment Engineer Mixed By Mastered and Hans Christian Reumschssel Additional Music Production. The score featured live musicians that McConnell knew or made contact with in San Franciscos Mission District including a mariachi band. The soundtrack was released as a CD in 1998. The soundtrack was very well received. IGN called it a beautiful soundtrack that youll find yourself listening to even after youre done with the game. SEMO said the compositions and performances are so good that listening to this album on a standalone basis can make people feel like theyre in a bar back then. RPGFan said the pieces are beautifully composed wonderfully playednbsp... has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside the context of the game. This CD was an absolute pleasure to listen to and comes highly recommended. Game Revolution in its game review praised as one of the most memorable soundtracks ever to grace the inside of a cranial cavity where an eardrum used to be. PC Gamer in its 2014 list of Top 100 Games acclaimed Grim Fandango for including one of the best soundtracks in PC gaming history. In 2017 Fact magazine also listed it as one of the 100 best video game soundtracks of all time. In 1999s Academy of Interactive Arts Sciences Interactive Achievement Awards the soundtrack was nominated in the category of Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music. It was also lauded by GameSpot which awarded it the Best PC Music awards and included it in the Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks list in 1999. Remastered soundtrack After the original Pro Tools sound files were recovered Peter McConnell found that some of the samples he had used originally did not sound good and the team opted to reorchestrate the score. The games soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra for the remastered version of the game. The remade soundtrack was produced under Nile Rodgers label Sumthing Else. It had a standard release of 37 tracks as well as a Directors Cut with 14 extra tracks the latter sold exclusively through Sumthing Else. It included the original score from the LucasArts archives new compositions by Peter McConnell and new orchestral arrangements as well as new extended versions of jazz pieces remixed at Sony Computer Entertainment America. In 2018 celebrating the 20th anniversary of the original release of the game the soundtrack was released for the first time in vinyl format. Reception Reviews AdvGamers Allgame Edge 910 GameRev A GSpot 9.310 IGN 9.410 NGen PCGUS 91 PCZone 9.010 Grim Fandango gained critical acclaim upon its release. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the game a score of 94100. Critics lauded the art direction in particular with GameSpot rating the visual design as consistently great. PC Zone emphasized the production as a whole calling the direction costumes characters music and atmosphere expertly done. They also commented the game would make a superb film. The San Francisco Chronicle stated Grim Fandango feels like a wild dance through a cartoonish filmnoir adventure. Its wacky characters seductive puzzlefilled plot and a nearly invisible interface allow players to lose themselves in the game just as cinemagoers might get lost in a movie. The Houston Chronicle in naming Grim Fandango the best game of 1998 along with HalfLife complimented the graphics calling them jawdropping and commented that the game is full of both dark and light humor. IGN summed its review up by saying the game was the best adventure game it had ever seen. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game rating it five stars out of five and stated that Grim Fandango is a smart beautiful and enjoyable adventure game that will leave you holding your breath waiting for Grim Fandango 2. The game also received criticisms from the media. Several reviewers noted that there were difficulties experienced with the interface requiring a certain learning curve to get used to and selected camera angles for some puzzles were poorly chosen. The use of elevators in the game was particularly noted as troublesome. The review from Adventure Gamers expressed dislike of the soundtrack and at times found it too heavy and not well suited to the games theme. A Computer and Video Games review also noted that the game had continuous and long data loading from the CDROM that interrupted the game and spoils the fluidity of some sequences and causes niggling delays. In 1999 Next Generation listed Grim Fandango as number 26 on their Top 50 Games of All Time commenting that Grim offered adventure fans funny touching and infuriating moments in following its characters and it did so through a magnificently beautiful game. Awards Grim Fandango won several awards after its release in 1998. PC Gamer selected the game as the 1998 Adventure Game of the Year. The game won IGNs Best Adventure Game of the Year in 1998 while GameSpot awarded it their Best of E3 1998 PC Adventure Game of the Year PC Game of the Year Best PC Graphics for Artistic Design and Best PC Music awards. GameSpot named Grim Fandango its Game of the Year for 1998 and in the following year included the game in their Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks and was selected as the 10th Best PC Ending by their readership.

Grim Fandango has been included in several publishers Top Games lists well after its release. GameSpot inducted the game into their Greatest Games of All Time in 2003 citing Ask just about anyone who has played Grim Fandango and he or she will agree that its one of the greatest games of all time. GameSpy also added the game to their Hall of Fame in 2004 further describing it as the seventh Most Underrated Game of All Time in 2003. Adventure Gamers listed Grim Fandango as the seventh Top Adventure Game of All Time in 2004 in their 2011 list of Top 100 AllTime Adventures it was listed as 1. In 2007 IGN included the game in the Topnbsp25 PC Games as 15th and Topnbsp100 Games of All Time at 36th citing that LucasArts secondtolast stab at the classic adventure genre may very well be the most original and brilliant one ever made.

Lists of awards and rankings Sales and aftermath Initial estimates suggested that Grim Fandango sold well during the 1998 holiday season. It debuted at 6 for the first week of November on PC Datas computer game sales charts at an average retail price of 35. It was absent by its second week.

Grim Fandango sold another 16157 units in the region during 2001 and 8032 in the first six months of 2002 its jewel case SKU reached 5621 sales during 2003. According to Tim Schafer the game achieved sales of approximately 500000 units by 2012 around 50 fewer than Full Throttle had achieved. It is commonly considered a commercial failure even though LucasArts stated that Grim Fandango met domestic expectations and exceeded them worldwide. Although LucasArts a privately held company will not release sales figures a spokesperson expressed confidence in the history and future of LucasArts original titles. The response to the Monkey Island series has been phenomenal he said. And Grim Fandango met domestic expectations and exceeded them worldwide. The game had become profitable by 2000 although Dave Grossman has said It was pretty ambitious and expensive and I dont think it made very much money back. A writer for Edge summarized in 2009 While its reputation as a flop isnt entirely accurate Grim s sales were either an indication that people preferred motorbikes to Gitanessmoking corpses or a sign of the times adventure games were simply on their way out. While LucasArts proceeded to produce Escape from Monkey Island in 2000 they canceled development of sequels to Sam Max Hit the Road and Full Throttle stating that After careful evaluation of current market place realities and underlying economic considerations weve decided that this was not the appropriate time to launch a graphic adventure on the PC. Subsequently the studio dismissed many of the people involved with their adventure games some of whom went on to set up Telltale Games creating an episodic series of Sam Max games. These events along with other changes in the video game market towards actionbased games are seen as primary causes in the decline of the adventure game genre. Grim Fandango underperformance was seen as a sign that the genre was commercially dead to rival Sierra as well. LucasArts stated in 2006 that they do not plan on returning to adventure games until the next decade. Ultimately the studio stopped developing video games in 2013 after The Walt Disney Company acquisition of Lucasfilm and was dissolved shortly thereafter. Tim Schafer left LucasArts shortly after Grim Fandango release and created his own company Double Fine Productions in 2000 along with many of those involved in the development of Grim Fandango. The company has found similar critical success with their first title Psychonauts. Schafer stated that while there is strong interest from fans and that he would love to go back and spend time with the characters from any game he worked on a sequel to Grim Fandango or his other previous games is unlikely as I always want to make something new. With the help of developers such as Double Fine and Telltale Games adventure games saw a resurgence in the 2010s with financially successful titles such as Broken Age The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us.

They also found the developers commentary to be very insightful to the history of the game. Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an autosave system as well as the game not receiving a full highdefinition upgrade leaving the higherresolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds. Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles though a staple of the day when Grim Fandango was first released remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them and that a hint system as was added to the Monkey Island remake would have been very helpful. The games pacing also unchanged from the original version was also found harder to grasp in both the pacing within the games four acts and the time taken to move around and between rooms. In his review for Eurogamer Richard Cobbett warned players to be careful of rosetinted memories that while the remastered version is faithful to the original it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in video game development. Wired Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was an artifact of its time an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing. Legacy In 2005 The Guardian characterized the game as the last genuine classic to come from LucasArts the company that helped define adventure games Tim Schafers noirpastiche follows skullfaced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead. With a look that takes from both Mexican mythology and art deco Grim Fandango is as unique an artistic statement as mainstream gaming has managed to offer. While loved by devotees its limited sales prompted LucasArts to back away from original adventures to simply exploit franchises. Eurogamer Jeffrey Matulef in a 2012 retrospective look believed that Grim Fandango combination of film noir and the adventure game genre was the first of its kind and a natural fit due to the scriptheavy nature of both and would later help influence games with similar themes like the Ace Attorney series and L.A. Noire. Grim Fandango has been considered a representative title demonstrating video games as an art form the game was selected in 2012 as a candidate for public voting for inclusion within the Smithsonian Institutions The Art of Video Games exhibit while the Museum of Modern Art seeks to install the game as an exhibit as part of its permanent collection within the Department of Architecture and Design. The game was included in the Game Masters exhibition organized in 2012 by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image ACMI an event devoted to explore the faces and the history behind computer games. Tim Schafer was featured as the creative force behind Grim Fandango within the exhibition section called Game Changers crediting him along a few other visionary game designers for having pushed the boundaries of game design and storytelling introducing new genres creating our bestloved characters and revolutionising the way we understand and play games. Grim Fandango has been the centerpiece of a large fan community for the game that has continued to be active more than 10 years after the games release. Such fan communities include the Grim Fandango Network and the Department of Death both of which include fan art and fiction in addition to other original content. In an interview with Kotaku after the announcement of the remaster Schafer stated that he has long considered the idea of a Grim Fandango sequel to further expand on the setting of the game. He felt the story would be a difficult component as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward or otherwise build the story around a new character. One option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an openworld mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.\",\n          \"Holloway in 1974 Stanley Augustus Holloway 1 October 1890nbsp 30 January 1982 was an English actor comedian singer and monologist. He was famous for his comic and character roles on stage and screen especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady.

In 1921 he joined a concert party The CoOptimists and his career began to flourish. At first he was employed chiefly as a singer but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small invented by Holloway and Albert Ramsbottom created for him by Marriott Edgar were absorbed into popular British culture and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s he was in demand to star in variety pantomime and musical comedy including several revues. Following the outbreak of the Second World War Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the British Film Institute and Path News and took character parts in a series of films including Major Barbara The Way Ahead This Happy Breed and The Way to the Stars. In the decade after the war he appeared in the film Brief Encounter and made a series of films for Ealing Studios including Passport to Pimlico The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt. In 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady a role that he played on Broadway the West End and in the film version in 1964. The role brought him international fame and his performances earned him nominations for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In his later years Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US toured in revues appeared in stage plays in Britain Canada Australia and the US and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children including the actor Julian Holloway.

Graham pp. 150246 In 1913 Holloway was recruited by the comedian Leslie Henson to feature as a support in Hensons more prestigious concert party called Nicely Thanks. In later life Holloway often spoke of his admiration for Henson citing him as a great influence on his career. The two became firm friends and often consulted each other before taking jobs. In his 1967 autobiography Holloway dedicated a whole chapter to Henson Holloway and Richards p. 289 whom he described as the greatest friend inspiration and mentor a performer could have had. Later in 1913 Holloway decided to train as an operatic baritone and so he went to Italy to take singing lessons from Ferdinando Guarino in Milan. However a yearning to start a career in light entertainment and a contract to reappear in Bert Graham and Will Bentleys concert party at the West Cliff Theatre caused him to return home after six months.

Holloway and Richards p. 83 Holloway developed the character naming him after a Cockney friend of Henson called Annie Small Holloway and Richards p. 85 the name Sam was chosen at random. Holloway adopted a northern accent for the character.

In its obituary of Holloway The Times wrote that Sam and Albert became part of English folklore during the 1930s and they remained so during the Second World War. These monologues employed the Holloway style that has been called the understated lookonthebrightside world of the cockney working class. ...

American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s. In 1956 Holloway created the role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the original Broadway production of My Fair Lady. The librettist Alan Jay Lerner remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role even before it was written. Lerners only concern was whether after so long away from the musical stage Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at Claridges Lerner recalled He put down his knife and fork threw back his head and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted.

Concert Party The Gramophone October 1961 p. 72\",\n          \"Duke of Somerset from the county of Somerset is a title that has been created five times in the peerage of England. It is particularly associated with two families the Beauforts who held the title from the creation of 1448 and the Seymours from the creation of 1547 in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of Lord Protector of the Kingdom of England using a power granted in the will of his nephew King Edward VI. The only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is Baron Seymour which is used as a courtesy title by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles yet the holders precedence is higher than his title suggests by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset the only more senior nonroyal duke is the Duke of Norfolk. Several other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset but have become extinct.

Beaufort creations Beaufort arms Royal arms of King Edward III with France modern within a bordure compony argent and azure John Beaufort 137113731410 was the eldest son from John of Gaunts marriage to Katherine Swynford. He was created Earl of Somerset on 10 February 1397 on 9 September 1397 following his marriage to Margaret Holland daughter of Thomas Holland 2nd Earl of Kent he was promoted to Marquess of Somerset and a few weeks later on 29 September 1397 he was created also Marquess of Dorset. However in 1399 when Henry IV came to the throne his two marquessates were revoked. The Commons petitioned the King for his restoration but Somerset himself objected stating the name of marquess is a strange name in this realm. He was succeeded as Earl of Somerset by his son Henry Beaufort 14011418 but his early death left the earldom to his brother John Beaufort 14041444. He was created Duke of Somerset and Earl of Kendal on 28 August 1443 and died less than a year later on 27 May 1444 perhaps by suicide. The Dukedom of Somerset and Earldom of Kendal became extinct. The Earldom of Somerset passed to his brother Edmund Beaufort Count of Mortain c.14061455. Edmund had been created Earl of Dorset on 18 August 1442 and Marquess of Dorset on 24 June 1443. He was created Duke of Somerset under a new creation on 31 March 1448. Despite this he is usually referred to as the 2nd Duke of Somerset. The second duke was killed at the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455 and his peerages passed to his son Henry Beaufort 14361464 who had been known as the Earl of Dorset since his fathers creation as Duke of Somerset. After the defeat at the battle of Towton on 29 March 1461 he fled to Scotland and was attainted on 4 November 1461. All his honours and estates were declared forfeit. His titles were restored to him on 10 March 1463 but he deserted the King and was captured and beheaded after the battle of Hexham on 15 May 1464. He was unmarried but his illegitimate son Charles Somerset became the 1st Earl of Worcester. Henrys titles were forfeited by act of Parliament but his brother Edmund Beaufort c.14391471 was styled Duke of Somerset by the Lancastrians.

He was beheaded by the Yorkists and buried in the abbey church. Upon his death the house of Beaufort became extinct in the legitimate line. Royal family creations In 1499 Henry VII nominated his infant son Edmund to the dukedom of Somerset at his baptism but the child just over a year old when he died was probably never formally created a peer. The illegitimate son of Henry VIII Henry FitzRoy 15191536 by Elizabeth Blount was created Earl of Nottingham and Duke of Richmond and Somerset on 18 June 1525. He died without heirs on 23 July 1536 so his titles became extinct. Earl of Somerset under James VI and I Robert Carr c. 15871645 born KerrKer son of Sir Thomas Ker of Ferniehirst became a favourite of King James VI and I. On 25 March 1611 he was created Viscount Rochester and subsequently a privy councillor. On the death of Lord Salisbury in 1612 he began to act as the kings secretary. On 3 November 1613 he was created Earl of Somerset. He died in July 1645 leaving a daughter Anne. His titles became extinct.

Henry had created him Viscount Beauchamp of Hache in 1536 at the time of the marriage and Earl of Hertford in 1537. On the death of Henry VIII on 28 January 1547 Seymour was named in the kings will as one of his sixteen executors who then formed a regency council to rule during the minority of his nineyearold son and successor King Edward VI. Seymour was elected head of the council which on 1 February 1547 appointed him as Lord Protector of the Realm and Governor of the Kings Person when he became the most powerful man in England a king in all but name and ruled by proclamation. httpswww.tudorsociety.comedwardseymourdukesomerset Sarah Bryson Edward Seymour Duke of Somerset www.tudorsociety.com On 17 February 1547 httpswww.tudorsociety.com17february1547edwardseymourbecomesdukeofsomerset httpwww.tudorsociety.com the Council created him Duke of Somerset which reflected his ancient title as feudal baron of Hatch in Somerset centred on the manor of Hatch Beauchamp inherited by his ancestor Roger Seymour d.c.1361 from his marriage to Cecily Beauchamp d.1393 the aunt and heiress of John IV de Beauchamp 3rd Baron Beauchamp 13301361.

Box I.10.f.119httpsdiscovery.nationalarchives.gov.ukdetailsrc333fd473a074d97a76d444096a31f46 Edward Seymour married twice in about 1535 he divorced his first wife Catherine Fillol disowning her and her children and married Anne Stanhope who bore him nine children. The patent of the dukedom specified that it was to descend to his issue by his second wife Anne Stanhope thus excluding his eldest son by his first wife from the title except in case of the failure of male heirs from the junior line. In 1547 he bought Berry Pomeroy Castle in Devon from Sir Thomas Pomeroy although he probably never visited it and it became the seat of his eldest son from his first marriage Edward Seymour 152715351593 whose son was made a baronet of Berry Pomeroy. On the failure of the junior male line in 1750 Sir Edward Seymour 6th Baronet of Berry Pomeroy became the 8th Duke of Somerset as the patent allowed and his descendants seated at Maiden Bradley House in Wiltshire continue to bear the title today. Less than two years after losing his position as Lord Protector his titles were forfeited and he was beheaded on 22 January 1552. He was replaced in the minority government of Edward VI by John Dudley Duke of Northumberland whose pragmatic style contrasted with Seymours mixture of idealism and arrogance. In 1644 Charles I granted the earldom of Glamorgan to Edward Somerset 16131667. He was a descendant of Charles Somerset the illegitimate son of Henry Beaufort 3rd Duke of Somerset. In return for obtaining military help from Ireland he promised Edward the title of Duke of Somerset. Under the Commonwealth Edward was banished from England and his estates were seized. At the Restoration his estates were restored and he claimed the dukedom of Somerset as promised to him by Charles I. However this claim was rejected by the House of Lords and so was the title of Earl of Glamorgan. This enabled King Charles II to restore the ducal title to the fourth creation family the Seymours who descend from the countrys de facto regent the lord protector in 1547. dexter A unicorn argent armed unguled and crined or gorged with a ducal coronet per pale azure and or and chained of the last sinister A bull azure armed unguled ducally gorged and chained or Debretts Peerage 1968 p.1036 Edward Seymour 15381621 was son and heir of Edward Seymour 1st Duke of Somerset from his second marriage. He was created the Earl of Hertford in 1559 under Elizabeth I. His grandson William Seymour 15881660 secretly married Lady Arbella Stuart 15751615 on 22 June 1610. She was the niece of Lord Darnley a Stuart first cousin of James I and bar for Jamess children next in succession to Scottish and English thrones. Both William and Arabella were imprisoned but managed to escape. William fled to Paris but Arbella was recaptured. She was imprisoned in the Tower of London where she died in 1615. William returned to England shortly after her death and inherited his fathers titles in 1621. Charles I received his support and made him Marquess of Hertford in 1640 and on 13 September 1660 shortly before his death on 24 October the title of Duke of Somerset was restored to him as its legitimate heir following its nonexistence for 108 years. He outlived his three eldest sons and as the dukedom descends to heirs male of the holder of the 1547 grant it passed to William Seymour 16541671 who was the son of the third son mentioned lived 16261654. The 3rd duke died unmarried and the title passed to John Seymour bef. 16461675 the last surviving son of the 2nd Duke his uncle. On his death without issue on 29 April 1675 only the Marquessate of Hertford became extinct. His distant cousin Francis Seymour 3rd Baron Seymour of Trowbridge 16581678 became 5th Duke of Somerset. Francis was the eldest surviving son of Charles Seymour 16211665 whose father Sir Francis Seymour c. 15901664 a younger brother of the 2nd Duke of Somerset had been created Baron Seymour of Trowbridge in 1641. When the 5th Duke died unmarried in 1678 the title passed to his brother Charles Seymour 16621748 youngest son of the 2nd Baron Trowbridge. The 6th Duke known as the Proud Duke was a favourite of Queen Anne. He first married Lady Elizabeth Percy daughter of Joceline Percy 11th Earl of Northumberland 16441670. She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch 17111773 daughter of Daniel Finch 2nd Earl of Nottingham. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748 at Petworth House Sussex at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage Algernon Seymour 16841750. Later subsidiary titles Algernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749 the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir Hugh Smithson husband of Algernons daughter Elizabeth Seymour bef. 17301776 whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister Lady Catherine Seymour 16931731. Without male issue on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford the barony of Beauchamp and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct and the dukedom of Somerset together with the barony of Seymour devolved on his distant cousin. Later descent Sir Edward Seymour 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy 16941757 became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750. The 1st baronet was Sir Edward Seymour 15561613 son of Edward Seymour 152715351593 who was the 1st Dukes eldest son and of Catherine Seymour ne Filliol. He was a seventhgeneration descendant of the 1st Duke. The 4th Baronet had been speaker of the House of Commons during the reign of Charles II and he moved the family home from Berry Pomeroy Castle in Devon to Bradley House in Maiden Bradley. Report and Transactions of The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Literature and the Arts. Vol 133 2001 p 1112. Upon this Dukes death he was succeeded by his eldest son Edward Seymour 17171792. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother Webb Seymour 17181793 who became the 10th Duke. His son Edward Adolphus Seymour 17751855 was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his fathers death. He changed the family name to St. Maur but Seymour was still very often used. 12th Duke and sons the Earls St. Maur Edward Seymour The 11th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son Edward Adolphus Seymour 18041885 who was created Earl St. Maur of Berry Pomeroy in 1863. His eldest son who predeceased him Edward A. F. Seymour 18351869 was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted Earl St. Maur. Commonly known as Ferdy he was an adventurer who joined Garibaldis army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17yearold maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels returning to England with her in 1868 to live near Brighton. Ferdy and Rosina had two children a girl named Ruth 18671953 was born whilst the couple were in Tangier and a boy named Richard Harold St. Maur 18691927 was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl married Rosina Harold would have been the heir to his grandfathers dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands offering reward of 50 equal to about today for evidence to support the claim but was unsuccessful. 13th19th dukes The 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour 18101891.
