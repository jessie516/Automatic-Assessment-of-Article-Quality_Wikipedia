He was possibly a historical king of the [[Sumer]]ian [[city-state]] of [[Uruk]], who was posthumously [[Apotheosis|deified]]. His rule probably would have taken place sometime in the beginning of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]], {{circa}} 2900 \\u2013 2350 BC, though he became a major figure in Sumerian legend during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] ({{circa|2112|2004 BC}}).\\n\\nTales of Gilgamesh's legendary exploits are narrated in five surviving [[Epic of Gilgamesh#Sumerian poems|Sumerian poems]]. The earliest of these is likely \\\"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\\\",<ref>{{Cite web|title= Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the nether world: translation | publisher = Oxford |url= https://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr1814.htm|access-date=2021-03-18|website=etcsl}}</ref> in which Gilgamesh comes to the aid of the goddess [[Inanna]] and drives away the creatures infesting her ''huluppu'' tree. She gives him two unknown objects, a ''mikku'' and a ''pikku'', which he loses. After [[Enkidu]]'s death, his [[Shade (mythology)|shade]] tells Gilgamesh about the bleak conditions in the [[Ancient Mesopotamian underworld|Underworld]]. The poem ''[[Gilgamesh and Aga]]'' describes Gilgamesh's revolt against his overlord [[Aga of Kish]]. Other Sumerian poems relate Gilgamesh's defeat of the giant [[Humbaba|Huwawa]] and the [[Bull of Heaven]], while a fifth, poorly preserved poem relates the account of his death and funeral.\\n\\nIn later [[Babylonia]]n times, these stories were woven into a connected narrative. The standard Akkadian ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' was composed by a scribe named [[S\\u00een-l\\u0113qi-unninni]], probably during the [[Kassites|Middle Babylonian Period]] ({{circa|1600|1155 BC}}), based on much older source material. In the epic, Gilgamesh is a [[demigod]] of superhuman strength who befriends the wild man [[Enkidu]]. Together, they embark on many journeys, most famously defeating [[Humbaba]] (Sumerian: Huwawa) and the [[Bull of Heaven]], who is sent to attack them by [[Inanna|Ishtar]] (Sumerian: Inanna) after Gilgamesh rejects her offer for him to become her consort. After Enkidu dies of a disease sent as punishment from the gods, Gilgamesh becomes afraid of his death and visits the sage [[Utnapishtim]], the survivor of the [[Gilgamesh flood myth|Great Flood]], hoping to find [[immortality]]. Gilgamesh repeatedly fails the trials set before him and returns home to Uruk, realizing that immortality is beyond his reach.\\n\\nMost scholars agree that the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' exerted substantial influence on the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', two epic poems written in [[ancient Greek]] during the 8th century BC. The story of Gilgamesh's birth is described in an anecdote in ''On the Nature of Animals'' by the Greek writer [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] (2nd century AD). Aelian relates that Gilgamesh's grandfather kept his mother under guard to prevent her from becoming pregnant, because an oracle had told him that his grandson would overthrow him. She became pregnant and the guards threw the child off a tower, but an eagle rescued him mid-fall and delivered him safely to an orchard, where the gardener raised him.\\n\\nThe ''Epic of Gilgamesh'' was rediscovered in the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] in 1849. After being translated in the early 1870s, it caused widespread controversy due to similarities between portions of it and the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Gilgamesh remained mostly obscure until the mid-20th century, but, since the late 20th century, he has become an increasingly prominent figure in modern culture.\\n\\n==Name==\\n[[File:Archibald Sayce's and Theophilus Pinches' interpretation of the new name of Gilgamesh, in 1890.png|thumb|''Exit Gi\\u0161\\u021bubar!''

It is generally concluded that the name itself translates as \\\"the (kinsman) is a hero\\\", though what type of \\\"kinsman\\\" was meant is a point of controversy.

The [[ZIP code]] is 70447.\\n\\n== History ==\\nMadisonville was founded by [[Jean Baptiste Baham]] in 1800, before the United States acquired this area,  as the town of \\\"Coquille\\\" or \\\"Cokie\\\" because of the abundance of shells in the area, at the site of the Native American village of \\\"Chiconcte\\\". The town was renamed in honor of US President [[James Madison]] around 1811.<ref>{{cite web\\n|author=Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism\\n|url=http://www.stoppingpoints.com/louisiana/St.-Tammany/Madisonville/\\n|title=Madisonville Historical Marker\\n}}</ref>\\n\\nMadisonville was a notable port, providing bricks and other products of the towns along the [[Tchefuncte River]] to [[New Orleans]], in the decades before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the [[Capture of New Orleans]] by the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union Army]], this area remained under nominal [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] control; and the cutoff of trade with New Orleans across enemy lines was devastating to the local economy, which did not recover for decades after the peace.\\n\\nThe opening of the [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] and associated highways gradually brought Madisonville into the sphere of [[New Orleans metropolitan area|Greater New Orleans]], in the second half of the 20th century.\\n\\nMuch of the town flooded with the [[Lake Pontchartrain]] storm surge of [[Hurricane Katrina]], on August 29, 2005. The police/fire station and the town hall were damaged by the flood waters. The town flooded again in 2012 during [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)|Hurricane Isaac]].  Town buildings were again repaired but the police station was moved to a historic building at the intersection of Covington, St. John and Cedar Streets.  The fire station later moved to a new building on Hwy. 22 just west of the town center.\\n\\n===Jahncke shipyard===\\nFrederick (Fritz) Jahncke emigrated to New Orleans from [[Hamburg]], Germany in 1870. After working as a mason, he started a business that built the first sidewalks in New Orleans. Jahncke expanded; using a rented steam-driven hydraulic suction dredge, his firm was the first to extract sand and shell from the Tchefuncte and other rivers to make concrete used in expanding New Orleans.\\n\\nJahncke purchased a half-interest in the Baham Shipyard, entering into shipbuilding. In 1905 he purchased the remaining interest, acquiring land for yards, as well as warehouses, docks, storage facilities and equipment. He died in 1911 and the company passed to [[Ernest Lee Jahncke|Ernest Lee]], Paul F. and Walter F. Jahncke. In 1917, the company started building five wooden ships for the US Navy for [[World War I]]. Two ships were completed \\u2013 the ''SS Bayou Teche'', which was launched in March 1918, and the ''SS Balabac'' on September 29, 1918. The war ended November 11, 1918, and three of the ships were not completed. The ''SS Abbeville'' was completed on January 19, 1919, and the ''SS Pontchartrain'' on April 6, 1919. The last ship was hauled across the river and burned. Part of the hull is still visible at low tide.<ref>[http://www.insidenorthside.com/the-jahncke-shipyard-building-a-place-in-history/ Jahncke shipyard] Retrieved January 6, 2017.</ref>\\n\\n==Geography==\\n[[File:Madisonville Louisiana waterfront west side north from LA 22 bridge.JPG|thumb|left|Madisonville's waterfront, viewed from the drawbridge on [[LA 22]], features outdoor dining along the Tchefuncte River estuary.]]\\n\\nThe town of Madisonville is located on the banks of the Tchefuncte River, near where the river enters [[Lake Pontchartrain]].

Jerry notices that Pookie is different, unpredictable: she even lies to a nun on the bus so she can sit closer to him.\\n\\nAs Jerry settles into college life, the aggressive Pookie arrives unannounced one Saturday morning. The two spend time together over the weekend, and soon see each other regularly. Jerry falls for Pookie, but their different personalities keep them apart. They agree to have sex, but Pookie later tells Jerry she might be pregnant. When the pregnancy scare is over, Jerry decides to spend [[spring break]] alone to catch up on studies. But Pookie pleads with him to stay until he relents.\\n\\nA week alone with the needy, somewhat unstable Pookie makes Jerry realize they need time apart. Later he discovers she has dropped out of school. In time, he finds her in the same boarding house she had rented the first time she visited him. He puts her on a bus for home and, for now, the young lovers part their ways.\\n\\n==Cast==\\n* [[Liza Minnelli]] as Mary Ann \\\"Pookie\\\" Adams\\n* [[Wendell Burton]] as Jerry Payne\\n* [[Tim McIntire]] as Charlie Schumacher\\n\\n==Production==\\nMuch of ''The Sterile Cuckoo'' was filmed at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]]. Some of it was filmed in [[Sylvan Beach, New York]], including the [[Sylvan Beach Union Chapel]].

The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] oversees foreign relations and diplomatic missions of the country.\\n\\nEthiopia is one of few early African countries admitted to the League of Nations, becoming a member on 28 September 1923, and was one of the founding members of the United Nations. During the Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia had maintained its full sovereignty over European colonial power and fought the First Italo-Ethiopian War in 1895\\u201396. However, the League did not protect in accord with the envisaged \\\"collective security\\\" of the country, resulted Italy's occupation of Ethiopia for 5 years (1936\\u20131941).\\n\\nFrom 1950s, Ethiopia participated to UN peacekeeping missions such as in Korean War and Congo Crisis. Virtually, Ethiopia maintains diplomatic relations to most countries, and is non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.\\n\\n==History==\\n===Antiquity===\\n====Land of Punt====\\n[[Land of Punt|Punt]] (2500 BCE \\u2013 980 BCE) was predominantly a trading centre dominated by [[Ancient Egypt]] to [[Horn of Africa]]. Trading commodities includes exports of Egypt; one of the most essential was [[incense]], which was mainly used for religious rituals for [[embalming]] corpse. Other were [[ivory]], [[spices]], [[Hide (skin)|hides]] and exotic animals that convey route to coast of Ethiopia, thus Ethiopia has been an integral part of Punt. Egyptian expedition to southeastern African region was generally commenced in the second millennium BC, after stabilizing relations with kingdoms of today's [[Sudan]], the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], [[Napata]] and [[Mero\\u00eb]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Henze |first=Paul B. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySgCTIplVQ8C&q=addis+ababa+history+zewditu |title=Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia |date=2000 |publisher=Hurst & Company |isbn=978-1-85065-522-0 |language=en}}</ref>\\n\\n====South Arabia====\\n\\n[[File:Bab el Mandeb NAS-AR description.png|thumb|[[NASA]] capture of Arabic description of strait [[Bab el Mandeb]]. It is known for passage for South Arabian migration.]]\\nSome theorists hypothesized Ancient South Arabian people migrated [[Recent African origin of modern humans|out of Africa]] to the strait [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] when its sea level decreased to current status. When their civilization came to appear from 4th millennium BC, onward [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], adaptation of Semitic language was from end of [[Mediterranean]], though they used Canaanite alphabet developed from Syria or Palestine during second millennium BC. Apparently, these languages similarity compared to Hebrew and Phoenician alphabets, even though lacked scholarly consensus. By 500 BC, it was widely spoken such as the [[Ge'ez language]].{{sfn|Henze|2000|p=19}}\\n\\nWriting system through [[inscription]] on stone often detailed historical rival kingdoms in the region, most notability the Saba, Qataban, Himyar, [[Hadhramaut]], [[Ma'in]] and others. In 1959, American archeologists collected numerous artifacts and body of inscriptions in the area, belonging to [[primary source]]s. The inscription not only detailed about South Arabia, but also the early [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopian history]] associated with Kingdom of Aksum and its rulers.{{sfn|Henze|2000|p=20}}\\n\\n====Kingdom of Aksum====\\n[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|thumb|Map of [[Eastern Hemisphere]] in the first century featuring trade route of Aksum with the rest powerful states]] \\nThe [[Kingdom of Aksum]] has been a great power in classic Africa; once it has been referenced by Persian prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] in the 3rd century and Greco-Roman trading guide ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' in first century. Axum maintained well-defined foreign relations with powerful realms in the era. According to Stuart Munro-Hay witness, the Aksumite had several account of ambassadors that had delegation with neighboring powers. Occasionally, Aksumite contact with foreign powers also attested by archaeological or scarce finds.<ref name=\\\":2\\\">{{Cite web |title=Foreign Relations \\u2013 Addis Herald |url=https://www.addisherald.com/3-6-foreign-relations/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220404175707/https://www.addisherald.com/3-6-foreign-relations/#:~:text=Aksum%20had%20diplomatic%20and%20commercial,the%20purpose%20of%20their%20missions. |archive-date=4 April 2022 |access-date=2022-04-04 |website=Addis Herald |language=en-US |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\n====Egypt====\\nAksumite relations with pre-Roman Egypt was ostensibly uncertain. However, it was considered that Aksumite contact were also existed during the fall of [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] with [[Cleopatra]] death in 30 BC. Few artifacts were uncovered from Egypt such as cippus of Horus given to Bruce, and illustrated by him, and a few amulet figurines of blue faience<ref name=\\\":2\\\" /> or cornaline<ref name=\\\":2\\\" /> found at various sites of Ethiopia. Other include the double-uraeus, perhaps brought from [[Mero\\u00eb]].<ref name=\\\":2\\\" />\\n\\nAnother discoveries are an inscription of [[Ptolemy III]] copied by Kosmas at [[Adulis]] and ankh'-sign engraved on one of the stelae. During King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]]'s reign, he expedited to the Nile after [[Mero\\u00eb]] was entirely sacked. After its successor [[Noba]] emerged, it behaved badly to consign Aksumite ambassadors punished with military expedition. An aggressive mistreatment was objected by tribes such as the [[Mangurto]], the [[Nara people|Barya]], and the [[Khasa kingdom|Khasa]] by asking support, either regarded Aksum would an aide of Noba or possibly a suzerain.

Byzantine scholar [[Procopius]] told the voyage of crossing Red Sea for five days and nights and that \\\"the harbor of the Homeritae from which they are accustomed to putting to sea is called Boulikas\\\", presumably somewhere near Mukha, and \\\" at the end of the sail across the sea they always put in at the harbor of the Adulitae\\\" at the reign of King Kaleb.<ref name=\\\":2\\\" />\\n\\nArabian titles were experienced in South Arabia during Kaleb's reign; after his viceroy deposed by Jewish Himyar king Yusuf Asar, Yemen was no longer requisite to Aksum. The event led Aksumite to decline its dominion. An inscription dated to 543 AD mentioned that the new king named Abraha dealing with the restoration of great dam at Marib, and mentioned embassies from various foreign countries such as Aksum, Rome, Persia and various Arab groups.

The methods of compactification are various, but each is a way of controlling points from \\\"going off to infinity\\\" by in some way adding \\\"points at infinity\\\" or preventing such an \\\"escape\\\".\\n\\n== An example ==\\n\\nConsider the [[real line]] with its ordinary topology. This space is not compact; in a sense, points can go off to infinity to the left or to the right. It is possible to turn the real line into a compact space by adding a single \\\"point at infinity\\\" which we will denote by \\u221e. The resulting compactification is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a circle in the plane (which, as a closed and bounded subset of the Euclidean plane, is compact). Every sequence that ran off to infinity in the real line will then converge to \\u221e in this compactification.  The direction in which a number approaches infinity on the number line (either in the - direction or + direction) is still preserved on the circle; for if a number approaches towards infinity from the - direction on the number line, then the corresponding point on the circle can approach \\u221e from the left for example. Then if a number approaches infinity from the + direction on the number line, then the corresponding point on the circle can approach \\u221e from the right.\\n\\nIntuitively, the process can be pictured as follows: first shrink the real line to the [[open interval]] {{nowrap|(\\u2212[[pi|{{pi}}]], {{pi}})}} on the ''x''-axis; then bend the ends of this interval upwards (in positive ''y''-direction) and move them towards each other, until you get a circle with one point (the topmost one) missing. This point is our new point \\u221e \\\"at infinity\\\"; adding it in completes the compact circle.\\n\\nA bit more formally: we represent a point on the [[unit circle]] by its [[angle]], in [[radian]]s, going from \\u2212{{pi}} to {{pi}} for simplicity.  Identify each such point ''\\u03b8'' on the circle with the corresponding point on the real line [[tangent|tan]](''\\u03b8''/2).  This function is undefined at the point {{pi}}, since tan({{pi}}/2) is undefined; we will identify this point with our point&nbsp;\\u221e.\\n\\nSince tangents and inverse tangents are both continuous, our identification function is a [[homeomorphism]] between the real line and the unit circle without \\u221e. What we have constructed is called the ''Alexandroff one-point compactification'' of the real line, discussed in more generality below. It is also possible to compactify the real line by adding ''two'' points, +\\u221e and \\u2212\\u221e; this results in the [[extended real line]].\\n\\n== Definition ==\\n\\nAn [[embedding]] of a topological space ''X'' as a [[dense set|dense]] subset of a compact space is called a '''compactification''' of ''X''. It is often useful to embed [[topological space]]s in [[compact space]]s, because of the special properties compact spaces have.\\n\\nEmbeddings into compact [[Hausdorff space]]s may be of particular interest. Since every compact Hausdorff space is a [[Tychonoff space]], and every subspace of a Tychonoff space is Tychonoff, we conclude that any space possessing a Hausdorff compactification must be a Tychonoff space.  In fact, the converse is also true; being a Tychonoff space is both necessary and sufficient for possessing a Hausdorff compactification.\\n\\nThe fact that large and interesting classes of non-compact spaces do in fact have compactifications of particular sorts makes compactification a common technique in topology.\\n\\n=== Alexandroff one-point compactification ===\\n{{main|One-point compactification}}\\nFor any noncompact topological space ''X'' the ('''Alexandroff''') '''one-point compactification''' \\u03b1''X'' of ''X'' is obtained by adding one extra point \\u221e (often called a ''point at infinity'') and defining the [[open set]]s of the new space to be the open sets of ''X'' together with the sets of the form ''G''&nbsp;\\u222a&nbsp;{{mset|\\u221e}}, where ''G'' is an open subset of ''X'' such that <math>X \\\\setminus G</math> is closed and compact.

A topological space has a Hausdorff compactification if and only if it is [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]]. In this case, there is a unique ([[up to]] [[homeomorphism]]) \\\"most general\\\" Hausdorff compactification, the [[Stone\\u2013\\u010cech compactification]] of ''X'', denoted by ''\\u03b2X''; formally, this exhibits the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of Compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps as a [[reflective subcategory]] of the category of Tychonoff spaces and continuous maps.\\n\\n\\\"Most general\\\" or formally \\\"reflective\\\" means that the space ''\\u03b2X'' is characterized by the [[universal property]] that any [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] from ''X'' to a compact Hausdorff space ''K'' can be extended to a continuous function from ''\\u03b2X'' to ''K'' in a unique way. More explicitly, ''\\u03b2X'' is a compact Hausdorff space containing ''X'' such that the [[subspace topology|induced topology]] on ''X'' by ''\\u03b2X'' is the same as the given topology on ''X'', and for any continuous map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' \\u2192 ''K''}}, where ''K'' is a compact Hausdorff space, there is a unique continuous map {{nowrap|''g'' : ''\\u03b2X'' \\u2192 ''K''}} for which ''g'' restricted to ''X'' is identically&nbsp;''f''.\\n\\nThe Stone\\u2013\\u010cech compactification can be constructed explicitly as follows: let ''C'' be the set of continuous functions from ''X'' to the closed interval {{nowrap|[0, 1]}}.  Then each point in ''X'' can be identified with an evaluation function on ''C''.  Thus ''X'' can be identified with a subset of {{nowrap|[0, 1]<sup>''C''</sup>}}, the space of ''all'' functions from ''C'' to {{nowrap|[0, 1]}}.  Since the latter is compact by [[Tychonoff's theorem]], the closure of ''X'' as a subset of that space will also be compact.  This is the Stone\\u2013\\u010cech compactification.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Eduard|last= \\u010cech|author-link=Eduard \\u010cech| title=On bicompact spaces|journal=  [[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume= 38  |year=1937  |pages= 823\\u2013844|doi=10.2307/1968839|issue=4|jstor=1968839|hdl= 10338.dmlcz/100420|hdl-access=free}}</ref>\\n<ref>{{citation|first=Marshall H.|last= Stone|author-link=Marshall H.

In fact, the hyperboloid is part of a [[quadric]] in real projective four-space. The method is similar to that used to provide a base manifold for [[group action (mathematics)|group action]] of the [[conformal group of spacetime]].<ref>15 parameter conformal group of spacetime described in {{Wikibooks-inline|Associative Composition Algebra/Homographies}}</ref>\\n\\n== Projective space ==\\n[[Real projective space]] '''RP'''<sup>''n''</sup> is a compactification of Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. For each possible \\\"direction\\\" in which points in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> can \\\"escape\\\", one new point at infinity is added (but each direction is identified with its opposite). The Alexandroff one-point compactification of '''R''' we constructed in the example above is in fact homeomorphic to '''RP'''<sup>1</sup>. Note however that the [[projective plane]] '''RP'''<sup>2</sup> is ''not'' the one-point compactification of the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup> since more than one point is added.\\n\\n[[Complex projective space]] '''CP'''<sup>''n''</sup> is also a compactification of  '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>; the Alexandroff one-point compactification of the plane '''C''' is (homeomorphic to) the complex projective line '''CP'''<sup>1</sup>, which in turn can be identified with a sphere, the [[Riemann sphere]].\\n\\nPassing to projective space is a common tool in [[algebraic geometry]] because the added points at infinity lead to simpler formulations of many theorems. For example, any two different lines in '''RP'''<sup>2</sup> intersect in precisely one point, a statement that is not true in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. More generally, [[B\\u00e9zout's theorem]], which is fundamental in [[intersection theory]], holds in projective space but not affine space. This distinct behavior of intersections in affine space and projective space is reflected in [[algebraic topology]] in the [[cohomology ring]]s \\u2013 the cohomology of affine space is trivial, while the cohomology of projective space is non-trivial and reflects the key features of intersection theory (dimension and degree of a subvariety, with intersection being [[Poincar\\u00e9 dual]] to the [[cup product]]).\\n\\nCompactification of [[moduli space]]s generally require allowing certain degeneracies \\u2013 for example, allowing certain singularities or reducible varieties. This is notably used in the Deligne\\u2013Mumford compactification of the [[Moduli of algebraic curves|moduli space of algebraic curves]].\\n\\n== Compactification and discrete subgroups of Lie groups ==\\n\\nIn the study of [[discrete space|discrete]] subgroups of [[Lie group]]s, the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of [[coset]]s is often a candidate for more subtle '''compactification''' to preserve structure at a richer level than just topological.\\n\\nFor example, [[modular curve]]s are compactified by the addition of single points for each [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]], making them [[Riemann surface]]s (and so, since they are compact, [[algebraic curve]]s). Here the cusps are there for a good reason: the curves parametrize a space of [[lattice (group)|lattices]], and those lattices can degenerate ('go off to infinity'), often in a number of ways (taking into account some auxiliary structure of ''level''). The cusps stand in for those different 'directions to infinity'.\\n\\nThat is all for lattices in the plane. In {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] the same questions can be posed, for example about <math>\\\\text{SO}(n) \\\\setminus \\\\text{SL}_n(\\\\textbf{R}) / \\\\text{SL}_n(\\\\textbf{Z}).</math> This is harder to compactify. There are a variety of compactifications, such as the [[Borel\\u2013Serre compactification]], the [[reductive Borel\\u2013Serre compactification]], and the [[Satake compactification]]s, that can be formed.\\n\\n== Other compactification theories ==\\n\\n* The theories of [[end (topology)|ends of a space]] and [[prime end]]s.\\n* Some 'boundary' theories such as the [[collaring of an open manifold]], [[Martin boundary]], [[Shilov boundary]] and [[Furstenberg boundary]].\\n* The [[Bohr compactification]] of a [[topological group]] arises from the consideration of [[almost periodic function]]s.\\n* The [[projective line over a ring]] for a [[topological ring]] may compactify it.\\n* The [[Baily\\u2013Borel compactification]] of a quotient of a [[Hermitian symmetric space]].\\n* The [[wonderful compactification]] of a quotient of algebraic groups.\\n* The compactifications that are simultaneously convex subsets in a locally convex space are called [[convex

Grand Junction has been nicknamed \\\"River City\\\". It is near the midpoint of a {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} arcing valley, known as the [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand Valley]]; since the late 19th century it has been a major [[fruit]]-growing region. The valley was long occupied by the [[Ute people]] and earlier indigenous cultures. It was not settled by European-American farmers until the 1880s. Since the late 20th century, several [[winery|wineries]] have been established in the area.\\n\\nThe [[Colorado National Monument]], a unique series of canyons and mesas, overlooks the city on the west.

Fruit orchards, particularly between Grand Junction and Palisade to the east, remain important to the region's reputation and economy to the present day.  Fruits most often grown are peaches, pears, apricots, plums, cherries, and, particularly since the 1980s, grapes for wine.  In this semi-arid environment, these orchards thrive from a combination of abundant sunshine and irrigation from a system of canals that divert water from the Colorado River.\\n\\nAttempts were made to establish sugar beet farming and beet sugar production. The Grand Valley Sugar Company established a campaign in 1893, sending three train carloads to the [[Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]]. Several tariffs and subsidies to domestic sugar were established in the 1890s, which led to uncertainty in the market. After the 1897 [[Dingley Act]], the company was revived in 1898 and rallied to build a sugar factory. They failed to fundraise to build the plant. At the same time, Charles N. Cox was able to organize an effort to establish a factory in 1898 as well. [[John F. Campion]] and others including [[James Joseph Brown]], [[Eben Smith]], Charles E. Mitchell, George Trimble, James R. McKinnie, and [[Charles Boettcher]] invested, creating the Colorado Sugar Manufacturing Company in 1899 and contracting [[E. H. Dyer]] to build a factory. The failed to succeed, so they sold the plant to local investors, who were able to make it a success. The Campion-Boettcher group then created the [[Great Western Sugar Company]].<ref name=\\\"silverwedge\\\">{{Cite web |title=Silver Wedge: The Sugar Beet Industry in Fort Collins |author=Eric Twitty |work=SWCA Environmental Consultants |date=August 2003 |access-date=August 9, 2020 |url=https://www.fcgov.com/parkplanning/files/silver-wedge_the-sugar-beet-industry-in-fort-collins_a-historical-context.pdf}}</ref>\\n\\nRetail sales have been important to the economy for decades (e.g., gasoline, and hunting- and fishing-related sales), and uranium mining-related activities have also been significant.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090123111955/http://www.museumofwesternco.com/learn/grand-valley-history/history-timeline/ History Timeline]. Museum of Western Colorado</ref> Grand Junction was home to the [[Climax Uranium Mill]], a now decommissioned mill that provided uranium ore to the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]].\\n\\nEducation and healthcare have been important to the economy of the area, especially since the 1950s, with the rise of [[Colorado Mesa University]] and St. Mary's Hospital as leading employers in these fields.\\n\\nVast [[oil shale]] reserves were known to exist near [[Parachute, Colorado]] in the [[Piceance Basin]]. The oil embargoes of the 1970s and high gas prices resulted in major financial interest in the region. Exxon purchased rights and used Grand Junction as its seat of operations. The city and the surrounding [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand Valley]] became prosperous in the 1970s and early 1980s largely because of the effects of [[oil shale]] development. The United States, western Colorado in particular, has the largest-known concentration of oil shale in the world (according to the Bureau of Land Management) and holds an estimated 800 gigabarrels of recoverable oil, enough to meet U.S. demand for oil at current levels for 110 years. Known as the \\\"Rock That Burns\\\", the shale can be mined and processed to produce oil. In the past it was significantly more expensive than conventional oil. Sustained prices above $95 per barrel, however, may make extraction economically attractive in the coming years (see [[Oil shale economics]]). ExxonMobil pulled out of the region because of lower oil prices, which led to economic hardship in the region.\\n\\nThe economic bust, known as \\\"Black Sunday\\\" (May 2, 1982) to the locals, started with a phone call from the president of Exxon to Governor [[Richard Douglas Lamm]], stating that Exxon would cut its losses while retaining mining rights to the (then and currently) uneconomic oil. The economic bust was felt statewide, as Exxon had invested more than {{US$}}5 billion in the state. Colorado historian [[Thomas Noel (historian)|Tom Noel]] observed, \\\"I think that was a definite turning point, and it was a reminder that we were a boom-and-bust state ... There were parallels to the silver crash of 1893.\\\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1005mile.shtml |title=Oil shale collapse preserved scenic vistas |author=Richard Williamson |work=Denver Rocky Mountain News |date=October 5, 1999 |access-date=June 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627030617/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1005mile.shtml |archive-date=June 27, 2009}}</ref>\\n\\nBy 2008, the economy of Grand Junction appeared to be more diverse and stable than it had been in previous decades. Major contributors to the economy were health care, tourism, agriculture, livestock, and energy mining (gas and oil). Major energy companies had once again invested large amounts of money due to increases in oil and natural gas prices (such as in the years 2005\\u20132008). However, a major drop (in the summer of 2008) of market [[natural gas]] prices led to reduced gas well drilling and related capital expenditures in the area, significantly slowing the Grand Junction economy in 2009.

The race switched from Syracuse to [[Lexington, Kentucky]] for the 1927 and 1929 races, however, because of rainouts. Starting in 1930, [[Good Time Park]] in [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen, New York]] hosted the race until 1956 with the exception of 1943.

He served as [[List of mayors of Grand Rapids, Michigan|Mayor]] of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], [[United States Ambassador to Germany|Ambassador to Germany]] and [[United States Assistant Secretary of State]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\nUhl was born in the township of [[Rush, New York]], the son of David M. and Catherine (De Garmo) Uhl. The family moved to a farm near [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], in 1844. Uhl graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1862 and received an M.A. degree from the same institution in 1863. He then studied [[law]], gaining admission to the Michigan [[bar association|bar]] in January 1864, and began practice. He would practice law alone and in partnerships for the next thirty years.\\n\\nOn May 1, 1865, Uhl married Alice Follett, the daughter of Benjamin Follett, a prominent citizen and onetime mayor of Ypsilanti. They had four children: Lucy Follett, David Edwin, Alice Edwina and Marshall Mortimer.\\n\\nIn 1870 Uhl was elected Prosecuting Attorney of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]] and served in that office for two years. In 1876 the Uhl family moved to [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. In 1881 he became president of the Grand Rapids National Bank; he remained in that position until 1893, then returned to it in 1897. At one time he served as President of the Bar Association of Grand Rapids. In 1890 he was elected Mayor of Grand Rapids, serving two years.\\n\\nIn 1893 Uhl was appointed [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]] and moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] From May 28 to June 9, 1895, he served as Acting Secretary of State by appointment of [[Grover Cleveland|President Cleveland]]. In 1895 the federal government appointed him to inspect US [[consular office]]s throughout [[Europe]] and in 1896 he was appointed Ambassador to Germany, a post he held until 1897, when the Cleveland administration and its appointees were replaced. He returned to Grand Rapids and resumed his career there until his death four years later.\\n\\nHe is buried in [[Highland Cemetery]] in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]].\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://boards.ancestry.com/mbexec?htx=message&r=rw&p=localities.northam.usa.states.michigan.counties.kent&m=2451 Biography of Edwin F.

The school was opened by [[George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]] on 24 May 1954 and educates pupils from the age of 11 (\\\"Year 7\\\") to 16 (\\\"Year 11\\\").\\n\\n==Admissions==\\nThe Matthew Arnold School is on the outskirts of the east of Staines-upon-Thames, south of the [[A308 road|A308]], towards [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]]. It has transport links via buses [[London Buses route 117|117]] and 290, and via [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|trains]] at [[Staines railway station]]. Matthew Arnold takes in many pupils from a variety of schools located around Staines-upon-Thames and surrounding areas, including Buckland Primary School, Laleham Church of England School, Riverbridge Primary School, Town Farm Primary School, Our Lady of Rosary, Stanwell Fields, Clarendon, Ashford Park, Echelford Primary School and many more.\\n\\n==History ==\\n{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2023}}\\nAerial photographs taken on two occasions in 1933 illustrate the progress of construction of new housing in the immediate vicinity of the survey area. Photographs also show the [[Cropmark|cropmarks]] of a supposed Roman enclosure in the playing fields of the school. Subsequent aerial photographs, taken at regular intervals from the late 1940s to present also record cropmarks of the enclosure. The site was partially excavated in 1989-1990 and although the dating is inconclusive, it is suggested that the enclosures are of medieval date.<ref>{{cite report |author=Helen Winton |date=November 2007 |title=Caesar\\u2019s Camp, Matthew Arnold School, Staines, Surrey, Aerial Photograph Interpretation and Mapping |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/research/results/reports/6563/Caesar%E2%80%99sCampMatthewArnoldSchoolStainesSurrey_AerialPhotographInterpretationandMapping |publisher=English Heritage |docket=Research Department Report Series 52-2009 |issn=1749-8775}}</ref>\\n\\nThe Matthew Arnold School began before the [[World War II|Second World War]] as a hospital, and some pupils were admitted before hostilities started (the boys section). The School was completed after the war as two [[Secondary modern school|Secondary Modern Schools]]. There was no state [[Grammar School]] in Staines-upon-Thames. Boys and Girls who passed the 11+ went to [[Spelthorne College|Ashford County School]] (Mixed) or [[Hampton Grammar School]] (boys only). With comprehensivisation in the 1970s Matthew Arnold became a mixed comprehensive school.  The school became an academy in 2012.\\n\\nConstruction was completed in January 2021 whereupon the old building was demolished and replaced by new facilities built by [[Wates Group|Wates Construction company]] with funding by the government\\u2019s Priority School Building Programme 2 (PSBP2), which aims to rebuild or replace the schools in the worst condition across the UK.<ref>{{Cite
