However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search. There are specialized [[data structures]] designed for fast searching, such as [[hash tables]], that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.\\n\\nThere are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, [[fractional cascading]] speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in [[computational geometry]] and in numerous other fields. [[Exponential search]] extends binary search to unbounded lists. The [[binary search tree]] and [[B-tree]] data structures are based on binary search.\\n\\n== Algorithm ==\\nBinary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Algorithm B\\\"}}\\n\\n=== Procedure ===\\nGiven an array <math>A</math> of <math>n</math> elements with values or [[Record (computer science)|records]] <math>A_0,A_1,A_2,\\\\ldots,A_{n-1}</math>sorted such that <math>A_0 \\\\leq A_1 \\\\leq A_2 \\\\leq \\\\cdots \\\\leq A_{n-1}</math>, and target value <math>T</math>, the following [[subroutine]] uses binary search to find the index of <math>T</math> in <math>A</math>.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Algorithm B\\\"}}\\n# Set <math>L</math> to <math> 0</math> and <math>R</math> to <math>n-1</math>.\\n# If <math>L>R</math>, the search terminates as unsuccessful.\\n# Set <math>m</math> (the position of the middle element) to the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] of <math>\\\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to <math>\\\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>.\\n# If <math>A_m < T</math>, set <math>L</math> to <math>m+1</math> and go to step 2.\\n# If <math>A_m > T</math>, set <math>R</math> to <math>m-1</math> and go to step 2.\\n# Now <math>A_m = T</math>, the search is done; return <math>m</math>.\\n\\nThis iterative procedure keeps track of the search boundaries with the two variables <math>L</math> and <math>R</math>. The procedure may be expressed in [[pseudocode]] as follows, where the variable names and types remain the same as above, <code>floor</code> is the [[floor function]], and <code>unsuccessful</code> refers to a specific value that conveys the failure of the search.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Algorithm B\\\"}}\\n[[File:Binary-search-work.gif|thumb|right|binary-search]]\\n '''function''' binary_search(A, n, T) '''is'''\\n     L := 0\\n     R := n &minus; 1\\n     '''while''' L \\u2264 R '''do'''\\n         m := floor((L + R) / 2)\\n         '''if''' A[m] < T '''then'''\\n             L := m + 1\\n         '''else if''' A[m] > T '''then'''\\n             R := m &minus; 1\\n         '''else''':\\n             '''return''' m\\n     '''return''' unsuccessful\\n\\nAlternatively, the algorithm may take the [[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]] of <math>\\\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>.

Some implementations leave out this check during each iteration. The algorithm would perform this check only when one element is left (when <math>L=R</math>).

For example, if the array to be searched was <math>[1,2,3,4,4,5,6,7]</math> and the target was <math>4</math>, then it would be correct for the algorithm to either return the 4th (index 3) or 5th (index 4) element. The regular procedure would return the 4th element (index 3) in this case. It does not always return the first duplicate (consider <math>[1,2,4,4,4,5,6,7]</math> which still returns the 4th element). However, it is sometimes necessary to find the leftmost element or the rightmost element for a target value that is duplicated in the array. In the above example, the 4th element is the leftmost element of the value 4, while the 5th element is the rightmost element of the value 4. The alternative procedure above will always return the index of the rightmost element if such an element exists.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"History and bibliography\\\"}}\\n\\n==== Procedure for finding the leftmost element ====\\nTo find the leftmost element, the following procedure can be used:{{Sfn|Kasahara|Morishita|2006|pp=8\\u20139}}\\n\\n# Set <math>L</math> to <math> 0</math> and <math>R</math> to <math>n</math>.\\n# While <math>L < R</math>,\\n## Set <math>m</math> (the position of the middle element) to the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] of <math>\\\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to <math>\\\\frac{L+R}{2}</math>.\\n## If <math>A_m < T</math>, set <math>L</math> to <math>m+1</math>.\\n## Else, <math>A_m \\\\geq T</math>; set ''<math>R</math>'' to <math>m</math>.\\n# Return <math>L</math>.\\n\\nIf <math>L < n</math> and <math>A_L = T</math>, then <math>A_L</math> is the leftmost element that equals <math>T</math>.

The comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as every level above the lowest level of the tree is filled completely.{{Efn|Any search algorithm based solely on comparisons can be represented using a binary comparison tree. An ''internal path'' is any path from the root to an existing node. Let <math>I</math> be the ''internal path length'', the sum of the lengths of all internal paths. If each element is equally likely to be searched, the average case is <math>1 + \\\\frac{I}{n}</math> or simply one plus the average of all the internal path lengths of the tree. This is because internal paths represent the elements that the search algorithm compares to the target. The lengths of these internal paths represent the number of iterations ''after'' the root node. Adding the average of these lengths to the one iteration at the root yields the average case. Therefore, to minimize the average number of comparisons, the internal path length <math>I</math> must be minimized. It turns out that the tree for binary search minimizes the internal path length. {{Harvnb|Knuth|1998}} proved that the ''external path'' length (the path length over all nodes where both children are present for each already-existing node) is minimized when the external nodes (the nodes with no children) lie within two consecutive levels of the tree. This also applies to internal paths as internal path length <math>I</math> is linearly related to external path length <math>E</math>. For any tree of <math>n</math> nodes, <math>I = E - 2n</math>. When each subtree has a similar number of nodes, or equivalently the array is divided into halves in each iteration, the external nodes as well as their interior parent nodes lie within two levels.

This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over ''all'' elements is worse than binary search. By dividing the array in half, binary search ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Further analysis of binary search\\\"}}\\n\\n=== Space complexity ===\\nBinary search requires three pointers to elements, which may be array indices or pointers to memory locations, regardless of the size of the array. Therefore, the space complexity of binary search is <math>O(1)</math> in the [[word RAM]] model of computation.\\n\\n=== Derivation of average case ===\\nThe average number of iterations performed by binary search depends on the probability of each element being searched. The average case is different for successful searches and unsuccessful searches. It will be assumed that each element is equally likely to be searched for successful searches. For unsuccessful searches, it will be assumed that the [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]] between and outside elements are equally likely to be searched. The average case for successful searches is the number of iterations required to search every element exactly once, divided by <math>n</math>, the number of elements. The average case for unsuccessful searches is the number of iterations required to search an element within every interval exactly once, divided by the <math>n + 1</math> intervals.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Further analysis of binary search\\\"}}\\n\\n==== Successful searches ====\\n<!-- E stands for \\\"expected\\\" -->\\nIn the binary tree representation, a successful search can be represented by a path from the root to the target node, called an ''internal path''. The length of a path is the number of edges (connections between nodes) that the path passes through. The number of iterations performed by a search, given that the corresponding path has length <math>l</math>, is <math>l + 1</math> counting the initial iteration. The ''internal path length'' is the sum of the lengths of all unique internal paths. Since there is only one path from the root to any single node, each internal path represents a search for a specific element. If there are <math>n</math> elements, which is a positive integer, and the internal path length is <math>I(n)</math>, then the average number of iterations for a successful search <math>T(n) = 1 + \\\\frac{I(n)}{n}</math>, with the one iteration added to count the initial iteration.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Further analysis of binary search\\\"}}\\n\\nSince binary search is the optimal algorithm for searching with comparisons, this problem is reduced to calculating the minimum internal path length of all binary trees with <math>n</math> nodes, which is equal to:{{Sfn|Knuth|1997|loc=\\u00a72.3.4.5 (\\\"Path length\\\")}}\\n\\n<math>\\nI(n) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\log_2(k) \\\\right \\\\rfloor\\n</math>\\n\\nFor example, in a 7-element array, the root requires one iteration, the two elements below the root require two iterations, and the four elements below require three iterations.

If an internal node, or a node present in the tree, has fewer than two child nodes, then additional child nodes, called external nodes, are added so that each internal node has two children. By doing so, an unsuccessful search can be represented as a path to an external node, whose parent is the single element that remains during the last iteration. An ''external path'' is a path from the root to an external node. The ''external path length'' is the sum of the lengths of all unique external paths. If there are <math>n</math> elements, which is a positive integer, and the external path length is <math>E(n)</math>, then the average number of iterations for an unsuccessful search <math>T'(n)=\\\\frac{E(n)}{n+1}</math>, with the one iteration added to count the initial iteration. The external path length is divided by <math>n+1</math> instead of <math>n</math> because there are <math>n+1</math> external paths, representing the intervals between and outside the elements of the array.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Further analysis of binary search\\\"}}\\n\\nThis problem can similarly be reduced to determining the minimum external path length of all binary trees with <math>n</math> nodes.

Assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, each iteration makes 1.5 comparisons on average. A variation of the algorithm checks whether the middle element is equal to the target at the end of the search. On average, this eliminates half a comparison from each iteration. This slightly cuts the time taken per iteration on most computers. However, it guarantees that the search takes the maximum number of iterations, on average adding one iteration to the search. Because the comparison loop is performed only <math display=\\\"inline\\\">\\\\lfloor \\\\log_2 (n) + 1 \\\\rfloor</math> times in the worst case, the slight increase in efficiency per iteration does not compensate for the extra iteration for all but very large <math display=\\\"inline\\\">n</math>.{{Efn|{{Harvnb|Knuth|1998}} showed on his [[MIX (abstract machine)|MIX]] computer model, which Knuth designed as a representation of an ordinary computer, that the average running time of this variation for a successful search is <math display=\\\"inline\\\">17.5 \\\\log_2 n + 17</math> units of time compared to <math display=\\\"inline\\\">18 \\\\log_2 n - 16</math> units for regular binary search. The time complexity for this variation grows slightly more slowly, but at the cost of higher initial complexity. {{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Exercise 23\\\"}}}}{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Exercise 23\\\"}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rolfe|first1=Timothy J.|s2cid=23752485|title=Analytic derivation of comparisons in binary search|journal=ACM SIGNUM Newsletter|date=1997|volume=32|issue=4|pages=15\\u201319|doi=10.1145/289251.289255|doi-access=free}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Running time and cache use ===\\nIn analyzing the performance of binary search, another consideration is the time required to compare two elements. For integers and strings, the time required increases linearly as the encoding length (usually the number of [[bit]]s) of the elements increase. For example, comparing a pair of 64-bit unsigned integers would require comparing up to double the bits as comparing a pair of 32-bit unsigned integers. The worst case is achieved when the integers are equal. This can be significant when the encoding lengths of the elements are large, such as with large integer types or long strings, which makes comparing elements expensive. Furthermore, comparing [[Floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] values (the most common digital representation of [[real number]]s) is often more expensive than comparing integers or short strings.\\n\\nOn most computer architectures, the [[Central processing unit|processor]] has a hardware [[Cache (computing)|cache]] separate from [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. Since they are located within the processor itself, caches are much faster to access but usually store much less data than RAM. Therefore, most processors store memory locations that have been accessed recently, along with memory locations close to it. For example, when an array element is accessed, the element itself may be stored along with the elements that are stored close to it in RAM, making it faster to sequentially access array elements that are close in index to each other ([[locality of reference]]). On a sorted array, binary search can jump to distant memory locations if the array is large, unlike algorithms (such as [[linear search]] and [[linear probing]] in [[hash tables]]) which access elements in sequence. This adds slightly to the running time of binary search for large arrays on most systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khuong|first1=Paul-Virak|last2=Morin|first2=Pat|s2cid=23752485|author2-link= Pat Morin |title=Array Layouts for Comparison-Based Searching|journal=Journal of Experimental Algorithmics|year=2017|volume=22|at=Article 1.3|doi=10.1145/3053370|arxiv=1509.05053}}</ref>\\n\\n== Binary search versus other schemes ==\\nSorted arrays with binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval, taking <math display=\\\"inline\\\">O(n)</math> time for each such operation.

For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as [[van Emde Boas tree]]s, [[fusion tree]]s, [[trie]]s, and [[bit array]]s. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute.<ref name=\\\"pred\\\" /> As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.<ref name=\\\"judyarray\\\" />\\n\\n== Variations ==\\n\\n=== Uniform binary search ===\\n{{Main|Uniform binary search}}\\n[[File:Uniform binary search.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[Uniform binary search]] stores the difference between the current and the two next possible middle elements instead of specific bounds.]]\\nUniform binary search stores, instead of the lower and upper bounds, the difference in the index of the middle element from the current iteration to the next iteration. A [[lookup table]] containing the differences is computed beforehand. For example, if the array to be searched is {{math|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]}}, the middle element (<math>m</math>) would be {{math|6}}. In this case, the middle element of the left subarray ({{math|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}}) is {{math|3}} and the middle element of the right subarray ({{math|[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]}}) is {{math|9}}. Uniform binary search would store the value of {{math|3}} as both indices differ from {{math|6}} by this same amount.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"An important variation\\\"}} To reduce the search space, the algorithm either adds or subtracts this change from the index of the middle element. Uniform binary search may be faster on systems where it is inefficient to calculate the midpoint, such as on [[decimal computer]]s.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Algorithm U\\\"}}\\n\\n=== Exponential search{{anchor|One-sided search}} ===\\n{{Main|Exponential search}}\\n[[File:Exponential search.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Visualization of [[exponential search]]ing finding the upper bound for the subsequent binary search]]\\nExponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. It starts by finding the first element with an index that is both a power of two and greater than the target value. Afterwards, it sets that index as the upper bound, and switches to binary search. A search takes <math display=\\\"inline\\\">\\\\lfloor \\\\log_2 x + 1\\\\rfloor</math> iterations before binary search is started and at most <math display=\\\"inline\\\">\\\\lfloor \\\\log_2 x \\\\rfloor</math> iterations of the binary search, where <math display=\\\"inline\\\">x</math> is the position of the target value.

Other implementations may specify another function for estimating the target's location.]]\\nInstead of calculating the midpoint, interpolation search estimates the position of the target value, taking into account the lowest and highest elements in the array as well as length of the array. It works on the basis that the midpoint is not the best guess in many cases. For example, if the target value is close to the highest element in the array, it is likely to be located near the end of the array.{{Sfn|Knuth|1998|loc=\\u00a76.2.1 (\\\"Searching an ordered table\\\"), subsection \\\"Interpolation search\\\"}}\\n\\nA common interpolation function is [[linear interpolation]].

Binary search trees are one such generalization&mdash;when a vertex (node) in the tree is queried, the algorithm either learns that the vertex is the target, or otherwise which subtree the target would be located in. However, this can be further generalized as follows: given an undirected, positively weighted graph and a target vertex, the algorithm learns upon querying a vertex that it is equal to the target, or it is given an incident edge that is on the shortest path from the queried vertex to the target. The standard binary search algorithm is simply the case where the graph is a path. Similarly, binary search trees are the case where the edges to the left or right subtrees are given when the queried vertex is unequal to the target. For all undirected, positively weighted graphs, there is an algorithm that finds the target vertex in <math>O(\\\\log n)</math> queries in the worst case.<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Emamjomeh-Zadeh|first1=Ehsan|last2=Kempe|first2=David|last3=Singhal|first3=Vikrant|title=Deterministic and probabilistic binary search in graphs|date=2016|pages=519\\u2013532|conference=48th [[Symposium on Theory of Computing|ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing]]|arxiv=1503.00805|doi=10.1145/2897518.2897656}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Noisy binary search ===\\n[[File:Noisy binary search.svg|thumb|right|In noisy binary search, there is a certain probability that a comparison is incorrect.]]\\nNoisy binary search algorithms solve the case where the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array.

The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought on a [[Promontory of Quebec|plateau]] by the British Army and Royal Navy against the French Army, just outside the [[Ramparts of Quebec City|walls of Quebec City]] on land that was originally owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops in total, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between [[France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] over the fate of [[New France]], influencing the later creation of [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishbattles.com/battle-of-quebec.htm |title=Battle of Quebec |year=2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218174313/http://www.britishbattles.com/battle-of-quebec.htm |archive-date=18 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}</ref>\\n\\nThe culmination of a three-month [[siege]] by the British, the battle lasted about an hour. British troops commanded by General [[James Wolfe]] successfully resisted the [[Column (formation)|column]] advance of French troops and [[Canada (New France)|Canadian]] militia under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|Louis-Joseph, Marquis de Montcalm]], employing new tactics that proved extremely effective against standard military formations used in most large European conflicts. Both generals were mortally wounded during the battle; Wolfe died of gunshot wounds just as the French began to retreat and Montcalm died the next morning after receiving a [[musket ball]] wound just below his ribs. In the wake of the battle, the French evacuated the city.\\n\\nThe French forces would attempt to recapture Quebec the following spring, and in the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]], they forced the British to retreat within the walls. However, the French [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|failed to take the city]] and in 1763, following defeat in the [[Montreal campaign]], France [[Cession|ceded]] most of its possessions in eastern North America to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].\\n\\nThe decisive success of the British forces on the Plains of Abraham and the subsequent capture of Quebec became part of what was known in Great Britain as the \\\"[[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|Annus Mirabilis]]\\\" of 1759.\\n\\n==Overview==\\n[[Image:General-james-wolfe.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Wolfe printed ''circa'' 1776]]\\n\\nAs the [[Seven Years' War]] entered its later stages through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attack from British armies. In 1758 after their defeat in July at the [[Battle of Carillon]], the British took [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Louisbourg]] in August, causing Atlantic Canada to fall into their hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. The British also captured [[Fort Frontenac]] in the same month, costing the French supplies for the [[Ohio Valley]] campaign. When some of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] supporters of the French made peace with the British, France was forced to draw its troops back. The French leaders, specifically Governor [[Pierre Fran\\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal|de Vaudreuil]] and General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|Montcalm]], were unsettled by the British successes.

In addition, a screen of trees along the Montmorency River made an approach on that route dangerous.<ref>{{Harvnb|Casgrain|1905|p=109}}.</ref> On 31 July, the first serious attempt by Wolfe's troops to land on the northern shore led to the [[Battle of Beauport]], also known as the Battle of Montmorency. Approximately 3,500 troops, supported by a heavy bombardment, attempted to land but were fired upon in the river shallows. Members of the [[Louisbourg Grenadiers]], who reached the beach, attempted a generally undisciplined charge on the French positions, but came under heavy fire; a thunderstorm ended the fight and allowed Wolfe to pull his troops back after taking some 450 casualties to Montcalm's 60.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|pp=35\\u201342}}.</ref>\\n\\nSome French officers felt the Montmorency defeat would be the last British attack; Vaudreuil wrote afterwards that \\\"I have no more anxiety about Quebec.

Wolfe's troops, along with [[United States Army Rangers#Early Rangers|American Rangers]], attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the St. Lawrence. An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm's army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=180}}.</ref> However, the attacks did reduce the number of suppliers available to the French, especially as the British navy, unable to control the St. Lawrence entirely, was successful in blockading the ports in France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=44}}.</ref>\\n\\n==Preparations==\\n[[Image:plains2009.jpg|thumb|left|The Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]\\nThrough the summer siege, illness spread through the British camps. In August, Wolfe himself was bedridden, causing already low morale to slump even further among the British troops.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|pp=104\\u2013107}}.</ref> With many men in camp hospitals, British fighting numbers were thinned, and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed by the end of September, or Britain's opportunity would be lost.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=201}}.</ref> In addition, his frustration with Montcalm's defensive stance continued to grow. In a letter to his mother, Wolfe wrote, \\\"The Marquis of Montcalm is at the head of a great number of bad soldiers, and I am at the head of a small number of good ones that wish for nothing so much as to fight him; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behaviour of his army.\\\" Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege, relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted, and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Casgrain|1905|p=157}}.</ref>\\n\\nAfter considering and rejecting a number of plans for landings on the north shore, a decision was made in late August by Wolfe and his brigadiers to land upriver of the city. If successful, such a landing would force Montcalm to fight, as a British force on the north shore of the St. Lawrence would cut his supply lines to Montreal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=181}}.</ref> Initial suggestions for landing sites ranged as far as {{cvt|32|km|mi}} up the St. Lawrence, which would have given the French troops one or two days to prepare for the attack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=50}}.</ref> Following the failed British assault on [[Battle of Beauport|Montmorency]], Montcalm altered his deployment, sending [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]] and a column of approximately 1,500 regular troops, 200 cavalry, and a group of New French militia\\u2014some 3,000 men in all\\u2014upriver to [[Cap-Rouge, Quebec|Cap-Rouge]] to monitor the British ships upstream.  He further strengthened his defences of the [[Beauport, Quebec City|Beauport]] shore following the abandonment of the British camp at Montmorency, which he regarded as preparations for a descent (amphibious attack) on Beauport.  In spite of warnings from local commanders, he did not view an upstream landing as a serious possibility.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|p=78}}.</ref>\\n[[File:Fleuve Saint-Laurent a Quebec.jpg|thumb|Anse au Foulon]]\\n\\nThe British, meanwhile, prepared for their risky deployment upstream.  Troops had already been aboard landing ships and drifting up and down the river for several days<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=125}}.</ref> when Wolfe on 12 September, made a final decision on the British landing site, selecting L'[[Anse-au-Foulon]].  L'Anse-au-Foulon is a cove situated west of the city, three kilometres upstream from [[Cap Diamant]].  It lies at the bottom of a {{cvt|53|m|ft|adj=on}} high cliff leading to the plateau above, and was protected by a battery of guns. It is not known why Wolfe selected Foulon, as the original landing site was to be further up the river, in a position where the British would be able to develop a foothold and strike at Bougainville's force to draw Montcalm out of Quebec and onto the plains. Brigadier-General [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]] wrote that \\\"by some intelligence the General had, he has changed his mind as to the place he intended to land\\\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=121}}.</ref> In his final letter, dated {{HMS|Sutherland|1741|6}}, 8:30&nbsp;p.m. 12 September, Wolfe wrote:\\n{{Quote|I had the honour to inform you today that it is my duty to attack the French army. To the best of my knowledge and ability, I have fixed upon that spot where we can act with most force and are most likely to succeed. If I am mistaken I am sorry for it and must be answerable to His Majesty and the public for the consequences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1959|p=117}}.</ref>}}\\n\\nWolfe's plan of attack depended on secrecy and surprise.  His plan required that a small party of men should land by night on the north shore, climb the [[Promontory of Quebec]], seize a small road, and overpower the garrison that protected it, allowing the bulk of his army (5,000 men) to ascend the cliff by the small road and then deploy for battle on the plateau.  Even if the first landing party succeeded in their mission and the army was able to follow, such a deployment would still leave his forces inside the French line of defence with no immediate retreat but the river.  It is possible that Wolfe's decision to change the landing site was owing less to a desire for secrecy and more to his general disdain for his brigadiers (a feeling that was reciprocated); it is also possible that he was still suffering the effects of his illness and the [[opiate]]s he used as painkillers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|p=353}}.</ref> Some revisionist historians believe Wolfe ordered the attack believing the advanced guard would be repulsed, and anticipated dying gallantly with his men rather than returning home in disgrace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anderson|2000|pp=354, 789}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Brumwell|2006|pp=269}}.</ref>\\n\\n==Order of battle==\\n{{wide image|Battle of Quebec 1759 SLNSW FL3542480.jpg|900px|Plan of Quebec and environs  with its defences and the occasional entrenched camps of the French commanded by Marquis de Montcalm shewing likewise the principal works and operations of the British forces, under the command of Major General Wolfe, during the siege of that place in 1759.}}\\n=== British forces ===\\nBritish forces engaged in the battle were commanded by [[Major General]] [[James Wolfe]] who commanded appx. 8,000 troops, of which only 4,500 men and 1  artillery gun were taken to the [[Plains of Abraham]].<ref name=\\\":0\\\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishbattles.com/french-indian-war/battle-of-quebec-1759/ |title=Battle of Quebec 1759 |website=www.britishbattles.com |access-date=2020-02-25 |archive-date=30 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130142530/https://www.britishbattles.com/french-indian-war/battle-of-quebec-1759/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\\\":1\\\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/index.php?title=1759-09-13_-_Battle_of_Qu%C3%A9bec#Order_of_Battle |title=1759-09-13 \\u2013 Battle of Qu\\u00e9bec \\u2013 Project Seven Years War |website=www.kronoskaf.com |access-date=2020-02-25 |archive-date=25 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200925190426/http://www.kronoskaf.com/syw/index.php?title=1759-09-13_-_Battle_of_Qu%C3%A9bec#Order_of_Battle |url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n'''British Army'''\\n* ''En potence'' on the right flank \\u2013 [[35th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* In reserve \\u2013 [[48th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* Protecting rear \\u2013 The Light Infantry ([[80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot]])\\n\\n'''Main Line''' under [[Major General]] [[James Wolfe]]\\n* [[Louisbourg Grenadiers]] (3 Companies)\\n* [[22nd Regiment of Foot]] (only grenadier and light infantry companies)\\n* [[40th Regiment of Foot]] (only grenadier and light infantry companies)\\n* [[45th Regiment of Foot]]\\n\\n'''Right Wing''' under [[Brigadier General]] [[Robert Monckton]]\\n* [[28th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* [[43rd Regiment of Foot]]\\n* 1 Light field gun provided by [[Royal Artillery]]\\n\\n'''Centre''' under [[Brigadier General]] [[James Murray (British Army officer, born 1721)|James Murray]]\\n* [[47th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* [[58th Regiment of Foot]] (also guarding the landing place)\\n* [[Fraser's Highlanders|78th (Fraser's) Highlanders]]\\n* 1 Light field gun provided by [[Royal Artillery]]\\n\\n'''Left Flank''' under [[Brigadier General]] [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]]\\n* [[15th Regiment of Foot]]\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot]]\\n* 3rd Battalion, [[60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot]]\\n\\n'''Colonials'''\\n* The Light Infantry ([[80th Regiment of Light-Armed Foot]]) (protecting the rear)\\n* 6 Companies of [[American Rangers]]\\n\\n=== French forces ===\\nFrench forces engaged in the battle were commanded by [[Major General]] [[Marquis De Montcalm|Louis Joseph de Saint V\\u00e9ran, Marquis de Montcalm]] commanding appx. 1,900 regulars, 1,500 militia and natives, and 4 field guns.<ref name=\\\":0\\\" /><ref name=\\\":1\\\" />\\n\\n'''Right Wing''' commanded by General Dumas\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de la Sarre]]\\n* [[Montr\\u00e9al]] and [[Qu\\u00e9bec]] Militia\\n* 2 field guns\\n\\n'''Centre''' under [[Major General]] [[Marquis De Montcalm|Louis Joseph de Saint V\\u00e9ran, Marquis de Montcalm]]\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de Languedoc]]\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de B\\u00e9arn]] (deep order, meaning they were not spread out)\\n\\n'''Left Wing''' under General Senezergues\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment de Guyenne]] (deep order)\\n* 2nd Battalion, [[R\\u00e9giment Royal Roussillon]]\\n* [[Montr\\u00e9al]] and [[Trois-Rivi\\u00e8res]] Militia\\n* 2 field guns\\n\\n==Landing==\\n[[File:Battle of the Plains of Abraham 1.svg|thumb|left|Landing of the British troops on 12 September]]\\nBougainville, tasked with the defence of the large area between [[Cap Diamant]] and [[Cap-Rouge, Quebec City|Cap Rouge]], was upstream with his troops at Cap Rouge on the night of 12 September, and missed seeing numerous British ships moving downstream.  A camp of approximately 100 militia led by Captain [[Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor]], who had unsuccessfully faced the British four years previously at [[Fort Beaus\\u00e9jour]], had been assigned to watch the narrow road at L'Anse-au-Foulon which followed a [[streambank]], the [[Coul\\u00e9e]] Saint-Denis.

A group of 24 volunteers led by Colonel [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] with fixed [[bayonet]]s were sent to clear the picket along the road, and climbed the slope, a manoeuvre that allowed them to come up behind Vergor's camp and capture it quickly.  Wolfe followed an hour later when he could use an easy access road to climb to the plain. Thus, by the time the sun rose over the Plains of Abraham, Wolfe's army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs of the [[promontory of Quebec]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|pp=58\\u201361}}.</ref>\\n\\n==Battle==\\n[[Image:NSRW Siege of Quebec.png|left|thumb|Map of the Quebec City area showing disposition of French and British forces.

Had the immediate defenders been more numerous, the British might have been unable to deploy or even been pushed back.

Many of the militia were inexperienced; the Acadian, Canadian, and indigenous [[irregulars]] were more used to guerrilla warfare. By contrast, the British 7,700 troops were almost all [[Regular Army|regulars]].\\n\\nOn the morning of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with their backs to the river, then spread out across the Plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=61}}.</ref>\\n\\nOf the British troops, approximately 3,300 formed into a shallow [[horseshoe]] formation that stretched across the width of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and [[gristmill]] to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire to keep them out of enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to the width of the lines.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1959|p=148}}.</ref> As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reid|2003|p=69}}.</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:Montcalm leading his troops at the Plains of Abraham.jpg|thumb|Montcalm leading his troops into battle. Watercolour by [[Charles William Jefferys]] (1869\\u20131951)]]\\nAs French troops arrived from Beauport, Montcalm, one of few mounted men on the field, decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the British from their position.  Accordingly, he deployed the forces immediately available in and near Quebec City and prepared an immediate attack, without waiting for further reinforcements from the Beauport shore.  He arrayed his approximately 3,500 soldiers into place, his best regulars three deep, others six deep and his poorest regiment in column. At approximately 10&nbsp;a.m., Montcalm, riding his dark horse and waving his sword to encourage his men,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chartrand|1999|p=86}}.</ref> ordered a general advance on the British line.\\n\\nAs a European-trained military leader, Montcalm's instinct was for large, set-piece battles in which regiments and soldiers moved in precise order.  Such actions required a disciplined soldiery, painstakingly drilled for as long as 18 months on the parade ground, trained to march in time, change formation at a word, and retain cohesion in the face of bayonet charges and musket volleys.<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 197\\\"/> Though his regular regiments (the \\\"troupes de terre\\\" or \\\"metropolitans\\\") were adept at such formal warfare, in the course of the campaign their ranks had been replenished by less professional militiamen, whose talents at forest warfare emphasised the individual: they tended to fire early and then drop to the ground to reload, thus reducing the effect of concentrated fire at close range.<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 182\\\">{{Harvnb|Eccles|1969|p=182}}.</ref>\\n\\n===Main engagement===\\n[[File:Battle of the Plains of Abraham 3.svg|thumb|left|French forces in retreat]]\\nAs the French approached, the British lines held their fire.

James Murray, the British commander, had experienced a terrible winter, in which scurvy had reduced his garrison to only 4,000. On 28 April, L\\u00e9vis' forces met and defeated the British at the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]], immediately west of the city (near the site of [[Universit\\u00e9 Laval]] today). This battle proved bloodier than that of the Plains of Abraham, with about 850 casualties on the French side and 1,100 on the British side. The French had defeated the British, but the British were able to withdraw within the walls of Quebec, to which the French [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|laid siege]]. A lack of artillery and ammunition, combined with British improvements to the fortifications, meant that the French were unable to take the city by storm. Both sides awaited reinforcements from Europe. The first ships to arrive, in mid-May, were part of a British fleet which had [[Battle of Neuville|defeated Levis' support ships]].<ref name=\\\"Eccles, pp. 182\\\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|Jones|Smith|2000|pp=142\\u2013143}}.</ref> The success of the French army's offensive against Quebec in the spring of 1760 had depended on the dispatch of a French armada, with fresh troops and supplies.<ref name=\\\"Francis, Origins, pp. 142\\\" /> A naval battle fought at [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]], just off the coast of France, proved the decisive battle for this part of New France.

This website is not the official website of the event.</ref> A plan to hold a re-enactment of the battle itself (as well as a re-enactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]]) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as a slap in the face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/organizers-cancel-mock-battle-of-the-plains-of-abraham-1.787562 |title=CBC News: Organizers cancel mock Battle of the Plains of Abraham |access-date=24 September 2018 |archive-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027142038/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/organizers-cancel-mock-battle-of-the-plains-of-abraham-1.787562 |url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\nAnother commemorative event was proposed for the anniversary, the ''Moulin \\u00e0 paroles''.

cruiser]] that was built for the [[Royal Navy]]. She is now permanently moored as a [[museum ship]] on the [[River Thames]] in [[London]] and is operated by the [[Imperial War Museum]].\\n\\nConstruction of ''Belfast'', the first ship in the Royal Navy to be named after the capital city of [[Northern Ireland]] and one of ten Town-class cruisers, began in December 1936. She was launched on [[St Patrick's Day]] 1938. Commissioned in early August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], ''Belfast'' was initially part of the British naval blockade against Germany. In November 1939, ''Belfast'' struck a German [[naval mine|mine]] and, in spite of fears that she would be scrapped, spent more than two years undergoing extensive repairs. ''Belfast'' returned to action in November 1942 with improved firepower, radar equipment, and armour. ''Belfast'' saw action escorting [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] to the [[Soviet Union]] during 1943 and in December 1943 played an important role in the [[Battle of North Cape]], assisting in the destruction of the German warship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}. In June 1944, ''Belfast'' took part in [[Operation Overlord]] supporting the [[Normandy landings]]. In June 1945, she was redeployed to the Far East to join the [[British Pacific Fleet]], arriving shortly before the end of the Second World War. ''Belfast'' saw further combat action in {{nowrap|1950\\u201352}} during the [[Korean War]] and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959. A number of further overseas commissions followed before she entered reserve in 1963.\\n\\nIn 1967, efforts were initiated to avert ''Belfast''{{'s}} expected scrapping and to preserve her as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]], and the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] was established and then reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971, however, the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS ''Belfast'' Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near [[Tower Bridge]] in the [[Pool of London]]. Opened to the public in October 1971, ''Belfast'' became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978. Since 1973 she has been home to the [[Sea Cadets (United Kingdom)|City of London Sea Cadets]] who meet on board twice a week.<ref>{{Cite web  |url=https://www.sea-cadets.org/cityoflondon/get-in-touch |title=Get in touch |website=City of London Sea Cadets}}</ref> A popular tourist attraction, ''Belfast'' received over 327,000 visitors in 2019.<ref name=\\\"ALVA 2019 visitor numbers\\\">{{cite web |title=ALVA \\u2013 Association of Leading Visitor Attractions |url=https://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423 |website=www.alva.org.uk |access-date=28 October 2020}}</ref> As a branch of a national museum and part of the [[National Historic Fleet]], ''Belfast'' is supported by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], admissions income, and the museum's commercial activities.\\n\\n==Design==\\n[[File:HMS Belfast shells1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=\\\"A circular rack of conical shells.

The Town class had originated in 1933 as the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]]'s response to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{sclass|Mogami|cruiser|2}}, an {{formatnum:11200}}-ton cruiser mounting fifteen {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns with a top speed exceeding {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}}. The Admiralty's [[requirement]] called for a 9,000-ton cruiser, sufficiently armoured to withstand a direct hit from an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|0}} shell, capable of {{convert|32|kn|km/h}} and mounting twelve 6-inch guns. Seaplanes carried aboard would enable shipping lanes to be patrolled over a wide area, and the class was also to be capable of its own anti-aircraft defence.{{sfn|Wingate |2004 |p=7}} Under the [[Director of Naval Construction]] the new design evolved during 1933.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=6}} The lead ship of the new class, the 9,100-ton {{HMS|Southampton|83|6}}, and her [[Sister ship|sister]] {{HMS|Newcastle|C76|6}}, were ordered under the 1933 estimates.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=8}} Three more cruisers were built to this design, with a further three ships built to a slightly larger 9,400-ton design in 1935\\u201336.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=8}} By 1935, however, the Admiralty was keen to improve the firepower of these cruisers to match the firepower of the Japanese ''Mogami'' and American {{sclass|Brooklyn|cruiser|2}}s; both were armed with fifteen 6-inch guns.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=6}} The Admiralty rejected a design featuring five triple turrets as impractical, while an alternative design fitting four quadruple turrets was rejected as an effective quadruple turret could not be developed.{{sfn|Watton|1985|pp=6\\u20137}} In May 1936 the Admiralty decided to fit triple turrets, whose improved design would permit an increase in deck armour.{{sfn|Watton|1985|p=7}} This modified design became the 10,000-ton ''Edinburgh'' subclass, named after ''Belfast''{{'}}s sister ship {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}}.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=8}} ''Belfast'' was ordered from [[Harland and Wolff]] on 21 September 1936,{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}} and her keel laid on 10 December 1936.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}} Her expected cost was \\u00a32,141,514; of which the guns cost \\u00a375,000 and the aircraft (two [[Supermarine Walrus]]es) \\u00a366,500.<ref name=IWM1>{{cite web |url=http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.125 |title=History of HMS Belfast: Building and Launch |year=2009 |website=Imperial War Museum |access-date=8 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080612093723/http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.125 |archive-date=12 June 2008}}</ref> She was launched on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], 17 March 1938, by [[Anne Chamberlain]], the wife of Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}} The launch was filmed by [[Path\\u00e9 News]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mrs-chamberlain-opens-new-airport-at-belfast-and-l |title=Mrs Chamberlain Opens New Airport At Belfast And Launches HMS Belfast (1938) |website=British Path\\u00e9 |access-date=15 March 2013}}</ref> From March to August 1939, ''Belfast'' was fitted out and underwent sea trials.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=9}}\\n\\n[[File:HMS Belfast - Boiler diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of one of ''Belfast''{{'}}s boilers.]]When completed, ''Belfast'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|613|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|63|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|17|ft|3|in|m|1}}.

Her first captain was [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] G A Scott with a crew of 761, and her first assignment was to the [[Home Fleet]]'s [[2nd Cruiser Squadron]]. On 14 August, ''Belfast'' took part in her first exercise, Operation [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Hipper'']], in which she played the role of a German [[commerce raider]] attempting to escape into the Atlantic. By navigating the hazardous [[Pentland Firth]], ''Belfast'' successfully evaded the Home Fleet.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|p=33}}\\n\\nOn 31 August 1939 ''Belfast'' was transferred to the [[18th Cruiser Squadron]]. Based at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney]] islands, 18th Cruiser Squadron was part of the British effort to impose a naval [[blockade]] on Germany. Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] the following day, and Britain and France declared war on 3 September.

On the morning following the sinking, ''Belfast'' left for [[Loch Ewe]].{{sfn|Lavery |2015 |p=85-86}}\\n\\nOn 10 November ''Belfast'' was taken off the northern patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at [[Rosyth]]. On 21 November, ''Belfast'' was to take part in the force's first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58&nbsp;am she detonated a magnetic [[naval mine|mine]] while leaving the [[Firth of Forth]].

Bruce Fraser, C-in-C Home Fleet, expected and hoped that the German battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} would sortie from its Norwegian base and attempt to attack Convoy JW 55B sailing from Scotland to Murmansk in the USSR. And indeed, on 25 December 1943, Christmas Day, ''Scharnhorst'' left port in northern Norway to attack Convoy JW 55B. The next day Force One, which had left Murmansk on the 23rd, encountered ''Scharnhorst'', prevented her from attacking the convoy, and forced her to retreat after being damaged by the British cruisers. As ''Scharnhorst'' attacked again at noon she was intercepted by Force Two and sunk by the combined formations. ''Belfast'' played an important role in the battle; as flagship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, she was among the first to encounter ''Scharnhorst'', and coordinated the squadron's defence of the convoy. After ''Scharnhorst'' turned away from the convoy, Admiral Burnett in ''Belfast'' shadowed her by radar from outside visual range, enabling her interception by ''Duke of York''.{{sfn|Wingate|2004|pp=44\\u201355}}\\n\\n===1944: ''Tirpitz'' and D-Day===\\nAfter North Cape, ''Belfast'' refuelled at [[Kola Inlet]] before sailing for the United Kingdom, arriving at Scapa to replenish her fuel, ammunition and stores on New Year's Day 1944.

Changes included: individual MRS8 directors for the new twin Mk 5 40&nbsp;mm and the twin 4-inch mount; the 4-inch guns training and elevation speed was increased to 20 degrees per second; and protecting key parts of the ship against [[Weapon of mass destruction|nuclear, biological or chemical]] attack.

Her boiler rooms were also given remote control so they could still be run in the event of a nuclear, biological or chemical attack as the boiler rooms themselves were not protected. The most significant change was better accommodations for a smaller crew more fitting of post-war needs. Her tripod masts were replaced with lattice masts and timber decking replaced with steel everywhere except the quarterdeck.

Only one of the ship's two boiler rooms would be used, which together with the reductions in armament would allow the ship's crew to be reduced so freeing up space to carry troops. Two infantry [[Company (military unit)|companies]], 30 officers and 230 other ranks, would be carried.

Griffin]], the chairman of the [[House Committee on Military Affairs]], ranking first out of 62 applicants for the appointment.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=3}}</ref> To enter, Casey claimed to be slightly older, adopting his brother's 7 June birthday.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. 5\\\"/>\\n\\nCasey entered West Point in 1915, where his best friend and roommate was [[Lucius D. Clay]]. At West Point, Casey played [[American football|football]] as a [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]], substituting for [[Elmer Oliphant]]. One of Casey's duties was tutoring Oliphant in mathematics. Casey decided that winning games was more important than playing, and he helped keep Oliphant proficient at math. Unlike most appointees to West Point, a grateful Casey wrote frequently to Griffin about his progress and sent him football tickets. When Casey's younger brother Martin Charles Casey wanted to enter West Point, Griffin directly appointed him to the class of 1920 without having to pass the examination. Martin served with the [[coastal artillery]] for eleven years before being medically discharged due to [[migraine]] headaches on 30 November 1931. Martin later graduated from Stanford Law School and became a successful lawyer.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=5\\u20137}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Cullum|1940|p=477}}</ref> Both brothers acquired the nickname \\\"Pat\\\" at West Point.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=98}}</ref>\\n\\n==World War I==\\nBecause of the United States' entry into [[World War I]], Casey's class graduated early on 12 June 1918.

Casey took over the task of preparing a voluminous report on flood control. The Corps of Engineers was criticized by the Pittsburgh Flood Control Commission for over-engineering, in planning for a \\\"flood that had never happened and never would happen\\\", and the report was shelved. However, [[Pittsburgh Flood of 1936|in 1936 the flood did happen]]. The report was then dusted off and its recommendations were adopted. The [[Flood Control Act of 1936]] assigned responsibility for flood control to the Corps of Engineers and other Federal agencies.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=76\\u201379}}</ref> Casey was also responsible for construction at Deadman Island Lock and Dam (now called the [[Dashields Locks and Dam]]) on the [[Ohio River]].<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1929|pp=444\\u2013451}}</ref>\\n\\nIn September 1929 Casey was assigned to the Rivers and Harbors Section of the Office of the Chief of Engineers in [[Washington, DC]]. This job involved reviewing the project studies, plans and specifications of all river and harbor projects throughout the United States, including flood control and [[hydroelectric power]] projects. He also had responsibility for correspondence with [[U.S. senators]] and congressmen.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=23}}</ref> During this time he co-designed and patented the Kingman-Casey Floating Mooring Bit for navigation locks.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. xiv\\\"/><ref>US Patent no. 1,997,586, dated 16 April 1935</ref> He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 1 May 1933.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. xiii\\\">{{harvnb|Casey|1993|p=xiii}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey won a John R.

For the next two years, he attended the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|''Technische Hochschule'' in Berlin]], earning a [[Doctor of Engineering|Doctorate in Engineering]]. His thesis, written in German, was on ''Geschieb Bewegung'', the bedload movement in streams.<ref>{{cite web |title=''\\u00dcber Geschiebebewegung'' |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=+bibliogroup:%22Mitteilungen+der+Preu%C3%9Fischen+Versuchsanstalt+f%C3%BCr+Wasserbau+und+Schiffbau%22 |publisher=Preussische Druckerei-und Verlags-Aktiengesellschaft |access-date=22 June 2010 |language=de }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=99\\u2013100}}</ref> Returning to the United States in June 1935, Casey was posted to [[Eastport, Maine]] as chief of the Engineering Division at the [[Passamaquoddy Bay#The Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project/\\\"Quoddy Dam\\\" Project|Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project]], a [[New Deal]] public works project.

They worked with [[Meralco]] and other power companies in the Philippines, and conducted a series of surveys, including a detailed one of the [[Agno River]]. After Clay returned to the United States, Casey developed plans for the [[Caliraya Dam]], a  {{convert|40000|hp|kW}} hydroelectric project with an estimated cost of $5 million.

A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new [[triangular division]], 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the [[cantonment]] areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=347\\u2013354}}</ref> Casey was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on 8 April 1941.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. xiii\\\"/>\\n\\nOn the afternoon of Thursday, 17 July 1941, Somervell summoned Casey and Bergstrom and gave them a new special project: the design of an enormous office complex to house the [[United States Department of War|War Department's]] 40,000-person staff together in one building. Somervell gave them until 09:00 on Monday morning to design the building, which he envisaged as a modern, four-story structure with no elevators, on the site of the old [[Hoover Field|Washington Hoover Airport]].  This would ultimately become [[The Pentagon]], the largest office building in the world.  Over that \\\"very busy weekend\\\", Casey, Bergstrom and their staff roughed out the design for a four-story, five-sided structure with a floor area of {{convert|5100000|sqft|sqm}}\\u2014twice that of the [[Empire State Building]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=431 }}</ref> The estimated cost was $35 million.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=432}}</ref> [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D.

Casey.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Major General Hugh J. Casey at his desk in Brisbane|alt=A name plaque reads: \\\"Maj. Gen. Hugh J. Casey\\\". The wall behind him is covered in huge map of New Guinea.]]\\nIn [[Australia]], Casey became Chief Engineer at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ), [[Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA). He faced enormous engineering challenges. Most of [[New Guinea]] consisted of mountains and jungle, with very few airstrips, ports or roads. All of these had to be developed to support operations. To provide additional expertise in construction, Casey had [[Leif Sverdrup]] assigned to his staff as chief of the Construction Section, with the rank of colonel. As U.S. Army engineers were few, Casey worked closely with his [[Australian Army]] counterpart at [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]]'s Allied Land Forces headquarters, [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[Clive Steele]]. Construction activities in Australia were also undertaken by civilians of the [[Allied Works Council]]. Casey attempted to coordinate the activities of the various agencies. He had to fend off attempts by the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was Casey able to control their activities.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=130\\u2013137}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey's initial need was for engineer units to accomplish the daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of [[tractor]]s, [[grader]]s, [[concrete mixer]]s and [[welding]] equipment. In the absence of a proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.\\n<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=260\\u2013}}</ref>\\n\\nIn September 1942, MacArthur decided to outflank Japanese troops on the [[Kokoda Trail]] by sending an American [[regimental combat team]] over the [[Owen Stanley Range]]. Two alternate means of crossing the mountains seemed possible. One, the [[Kapa Kapa Trail]] was known to climb to elevations above {{convert|9000|ft|m}} and present formidable obstacles. Casey and Sverdrup took charge of investigating the Abau Trail. They reached Abau on 18 September. Casey explored the harbor, taking depth soundings from a native canoe. Sverdrup set out for Jaure with a party of one American, two Australians from the [[Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit]], ten native police from the [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary|Royal Papuan Constabulary]] and 26 native carriers. After eight days on the trail, scaling heights of {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, Sverdrup concluded that it would not be practical for troops to traverse the route and turned back. Meanwhile, Casey had concluded that the harbor was too shallow even for [[lighter (barge)|lighters]]. However, the trip was not a total loss, for Sverdrup had sighted a plateau north of the Owen Stanley Range suitable for airstrips, allowing troops to be flown across the Owen Stanley Range.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=178\\u2013180}}</ref> Casey was awarded the [[Silver Star]].<ref name=\\\"medals\\\"/>\\n\\nIn New Guinea, logistics and construction activities were coordinated by task force engineer staffs. These were often hastily assembled and had not always been able to meet the demands imposed by base development in such a challenging theater of operations. The scale of operations in the Philippines was much greater, so for this purpose the Army Service Command (ASCOM) was formed in Brisbane on 23 July 1944. Casey was appointed to command ASCOM. In his absence, Sverdrup became MacArthur's chief engineer. Although part of [[USASOS]], ASCOM operated under the control of [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]], moving as far forward as combat operations allowed, developed new bases, and operated them until [[USASOS]] was ready to take over, at which point the units under ASCOM simply reverted to USASOS, allowing a seamless transfer of command.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|p=571}}</ref> For the [[Battle of Leyte]] Casey's ASCOM had 43,000 men, of whom 21,000 were engineers.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|p=575}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey and some members of his staff came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM headquarters arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at [[Tacloban City|Tacloban]], and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=579\\u2013581}}</ref> Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and it was decided to abandon their development and construct a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters. The need to get aircraft based on Leyte to stop the Japanese from reinforcing the island was so pressing that Lieutenant General [[Walter Krueger]] agreed to move his headquarters.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=583\\u2013584}}</ref>\\n\\nCasey had intended to come ashore on the first day of the [[Invasion of Lingayen Gulf|landing at Lingayen Gulf]] in January 1945 but was delayed a day because the destroyer he was traveling on had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon Base Section (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.<ref>{{harvnb|Dod|1966|pp=598\\u2013601}}</ref> For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].

Wheeler]] retired in 1948, but President [[Harry S. Truman]] passed him over in favor of the Missouri River Division Engineer, Major General [[Lewis A. Pick]]. Instead, Casey remained in Japan as MacArthur's Chief Engineer until Casey's retirement on 31 December 1949.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=270\\u2013271}}</ref> He edited ''Engineers of the Southwest Pacific'', a seven-volume series about their wartime service.<ref name=\\\"Casey, p. x\\\"/> He received a number of foreign awards for his service, including the [[Distinguished Service Star]] from the Philippines, the [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] from Australia, the Commander of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] from the Netherlands, and the Officer of [[L\\u00e9gion d'honneur]] from France.<ref>{{harvnb|Casey|1993|pp=xi\\u2013xv}}</ref>\\n\\n==Later life==\\nCasey was Chairman of the [[New York City Transit Authority]] from 1953 to 1955, and served in various positions with [[Schenley Industries]] from 1951 until his retirement in 1965.
