This is enabled by Earth being an [[ocean world]], the only one in the [[Solar System]] sustaining liquid [[surface water]]. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering [[Water distribution on Earth|70.8%]] of [[Earth's crust]]. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of [[continent]]al [[landmass]]es within Earth's [[land hemisphere]]. Most of Earth's land is somewhat [[humid]] and covered by vegetation, while large [[Ice sheet|sheets of ice]] at [[Earth's polar regions|Earth's polar]] [[desert]]s retain more water than Earth's [[groundwater]], lakes, rivers and [[Water vapor#In Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric water]] combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], which interact to produce mountain ranges, [[volcano]]es, and earthquakes. [[Earth's outer core|Earth has a liquid outer core]] that generates a [[magnetosphere]] capable of deflecting most of the destructive [[solar wind]]s and [[cosmic radiation]]. \\n\\nEarth has [[Atmosphere of Earth|a dynamic atmosphere]], which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most [[meteoroid]]s and [[Ozone layer|UV-light at entry]]. It has a composition of primarily [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. [[Water vapor]] is widely present in the atmosphere, [[Cloud#Formation|forming clouds]] that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a [[greenhouse gas]] and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of [[Solar irradiance|energy from the Sun's light]]. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of {{convert|14.76|C|F}}, at which water is liquid under normal atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the [[equatorial region]] receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive [[Atmospheric circulation|atmospheric]] and [[ocean current]]s, producing a global [[climate system]] with different [[climate region]]s, and a range of weather phenomena such as [[precipitation]], allowing components such as [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] to [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycle]].\\n\\nEarth is [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|rounded]] into [[Earth ellipsoid|an ellipsoid]] with [[Earth's circumference|a circumference]] of about 40,000&nbsp;km. It is the [[List of Solar System objects by size|densest planet in the Solar System]]. Of the four [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planets]], it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight [[light-minute]]s away from the Sun and [[Earth's orbit|orbits it]], taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|Earth's axis of rotation]] is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing [[season]]s. Earth is [[orbit]]ed by one [[Claimed moons of Earth|permanent]] [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], which [[orbit]]s Earth at 384,400&nbsp;km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon's gravity helps stabilize Earth's axis, causes [[tide]]s and [[Tidal acceleration|gradually slows Earth's rotation]]. [[Tidal locking]] has made the Moon always face Earth with the same side.\\n\\nEarth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, [[Age of Earth|formed 4.5&nbsp;billion years ago]] from gas and dust in the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|early Solar System]]. During the first billion years of [[History of Earth|Earth's history]], the ocean formed and then [[Abiogenesis|life developed]] within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the [[Great Oxidation Event]] two billion years ago. [[Human]]s emerged [[Human history|300,000 years ago]] in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth. Humans depend on Earth's [[biosphere]] and natural resources for their survival, but have [[Human impact on the environment|increasingly impacted the planet's environment]]. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is [[Sustainability|unsustainable]], threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and [[Holocene extinction|causing widespread extinctions]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=What Is Climate Change? |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change |access-date=17 August 2022 |website=United Nations |language=en |archive-date=26 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230126173023/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe [[Modern English]] word {{anchor|Name|Etymology}} ''Earth'' developed, via [[Middle English]], from an [[Old English]] noun most often spelled ''{{linktext|eor\\u00f0e}}''.<ref name=\\\"oedearth\\\">{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=3|chapter=earth, ''n.\\u00b9''|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|place=[[Oxford, England|Oxford]], England|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199571123.001.0001}}</ref> It has cognates in every [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], and their [[proto-Germanic|ancestral root]] has been reconstructed as [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/er\\u00fe\\u014d|*''er\\u00fe\\u014d'']].

Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.<ref name=\\\"earth_fact_sheet\\\" /><ref name=\\\"moon_fact_sheet\\\" />\\n\\nThe [[Hill sphere]], or the [[Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of gravitational influence]], of Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.<ref name=\\\"vazquez_etal2006\\\" /><ref group=\\\"n\\\" name=\\\"hill_radius\\\" /> This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than that of the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.<ref name=\\\"vazquez_etal2006\\\" /> Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].<ref name=\\\"nasa20051201\\\" />\\n\\n=== Axial tilt and seasons ===\\n{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}\\n[[File:axial tilt vs tropical and polar circles.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Earth's axial tilt causing different angles of seasonal illumination at different orbital positions around the Sun]]\\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281\\u00b0<ref name=\\\"IERS\\\" /> with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere.\\n\\nDuring the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rohli|first1=Robert.

In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.<ref name=\\\"bromberg2008\\\" />\\n\\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&nbsp;years.<ref name=\\\"lin2006\\\" /> The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[axial precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.<ref name=\\\"fisher19960205\\\" />\\n\\nEarth's annual orbit is elliptical rather than circular, and its closest approach to the Sun is called [[perihelion]]. In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates shift over time due to precession and changes to the orbit, the latter of which follows cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The annual change in the Earth\\u2013Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/|title=Milankovitch (Orbital) Cycles and Their Role in Earth's Climate|work=NASA|last1=Buis|first1=Alan|date=27 February 2020|access-date=27 October 2020|archive-date=30 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030105553/https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref group=\\\"n\\\" name=\\\"solar_energy\\\" /> Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/pub/seager/Kang_Seager_subm.pdf|title=Croll Revisited: Why is the Northern Hemisphere Warmer than the Southern Hemisphere?|work=Columbia University|last1=Kang|first1=Sarah M.|last2=Seager|first2=Richard|location=New York|access-date=27 October 2020|archive-date=7 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210907195739/http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/pub/seager/Kang_Seager_subm.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n== Earth\\u2013Moon system ==\\n{{Further||Satellite system (astronomy)}}\\n\\n=== Moon ===\\n{{Main|Moon|Lunar theory|Orbit of the Moon}}\\n[[File:MarsReconnaissanceOrbiter-Views-EarthMoon-20220422.jpg|thumb|Earth and the Moon as seen from [[Mars]] by the ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'']]\\n[[File:Earthrise over Compton crater -LRO full res - edit1.jpg|thumb|View of Earth from the Moon by the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]]]]\\n\\nThe Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], [[Planetary-mass moon|planet-like natural satellite]], with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's.

This also set up a process of urbanization as people of all classes were free to move jobs so people went to the city for better work. It remained influential, though less for governing than inspiring, throughout the [[Meiji era]] and into the twentieth century, and it can be considered the first [[constitution]] of modern Japan.<ref>Keene, p. 340, notes that one might \\\"describe the Oath in Five Articles as a constitution for all ages. Japan was modernized due to the Charter Oath.\\\"</ref>\\n\\n==Rules==\\nAs the name implies, the text of the Oath consists of five clauses:\\n\\n{{quotation|By this oath, we set up as our aim the establishment of the national wealth on a broad basis and the framing of a constitution and laws.\\n\\n# Deliberative assemblies shall be widely established and all matters decided by open discussion.\\n# All classes, high and low, shall be united in vigorously carrying out the administration of affairs of state.\\n# The common people, no less than the civil and military officials, shall all be allowed to pursue their own calling so that there may be no discontent.\\n# Evil customs of the past shall be broken off  and everything based upon the just laws of Nature.\\n# Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundation of imperial rule.<ref>McLaren, p. 8, quoted in De Bary ''et al.'', p. 672.</ref>}}\\n\\n==Origin and subsequent influence==\\nThe first draft of the Oath was written by junior councilor [[Yuri Kimimasa]] in January 1868, containing progressive language that spoke to the frustrations that the radical but modestly born Meiji leaders had experienced in \\\"service to hereditary incompetents.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Jansen 2002, p. 338\\\">Jansen (2002), p. 338.</ref> Yuri's language was moderated by his colleague [[Fukuoka Takachika]] in February to be \\\"less alarming,\\\" and [[Kido Takayoshi]] prepared the final form of the Oath, employing \\\"language broad enough to embrace both readings.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Jansen 2002, p. 338\\\"/> The Oath was read aloud by [[Sanj\\u014d Sanetomi]] in the main ceremonial hall of the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] in the presence of the Emperor and more than 400 officials. After the reading, the [[kuge|nobles]] and ''[[daimy\\u014d]]s'' present signed their names to a document praising the Oath, and swearing to do their utmost to uphold and implement it. Those not able to attend the formal reading afterwards visited the palace to sign their names, bringing the total number of signatures to 767.<ref>Keene, Meiji and His World, page 140</ref>\\n\\nThe purpose of the oath was both to issue a statement of policy to be followed by the post-[[Tokugawa shogunate]] government in the Meiji period, and to offer hope of inclusion in the next regime to pro-Tokugawa domains. This second motivation was especially important in the early stages of the [[Meiji Restoration|Restoration]] as a means to keep domains from joining the Tokugawa remnant in the [[Boshin War]]. Later, military victory \\\"made it safe to begin to push court nobles and ''daimy\\u014d'' figureheads out of the way\\\".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>Jansen (2002), 342.</ref>\\n\\nThe promise of reform in the document initially went unfulfilled: in particular, a parliament with real power was not established until 1890, and the [[Meiji oligarchy]] from [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]], [[Ch\\u014dsh\\u016b Domain|Ch\\u014dsh\\u016b]], [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]] and [[Hizen Domain|Hizen]] retained political and military control well into the 20th century. In general, the Oath was purposely phrased in broad terms to minimize resistance from the ''daimy\\u014ds'' and to provide \\\"a promise of gradualism and equity\\\":{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>Jansen (2002), p. 339</ref>\\n\\n{{quotation|\\\"Deliberative councils\\\" and \\\"public discourse\\\" were, after all, terms that had been applied to cooperation between lords of great domains. That \\\"all classes\\\" were to unite indicated that there would continue to be classes. Even \\\"commoners\\\" were to be treated decently by \\\"civil and military\\\" officers, the privileged ranks of the recent past. No one was likely to be in favor of the retention of \\\"evil customs\\\"; a rather Confucian \\\"Nature\\\" would indicate the path to be chosen.

There are different camping areas, each with its own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only [[campsite]]. An accessible campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. [[Tipi]]s have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired [[yurt]] sauna.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/accommodation/tipis |title=Tipis |publisher=Glastonbury Festival |access-date=31 October 2012 |archive-date=10 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110040926/http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/accommodation/tipis |url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n[[Campervan]]s, [[travel trailer|caravans]] and [[Popup camper|trailer tents]] are not allowed into the main festival site. However, the purchase of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows.

This is enabled by Earth being an [[ocean world]], the only one in the [[Solar System]] sustaining liquid [[surface water]]. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering [[Water distribution on Earth|70.8%]] of [[Earth's crust]]. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of [[continent]]al [[landmass]]es within Earth's [[land hemisphere]]. Most of Earth's land is somewhat [[humid]] and covered by vegetation, while large [[Ice sheet|sheets of ice]] at [[Earth's polar regions|Earth's polar]] [[desert]]s retain more water than Earth's [[groundwater]], lakes, rivers and [[Water vapor#In Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric water]] combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], which interact to produce mountain ranges, [[volcano]]es, and earthquakes. [[Earth's outer core|Earth has a liquid outer core]] that generates a [[magnetosphere]] capable of deflecting most of the destructive [[solar wind]]s and [[cosmic radiation]]. \\n\\nEarth has [[Atmosphere of Earth|a dynamic atmosphere]], which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most [[meteoroid]]s and [[Ozone layer|UV-light at entry]]. It has a composition of primarily [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. [[Water vapor]] is widely present in the atmosphere, [[Cloud#Formation|forming clouds]] that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a [[greenhouse gas]] and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of [[Solar irradiance|energy from the Sun's light]]. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of {{convert|14.76|C|F}}, at which water is liquid under normal atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the [[equatorial region]] receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive [[Atmospheric circulation|atmospheric]] and [[ocean current]]s, producing a global [[climate system]] with different [[climate region]]s, and a range of weather phenomena such as [[precipitation]], allowing components such as [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] to [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycle]].\\n\\nEarth is [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|rounded]] into [[Earth ellipsoid|an ellipsoid]] with [[Earth's circumference|a circumference]] of about 40,000&nbsp;km. It is the [[List of Solar System objects by size|densest planet in the Solar System]]. Of the four [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planets]], it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight [[light-minute]]s away from the Sun and [[Earth's orbit|orbits it]], taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|Earth's axis of rotation]] is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing [[season]]s. Earth is [[orbit]]ed by one [[Claimed moons of Earth|permanent]] [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], which [[orbit]]s Earth at 384,400&nbsp;km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon's gravity helps stabilize Earth's axis, causes [[tide]]s and [[Tidal acceleration|gradually slows Earth's rotation]]. [[Tidal locking]] has made the Moon always face Earth with the same side.\\n\\nEarth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, [[Age of Earth|formed 4.5&nbsp;billion years ago]] from gas and dust in the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|early Solar System]]. During the first billion years of [[History of Earth|Earth's history]], the ocean formed and then [[Abiogenesis|life developed]] within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the [[Great Oxidation Event]] two billion years ago. [[Human]]s emerged [[Human history|300,000 years ago]] in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth. Humans depend on Earth's [[biosphere]] and natural resources for their survival, but have [[Human impact on the environment|increasingly impacted the planet's environment]]. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is [[Sustainability|unsustainable]], threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and [[Holocene extinction|causing widespread extinctions]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=What Is Climate Change? |url=https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change |access-date=17 August 2022 |website=United Nations |language=en |archive-date=26 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230126173023/https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe [[Modern English]] word {{anchor|Name|Etymology}} ''Earth'' developed, via [[Middle English]], from an [[Old English]] noun most often spelled ''{{linktext|eor\\u00f0e}}''.<ref name=\\\"oedearth\\\">{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=3|chapter=earth, ''n.\\u00b9''|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|place=[[Oxford, England|Oxford]], England|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199571123.001.0001}}</ref> It has cognates in every [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], and their [[proto-Germanic|ancestral root]] has been reconstructed as [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/er\\u00fe\\u014d|*''er\\u00fe\\u014d'']].

Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.<ref name=\\\"earth_fact_sheet\\\" /><ref name=\\\"moon_fact_sheet\\\" />\\n\\nThe [[Hill sphere]], or the [[Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of gravitational influence]], of Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.<ref name=\\\"vazquez_etal2006\\\" /><ref group=\\\"n\\\" name=\\\"hill_radius\\\" /> This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than that of the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.<ref name=\\\"vazquez_etal2006\\\" /> Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].<ref name=\\\"nasa20051201\\\" />\\n\\n=== Axial tilt and seasons ===\\n{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}\\n[[File:axial tilt vs tropical and polar circles.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Earth's axial tilt causing different angles of seasonal illumination at different orbital positions around the Sun]]\\nThe axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281\\u00b0<ref name=\\\"IERS\\\" /> with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere.\\n\\nDuring the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rohli|first1=Robert.

In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.<ref name=\\\"bromberg2008\\\" />\\n\\nThe angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&nbsp;years.<ref name=\\\"lin2006\\\" /> The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[axial precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.<ref name=\\\"fisher19960205\\\" />\\n\\nEarth's annual orbit is elliptical rather than circular, and its closest approach to the Sun is called [[perihelion]]. In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates shift over time due to precession and changes to the orbit, the latter of which follows cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The annual change in the Earth\\u2013Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/|title=Milankovitch (Orbital) Cycles and Their Role in Earth's Climate|work=NASA|last1=Buis|first1=Alan|date=27 February 2020|access-date=27 October 2020|archive-date=30 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030105553/https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref group=\\\"n\\\" name=\\\"solar_energy\\\" /> Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/pub/seager/Kang_Seager_subm.pdf|title=Croll Revisited: Why is the Northern Hemisphere Warmer than the Southern Hemisphere?|work=Columbia University|last1=Kang|first1=Sarah M.|last2=Seager|first2=Richard|location=New York|access-date=27 October 2020|archive-date=7 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210907195739/http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/pub/seager/Kang_Seager_subm.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n== Earth\\u2013Moon system ==\\n{{Further||Satellite system (astronomy)}}\\n\\n=== Moon ===\\n{{Main|Moon|Lunar theory|Orbit of the Moon}}\\n[[File:MarsReconnaissanceOrbiter-Views-EarthMoon-20220422.jpg|thumb|Earth and the Moon as seen from [[Mars]] by the ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'']]\\n[[File:Earthrise over Compton crater -LRO full res - edit1.jpg|thumb|View of Earth from the Moon by the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]]]]\\n\\nThe Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], [[Planetary-mass moon|planet-like natural satellite]], with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's.

This also set up a process of urbanization as people of all classes were free to move jobs so people went to the city for better work. It remained influential, though less for governing than inspiring, throughout the [[Meiji era]] and into the twentieth century, and it can be considered the first [[constitution]] of modern Japan.<ref>Keene, p. 340, notes that one might \\\"describe the Oath in Five Articles as a constitution for all ages. Japan was modernized due to the Charter Oath.\\\"</ref>\\n\\n==Rules==\\nAs the name implies, the text of the Oath consists of five clauses:\\n\\n{{quotation|By this oath, we set up as our aim the establishment of the national wealth on a broad basis and the framing of a constitution and laws.\\n\\n# Deliberative assemblies shall be widely established and all matters decided by open discussion.\\n# All classes, high and low, shall be united in vigorously carrying out the administration of affairs of state.\\n# The common people, no less than the civil and military officials, shall all be allowed to pursue their own calling so that there may be no discontent.\\n# Evil customs of the past shall be broken off  and everything based upon the just laws of Nature.\\n# Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundation of imperial rule.<ref>McLaren, p. 8, quoted in De Bary ''et al.'', p. 672.</ref>}}\\n\\n==Origin and subsequent influence==\\nThe first draft of the Oath was written by junior councilor [[Yuri Kimimasa]] in January 1868, containing progressive language that spoke to the frustrations that the radical but modestly born Meiji leaders had experienced in \\\"service to hereditary incompetents.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Jansen 2002, p. 338\\\">Jansen (2002), p. 338.</ref> Yuri's language was moderated by his colleague [[Fukuoka Takachika]] in February to be \\\"less alarming,\\\" and [[Kido Takayoshi]] prepared the final form of the Oath, employing \\\"language broad enough to embrace both readings.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Jansen 2002, p. 338\\\"/> The Oath was read aloud by [[Sanj\\u014d Sanetomi]] in the main ceremonial hall of the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] in the presence of the Emperor and more than 400 officials. After the reading, the [[kuge|nobles]] and ''[[daimy\\u014d]]s'' present signed their names to a document praising the Oath, and swearing to do their utmost to uphold and implement it. Those not able to attend the formal reading afterwards visited the palace to sign their names, bringing the total number of signatures to 767.<ref>Keene, Meiji and His World, page 140</ref>\\n\\nThe purpose of the oath was both to issue a statement of policy to be followed by the post-[[Tokugawa shogunate]] government in the Meiji period, and to offer hope of inclusion in the next regime to pro-Tokugawa domains. This second motivation was especially important in the early stages of the [[Meiji Restoration|Restoration]] as a means to keep domains from joining the Tokugawa remnant in the [[Boshin War]]. Later, military victory \\\"made it safe to begin to push court nobles and ''daimy\\u014d'' figureheads out of the way\\\".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>Jansen (2002), 342.</ref>\\n\\nThe promise of reform in the document initially went unfulfilled: in particular, a parliament with real power was not established until 1890, and the [[Meiji oligarchy]] from [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]], [[Ch\\u014dsh\\u016b Domain|Ch\\u014dsh\\u016b]], [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]] and [[Hizen Domain|Hizen]] retained political and military control well into the 20th century. In general, the Oath was purposely phrased in broad terms to minimize resistance from the ''daimy\\u014ds'' and to provide \\\"a promise of gradualism and equity\\\":{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>Jansen (2002), p. 339</ref>\\n\\n{{quotation|\\\"Deliberative councils\\\" and \\\"public discourse\\\" were, after all, terms that had been applied to cooperation between lords of great domains. That \\\"all classes\\\" were to unite indicated that there would continue to be classes. Even \\\"commoners\\\" were to be treated decently by \\\"civil and military\\\" officers, the privileged ranks of the recent past. No one was likely to be in favor of the retention of \\\"evil customs\\\"; a rather Confucian \\\"Nature\\\" would indicate the path to be chosen.

There are different camping areas, each with its own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only [[campsite]]. An accessible campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. [[Tipi]]s have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired [[yurt]] sauna.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/accommodation/tipis |title=Tipis |publisher=Glastonbury Festival |access-date=31 October 2012 |archive-date=10 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110040926/http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/accommodation/tipis |url-status=live}}</ref>\\n\\n[[Campervan]]s, [[travel trailer|caravans]] and [[Popup camper|trailer tents]] are not allowed into the main festival site. However, the purchase of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows.

On the second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the [[South Pole]] on 17 January 1912, less than five weeks after [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition]]. A planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed, despite Scott's written instructions, and at a distance of {{convert|162|mi|km}} from their base camp at [[Hut Point]] and approximately {{convert|12.5|mi|km}} from the next depot, Scott and his companions died. When Scott and his party's bodies were discovered, they had in their possession the first Antarctic [[fossil]]s discovered.<ref name=\\\":0\\\">{{Cite web|url=http://expeditions.fieldmuseum.org/antarctic-dinosaurs/antarctic-fossils|title=Antarctic Fossils {{!}} Expeditions|website=expeditions.fieldmuseum.org|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref> The fossils were determined to be from the ''[[Glossopteris]]'' tree and proved that Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15384729 |title=Four things Captain Scott found in Antarctica|publisher= BBC|access-date= 11 October 2014}}</ref>\\n\\nBefore his appointment to lead the ''Discovery'' expedition, Scott had a career as a Royal Navy officer. In 1899, he had a chance encounter with Sir [[Clements Markham]], the president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=82}} His name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life.\\n\\nFollowing the news of his death, Scott became a celebrated hero, a status reflected by memorials erected across the UK. However, in the last decades of the 20th century, questions were raised about his competence and character. Commentators in the 21st century have regarded Scott more positively after assessing the temperature drop below {{convert|-40|C}} in March 1912, and after re-discovering Scott's written orders of October 1911, in which he had instructed the dog teams to meet and assist him on the return trip.{{sfn|May|2013}}\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n=== Family ===\\n[[File:Robert Falcon Scott aged 13.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Scott as a naval cadet, 1882]]\\nScott was born on 6 June 1868, the third of six children and elder son of John Edward, a brewer and magistrate, and Hannah (n\\u00e9e Cuming) Scott of [[Stoke Damerel]], near [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]]. There were also naval and military traditions in the family, Scott's grandfather and four uncles all having served in the army or navy.{{sfn|Crane|2005|pp=14\\u201315}} John Scott's prosperity came from the ownership of a small [[Plymouth]] brewery which he had inherited from his father and subsequently sold.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=22}} Scott's early childhood years were spent in comfort, but some years later, when he was establishing his naval career, the family suffered serious financial misfortune.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/race-to-the-end-of-the-earth/scott-s-expedition |title=Scott's Expedition|website= American Museum of Natural History|access-date= 15 June 2014}}</ref>\\n\\nIn accordance with the family's tradition, Scott and his younger brother Archie were predestined for careers in the armed services. Scott spent four years at a local day school before being sent to [[Stubbington House School]] in Hampshire, a [[cram school|cramming establishment]] that prepared candidates for the entrance examinations to the naval training ship {{HMS|Britannia|1869|6}} at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]. Having passed these exams Scott began his naval career in 1881, as a 13-year-old cadet.{{sfn|Fiennes|2003|p=17}}\\n\\n=== Early naval career ===\\nIn July 1883, Scott passed out of ''Britannia'' as a midshipman, seventh overall in a class of 26.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=23}} By October, he was en route to South Africa to join {{HMS|Boadicea|1875|6}}, the flagship of the Cape squadron, the first of several ships on which he served during his midshipman years. While stationed in [[St Kitts]], [[West Indies]], on {{HMS|Rover|1874|6}}, he had his first encounter with [[Clements Markham]], then Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, who would loom large in Scott's later career. On this occasion, 1 March 1887, Markham observed Midshipman Scott's cutter winning that morning's race across the bay. Markham's habit was to \\\"collect\\\" likely young naval officers with a view to their undertaking polar exploration work in the future. He was impressed by Scott's intelligence, enthusiasm and charm, and the 18-year-old midshipman was duly noted.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=82}}\\n\\nIn March 1888 Scott passed his examinations for sub-lieutenant, with four first class certificates out of five.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=34}} His career progressed smoothly, with service on various ships and promotion to lieutenant in 1889. In 1891, after a long spell in foreign waters, he applied for the two-year torpedo training course on {{HMS|Vernon|shore establishment|6}}, an important career step. He graduated with first class certificates in both the theory and practical examinations. A small blot occurred in the summer of 1893 when, while commanding a torpedo boat, Scott ran it aground, a mishap which earned him a mild rebuke.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=50}}\\n\\nDuring the research for his dual biography of Scott and Roald Amundsen, polar historian [[Roland Huntford]] investigated a possible scandal in Scott's early naval career, related to the period 1889\\u20131890 when Scott was a lieutenant on {{HMS|Amphion|1883|6}}. According to Huntford, Scott \\\"disappears from naval records\\\" for eight months, from mid-August 1889 until 26 March 1890. Huntford hints at involvement with a married American woman, a cover-up, and protection by senior officers. Biographer David Crane reduces the missing period to eleven weeks, but is unable to clarify further. He rejects the notion of protection by senior officers on the grounds that Scott was not important or well-connected enough to warrant this. Documents that may have offered explanations are missing from Admiralty records.{{sfn|Huntford|1985|pp=121\\u2013123}}{{sfn|Crane|2005|pp=39\\u201340}}\\n[[File:Robert Falcon Scott c1900.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Scott by [[John Thomson (photographer)|John Thomson]], c. 1900]]\\nIn 1894, while serving as torpedo officer on the depot ship {{HMS|Vulcan|1889|6}}, Scott learned of the financial calamity that had overtaken his family. John Scott, having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely, had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt.{{sfn|Fiennes|2003|p=21}} At the age of 63, and in poor health, he was forced to take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to [[Shepton Mallet]], Somerset. Three years later, while Robert was serving with the [[Channel Fleet|Channel Squadron]] flagship {{HMS|Majestic|1895|6}}, John Scott died of heart disease, creating a fresh family crisis.{{sfn|Fiennes|2003|p=22}} Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters now relied entirely on the service pay of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie, who had left the army for a higher-paid post in the colonial service. Archie's own death in the autumn of 1898, after contracting [[typhoid fever]], meant that the whole financial responsibility for the family rested on Scott.{{sfn|Fiennes|2003|p=23}}\\n\\nPromotion, and the extra income this would bring, now became a matter of considerable concern to Scott.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=59}} In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, he had a chance encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with {{RRS|Discovery||2}}, under the auspices of the RGS. It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself, rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=84}} What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=82}}\\n\\n== ''Discovery'' expedition, 1901\\u20131904 ==\\n{{main|Discovery Expedition}}\\n[[File:ATLNZ 11714.jpeg|thumb|[[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]], Scott, and [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Wilson]] before their march south during the [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' expedition]], 2 November 1902]]\\nThe British National Antarctic Expedition, later known as the ''Discovery'' Expedition, was a joint enterprise of the RGS and the [[Royal Society]]. A long-cherished dream of Markham's, it required all of his skills and cunning to bring the expedition to fruition, under naval command and largely staffed by naval personnel. Scott may not have been Markham's first choice as leader but, having decided on him, the older man remained a constant supporter.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=90}} There were committee battles over the scope of Scott's responsibilities, with the Royal Society pressing to put a scientist in charge of the expedition's programme while Scott merely commanded the ship.

Afterwards, his followers, a set of [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] Jews, proclaimed him risen from the dead. Christianity began as [[Jewish Christianity|a Jewish sect]] and remained so for centuries in some locations, [[Split of Christianity and Judaism|diverging gradually from Judaism]] over doctrinal, social and historical differences. In spite of persecution in the Roman Empire, the faith spread as a [[grassroots]] movement that became established by the third-century both in and outside the empire. [[New Testament]] texts were written and church government was loosely organized in its first centuries, though the [[Biblical_canon#Christian_canons|biblical canon]] did not become official until 382. \\n\\nThe Roman Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] became the first Christian emperor in 313. He issued the [[Edict of Milan]] expressing tolerance for all religions thereby legalizing Christian worship. He did not make Christianity the state religion, but did provide crucial support. Constantine called the first of [[seven ecumenical councils]] needed to resolve disagreements over defining Jesus' divinity. Eastern and Western Christianity were already diverging by the fourth-century. [[Byzantium]] was more prosperous than the west, and what became [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] was more influential, organized and united with the state than Christianity in the west into the [[Middle Ages]]. During the [[High Middle Ages]], Eastern and [[Western Christianity]] had grown far enough apart that differences led to the [[East\\u2013West Schism]] of 1054. Temporary reunion was not achieved until the year before the fall of Constantinople. Both [[Islam]] and [[Crusades|western crusading]] negatively impacted Eastern Christianity, and the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquering of Constantinople in 1453]] put an end to the institutional church as established under Constantine, though it survived in altered form.\\n\\nIn the [[Early Middle Ages]], [[Missionary|missionary]] activities spread Christianity west and north. Monks and nuns played a prominent role in establishing [[Christendom]] which influenced every aspect of medieval life. From the ninth-century into the twelfth, politicization and [[Christianization]] went hand-in-hand developing [[East Central Europe]] and [[Russia]]. Various catastrophic circumstances, combined with a growing [[Criticism of the Catholic Church|criticism]] of the [[Catholic Church]] church in the 1300\\u20131500s, led to the [[Protestant Reformation]] and its related [[Protestantism|reform movements]]. Reform and its Catholic counterpart, the [[counter-reformation]], were followed by the [[European wars of religion]], the development of modern concepts of tolerance, and the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christianity also influenced the [[New World]] through its connection to [[colonialism]], its part in the [[American Revolution]], the dissolution of slavery in the west, and the long-term impact of Protestant missions.\\n\\nIn the twenty-first century, traditional Christianity has declined in the West, while new forms have developed and expanded throughout the world.

In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the [[liver]], although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives bile, produced by the liver, via the [[common hepatic duct]], and stores it. The bile is then released via the [[common bile duct]] into the [[duodenum]], where the bile helps in the digestion of [[fat]]s.\\n\\nThe gallbladder can be affected by [[gallstone]]s, formed by material that cannot be dissolved \\u2013 usually [[cholesterol]] or [[bilirubin]], a product of [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder (called a [[cholecystectomy]]). [[Cholecystitis]], inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.\\n\\n==Structure==\\nThe gallbladder is a hollow grey-blue [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=1187-81}} In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately {{convert|7|to|10|cm|abbr=off}} in length and {{convert|4|cm|in}} in diameter when fully distended.<ref name=\\\"meilstrup\\\">{{cite book |author=Jon W.

On the second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the [[South Pole]] on 17 January 1912, less than five weeks after [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition]]. A planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed, despite Scott's written instructions, and at a distance of {{convert|162|mi|km}} from their base camp at [[Hut Point]] and approximately {{convert|12.5|mi|km}} from the next depot, Scott and his companions died. When Scott and his party's bodies were discovered, they had in their possession the first Antarctic [[fossil]]s discovered.<ref name=\\\":0\\\">{{Cite web|url=http://expeditions.fieldmuseum.org/antarctic-dinosaurs/antarctic-fossils|title=Antarctic Fossils {{!}} Expeditions|website=expeditions.fieldmuseum.org|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref> The fossils were determined to be from the ''[[Glossopteris]]'' tree and proved that Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15384729 |title=Four things Captain Scott found in Antarctica|publisher= BBC|access-date= 11 October 2014}}</ref>\\n\\nBefore his appointment to lead the ''Discovery'' expedition, Scott had a career as a Royal Navy officer. In 1899, he had a chance encounter with Sir [[Clements Markham]], the president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=82}} His name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life.\\n\\nFollowing the news of his death, Scott became a celebrated hero, a status reflected by memorials erected across the UK. However, in the last decades of the 20th century, questions were raised about his competence and character. Commentators in the 21st century have regarded Scott more positively after assessing the temperature drop below {{convert|-40|C}} in March 1912, and after re-discovering Scott's written orders of October 1911, in which he had instructed the dog teams to meet and assist him on the return trip.{{sfn|May|2013}}\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n=== Family ===\\n[[File:Robert Falcon Scott aged 13.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Scott as a naval cadet, 1882]]\\nScott was born on 6 June 1868, the third of six children and elder son of John Edward, a brewer and magistrate, and Hannah (n\\u00e9e Cuming) Scott of [[Stoke Damerel]], near [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]]. There were also naval and military traditions in the family, Scott's grandfather and four uncles all having served in the army or navy.{{sfn|Crane|2005|pp=14\\u201315}} John Scott's prosperity came from the ownership of a small [[Plymouth]] brewery which he had inherited from his father and subsequently sold.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=22}} Scott's early childhood years were spent in comfort, but some years later, when he was establishing his naval career, the family suffered serious financial misfortune.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/race-to-the-end-of-the-earth/scott-s-expedition |title=Scott's Expedition|website= American Museum of Natural History|access-date= 15 June 2014}}</ref>\\n\\nIn accordance with the family's tradition, Scott and his younger brother Archie were predestined for careers in the armed services. Scott spent four years at a local day school before being sent to [[Stubbington House School]] in Hampshire, a [[cram school|cramming establishment]] that prepared candidates for the entrance examinations to the naval training ship {{HMS|Britannia|1869|6}} at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]. Having passed these exams Scott began his naval career in 1881, as a 13-year-old cadet.{{sfn|Fiennes|2003|p=17}}\\n\\n=== Early naval career ===\\nIn July 1883, Scott passed out of ''Britannia'' as a midshipman, seventh overall in a class of 26.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=23}} By October, he was en route to South Africa to join {{HMS|Boadicea|1875|6}}, the flagship of the Cape squadron, the first of several ships on which he served during his midshipman years. While stationed in [[St Kitts]], [[West Indies]], on {{HMS|Rover|1874|6}}, he had his first encounter with [[Clements Markham]], then Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, who would loom large in Scott's later career. On this occasion, 1 March 1887, Markham observed Midshipman Scott's cutter winning that morning's race across the bay. Markham's habit was to \\\"collect\\\" likely young naval officers with a view to their undertaking polar exploration work in the future. He was impressed by Scott's intelligence, enthusiasm and charm, and the 18-year-old midshipman was duly noted.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=82}}\\n\\nIn March 1888 Scott passed his examinations for sub-lieutenant, with four first class certificates out of five.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=34}} His career progressed smoothly, with service on various ships and promotion to lieutenant in 1889. In 1891, after a long spell in foreign waters, he applied for the two-year torpedo training course on {{HMS|Vernon|shore establishment|6}}, an important career step. He graduated with first class certificates in both the theory and practical examinations. A small blot occurred in the summer of 1893 when, while commanding a torpedo boat, Scott ran it aground, a mishap which earned him a mild rebuke.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=50}}\\n\\nDuring the research for his dual biography of Scott and Roald Amundsen, polar historian [[Roland Huntford]] investigated a possible scandal in Scott's early naval career, related to the period 1889\\u20131890 when Scott was a lieutenant on {{HMS|Amphion|1883|6}}. According to Huntford, Scott \\\"disappears from naval records\\\" for eight months, from mid-August 1889 until 26 March 1890. Huntford hints at involvement with a married American woman, a cover-up, and protection by senior officers. Biographer David Crane reduces the missing period to eleven weeks, but is unable to clarify further. He rejects the notion of protection by senior officers on the grounds that Scott was not important or well-connected enough to warrant this. Documents that may have offered explanations are missing from Admiralty records.{{sfn|Huntford|1985|pp=121\\u2013123}}{{sfn|Crane|2005|pp=39\\u201340}}\\n[[File:Robert Falcon Scott c1900.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Scott by [[John Thomson (photographer)|John Thomson]], c. 1900]]\\nIn 1894, while serving as torpedo officer on the depot ship {{HMS|Vulcan|1889|6}}, Scott learned of the financial calamity that had overtaken his family. John Scott, having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely, had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt.{{sfn|Fiennes|2003|p=21}} At the age of 63, and in poor health, he was forced to take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to [[Shepton Mallet]], Somerset. Three years later, while Robert was serving with the [[Channel Fleet|Channel Squadron]] flagship {{HMS|Majestic|1895|6}}, John Scott died of heart disease, creating a fresh family crisis.{{sfn|Fiennes|2003|p=22}} Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters now relied entirely on the service pay of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie, who had left the army for a higher-paid post in the colonial service. Archie's own death in the autumn of 1898, after contracting [[typhoid fever]], meant that the whole financial responsibility for the family rested on Scott.{{sfn|Fiennes|2003|p=23}}\\n\\nPromotion, and the extra income this would bring, now became a matter of considerable concern to Scott.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=59}} In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, he had a chance encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with {{RRS|Discovery||2}}, under the auspices of the RGS. It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself, rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=84}} What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=82}}\\n\\n== ''Discovery'' expedition, 1901\\u20131904 ==\\n{{main|Discovery Expedition}}\\n[[File:ATLNZ 11714.jpeg|thumb|[[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]], Scott, and [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Wilson]] before their march south during the [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' expedition]], 2 November 1902]]\\nThe British National Antarctic Expedition, later known as the ''Discovery'' Expedition, was a joint enterprise of the RGS and the [[Royal Society]]. A long-cherished dream of Markham's, it required all of his skills and cunning to bring the expedition to fruition, under naval command and largely staffed by naval personnel. Scott may not have been Markham's first choice as leader but, having decided on him, the older man remained a constant supporter.{{sfn|Crane|2005|p=90}} There were committee battles over the scope of Scott's responsibilities, with the Royal Society pressing to put a scientist in charge of the expedition's programme while Scott merely commanded the ship.

Afterwards, his followers, a set of [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] Jews, proclaimed him risen from the dead. Christianity began as [[Jewish Christianity|a Jewish sect]] and remained so for centuries in some locations, [[Split of Christianity and Judaism|diverging gradually from Judaism]] over doctrinal, social and historical differences. In spite of persecution in the Roman Empire, the faith spread as a [[grassroots]] movement that became established by the third-century both in and outside the empire. [[New Testament]] texts were written and church government was loosely organized in its first centuries, though the [[Biblical_canon#Christian_canons|biblical canon]] did not become official until 382. \\n\\nThe Roman Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] became the first Christian emperor in 313. He issued the [[Edict of Milan]] expressing tolerance for all religions thereby legalizing Christian worship. He did not make Christianity the state religion, but did provide crucial support. Constantine called the first of [[seven ecumenical councils]] needed to resolve disagreements over defining Jesus' divinity. Eastern and Western Christianity were already diverging by the fourth-century. [[Byzantium]] was more prosperous than the west, and what became [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] was more influential, organized and united with the state than Christianity in the west into the [[Middle Ages]]. During the [[High Middle Ages]], Eastern and [[Western Christianity]] had grown far enough apart that differences led to the [[East\\u2013West Schism]] of 1054. Temporary reunion was not achieved until the year before the fall of Constantinople. Both [[Islam]] and [[Crusades|western crusading]] negatively impacted Eastern Christianity, and the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquering of Constantinople in 1453]] put an end to the institutional church as established under Constantine, though it survived in altered form.\\n\\nIn the [[Early Middle Ages]], [[Missionary|missionary]] activities spread Christianity west and north. Monks and nuns played a prominent role in establishing [[Christendom]] which influenced every aspect of medieval life. From the ninth-century into the twelfth, politicization and [[Christianization]] went hand-in-hand developing [[East Central Europe]] and [[Russia]]. Various catastrophic circumstances, combined with a growing [[Criticism of the Catholic Church|criticism]] of the [[Catholic Church]] church in the 1300\\u20131500s, led to the [[Protestant Reformation]] and its related [[Protestantism|reform movements]]. Reform and its Catholic counterpart, the [[counter-reformation]], were followed by the [[European wars of religion]], the development of modern concepts of tolerance, and the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christianity also influenced the [[New World]] through its connection to [[colonialism]], its part in the [[American Revolution]], the dissolution of slavery in the west, and the long-term impact of Protestant missions.\\n\\nIn the twenty-first century, traditional Christianity has declined in the West, while new forms have developed and expanded throughout the world.

In humans, the pear-shaped gallbladder lies beneath the [[liver]], although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. It receives bile, produced by the liver, via the [[common hepatic duct]], and stores it. The bile is then released via the [[common bile duct]] into the [[duodenum]], where the bile helps in the digestion of [[fat]]s.\\n\\nThe gallbladder can be affected by [[gallstone]]s, formed by material that cannot be dissolved \\u2013 usually [[cholesterol]] or [[bilirubin]], a product of [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. These may cause significant pain, particularly in the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder (called a [[cholecystectomy]]). [[Cholecystitis]], inflammation of the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.\\n\\n==Structure==\\nThe gallbladder is a hollow grey-blue [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] that sits in a shallow depression below the right lobe of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Gray's Anatomy|2008|p=1187-81}} In adults, the gallbladder measures approximately {{convert|7|to|10|cm|abbr=off}} in length and {{convert|4|cm|in}} in diameter when fully distended.<ref name=\\\"meilstrup\\\">{{cite book |author=Jon W.
