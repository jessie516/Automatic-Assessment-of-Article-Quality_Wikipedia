It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use [[3D computer graphics]] overlaid on [[Rendering (computer graphics)|pre-rendered]] static backgrounds. As with other [[LucasArts adventure games]], the player must converse with characters and examine, collect, and use objects to solve puzzles.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' is set in the Land of the Dead and the [[retro-futuristic]] version of the 1950s, through which recently departed souls, represented as ''[[calaca]]''-like figures, travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" [[Calavera]] as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the [[Aztec religion#Cosmology and ritual|Aztec afterlife]] with ''[[film noir]]'' style, with influences including ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.\\n\\n''Grim Fandango'' received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as [[List of video games considered the best|one of the greatest video games of all time]]. However, it was a [[List of commercial failures in video games|commercial failure]] and contributed towards LucasArts' decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre.\\n\\nIn 2014, with help from [[Sony]], Schafer's studio [[Double Fine Productions]] acquired the ''Grim Fandango'' license following [[Disney]]'s acquisition and closure of LucasArts as a video game developer the previous year. Double Fine produced a remastered version of the game, featuring improved character graphics, controls (including point and click), an orchestrated score, and directors' commentary. It was released for [[Linux]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita]], and Windows in January 2015, for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] in May 2015, for [[Nintendo Switch]] in November 2018, and for [[Xbox One]] in October 2020.\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\n''Grim Fandango'' is an [[adventure game]], in which the player controls Manuel \\\"Manny\\\" Calavera (''[[calavera]]'' being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the [[GrimE]] engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from [[3D model]]s, while the main objects and characters are animated in [[3D computer graphics|3D]].<ref name=\\\"bwire080997\\\" /> Additionally, cutscenes in the game have also been pre-rendered in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], a [[joystick]], or a [[gamepad]]. The remastered edition allows control via a [[computer mouse|mouse]] as well.

Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs and stay in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the [[Grim Reaper]] to escort the souls from the Land of the Living to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited.

Manny steals a client, Mercedes \\\"Meche\\\" Colomar, from his successful co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the \\\"Number Nine\\\" luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Manny''': Meche.

Don Copal uses it as a reason to arrest Manny. Manny was freed from arrest and sprouting by Salvador \\\"Sal\\\" Limones, the leader of the small underground organization the Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who warns him of Domino and Don rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Salvador''': I was once a reaper like yourself Manuel, but I uncovered a web of corruption in our beloved Department of Death.

Sal recruits Manny to help LSA by setting up a system of [[pigeon mail]] and providing the group with [[biometrics]] of Manny in order to access the computer systems of the Department. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to arrive.\\n\\n[[Image:Grim-fandango-cast.jpg|left|thumb|The cast of ''Grim Fandango''.

Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny sees Meche leaving the port with Domino, but when he tries to stop them, he himself was stopped by Meche. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda, the owner of the beatnik Blue Casket nightclub, that Don has been sprouted for letting the scandal be known.\\n\\nManny gives chase, manages to get on a board of leaving ship as a janitor, and a year later (after being promoted to a captain) tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Meche''': You were headed for a trap, I was trying to warn you.

Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and a few of the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.\\n\\nThe three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. The Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won't let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them, and it's further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or stolen Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train (which sends all souls on board to hell). Meanwhile, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a \\\"rocket\\\" train cart, quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis' life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grim Fandango |developer=LucasArts |year=1998 |quote='''Mechanics''': We shoot you now like an arrow into the wind.

Manny is able to defeat Hector after Sal sacrifices himself to prevent Olivia from interfering. \\n\\nManny and Meche are able to find the real Double N tickets, including the one that Meche should have received.

Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions.<ref name=\\\"psblog remake\\\"/> Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island#2009 rerelease|The Secret of Monkey Island]]''.<ref name=\\\"eg remastered retrospective\\\"/> Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from LucasArts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress.<ref name=\\\"polygon remastered\\\"/> When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and [[platform evangelism|developer relations]] [[Adam Boyes (entrepreneur)|Adam Boyes]], was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek ''Grim Fandango''{{'s}} after seeing developers like [[Capcom]] and [[Midway Games]] revive older properties.

A large number of backup files were made on [[Digital Linear Tape]] (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes.

As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/> In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.<ref name=\\\"kotaku remastered\\\"/>\\n\\nOnce original assets were identified, as to be used to present the \\\"classic\\\" look of the game in the Remastered edition, Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers.

Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an auto-save system, as well as the game not receiving a full high-definition upgrade, leaving the higher-resolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"gamespot rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"ign rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/> Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles, though a staple of the day when ''Grim Fandango'' was first released, remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them, and that a hint system, as was added to the ''Monkey Island'' remake, would have been very helpful.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/><ref name=\\\"pcgamer rm review 2015\\\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: it's worth admiring this lovingly restored antique |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Oliver |last=Cragg |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206185431/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/grim-fandango-remastered-review-its-worth-admiring-this-lovingly-restored-antique-10022521.html |archive-date=February 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/02/03/grim-fandango-remastered-review-a-witty-but-tedious-classic/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered review: A witty but tedious classic |first=Christopher |last=Byrd |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> The game's pacing, also unchanged from the original version, was also found harder to grasp, in both the pacing within the game's four acts, and the time taken to move around and between rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |title=Grim Fandango Remastered is a flawed remake of a considered masterpiece |website=Ars Technica |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=January 27, 2015 |first=Steven |last=Strom |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128021850/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered-is-a-flawed-remake-of-a-considered-masterpiece/ |archive-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref> In his review for [[Eurogamer]], Richard Cobbett warned players to \\\"be careful of rose-tinted memories\\\", that while the remastered version is faithful to the original, it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in video game development.<ref name=\\\"eurogamer rm review\\\"/> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'s}} Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was \\\"an artifact of its time, an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing\\\".<ref name=\\\"wired rm review\\\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered/ |title=I Love You, Grim Fandango, Even Though You're Broken |first=Laura |last=Hudson |date=January 29, 2015 |access-date=January 29, 2015 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201130938/http://www.wired.com/2015/01/grim-fandango-remastered |archive-date=February 1, 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n==Legacy==\\nIn 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]'' characterized the game as \\\"the last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer's noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead.

He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. One option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]].<ref>{{cite web

He was famous for his comic and character roles [[Stanley Holloway on stage and screen|on stage and screen]], especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. He was also renowned for his [[Songs and monologues of Stanley Holloway|comic monologues and songs]], which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.\\n\\nBorn in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in ''[[Kissing Time]]'' when the musical transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1921, he joined a [[Concert party (entertainment)|concert party]], ''[[The Co-Optimists]]'', and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by [[Marriott Edgar]], were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in [[variety show|variety]], [[pantomime]] and musical comedy, including several [[revue]]s.\\n\\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the [[British Film Institute]] and [[Path\\u00e9 News]] and took character parts in a series of films including ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'', ''[[The Way Ahead]]'', ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' and ''[[The Way to the Stars]]''. In the decade after the war, he appeared in the film ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' and ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]''.\\n\\nIn 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in ''My Fair Lady'', a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the [[My Fair Lady (film)|film version in 1964]]. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor [[Julian Holloway]].\\n\\n==Biography==\\n\\n===Family background and early life===\\nHolloway was born in [[Manor Park, London|Manor Park]], [[Essex]] (now in the [[London Borough of Newham]]), on 1 October 1890.

It is particularly associated with two families: the Beauforts, who held the title from the creation of 1448, and the Seymours, from the creation of 1547, in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique, in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Kingdom of England]], using a power granted in the will of his nephew [[King Edward VI]].\\n\\nThe only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is '''Baron Seymour''', which is used as a [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles, yet the holder's [[Order of precedence|precedence]] is higher than his title suggests, by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset (the only more senior non-royal duke is the [[Duke of Norfolk]]).\\n\\nSeveral other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset, but have become extinct. These include: [[Earl of Kendal]] (created 1443, extinct 1444), [[Earl of Somerset]] (created 1397, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Dorset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399; created 1442, forfeit 1461), [[Marquess of Somerset]] (created 1397, degraded 1399), [[Earl of Dorset]] (created 1441, forfeit 1461), ''Viscount Rochester'' (created 1611, extinct 1645), ''Viscount Beauchamp of Hache'' (created 1536, forfeit 1552), [[Earl of Hertford]] (created 1537, forfeit 1552; and created 1559, extinct 1750), [[Marquess of Hertford]] (created 1640, extinct 1675), [[Baron Seymour of Trowbridge]] (created 1641, extinct 1750), [[Baron Percy]] (created 1722, separated 1750), ''[[Baron Cockermouth]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), ''[[Earl of Egremont]]'' (created 1749, separated 1750), and ''Earl St. Maur'' (created 1863, extinct 1885).\\n\\nThe ducal seat is [[Bradley House (Wiltshire)|Bradley House]] in [[Maiden Bradley]], west [[Wiltshire]], with a secondary estate at [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]], [[Totnes]], [[Devon]]. The principal burial place for the Seymour family today is [[All Saints' Church, Maiden Bradley]], adjacent to Bradley House; the church and the family cemetery can be reached from the grounds of Bradley House via private access.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/maidenbradley/maiden-bradley-times/duke-s-grave The grave of Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset], 19 July 2013</ref>\\n\\n==Creation of Empress Matilda==\\n[[William de Mohun of Dunster]] (?\\u2013c. 1155), a favourite of [[Empress Matilda]] and a loyal supporter of her in the war against [[Stephen I of England|King Stephen]] (during which he earned the epithet of the \\\"Scourge of the West\\\"), was given the title Earl of Somerset in 1141.

The patent of the dukedom specified that it was to descend to his issue by his second wife Anne Stanhope, thus excluding his eldest son by his first wife from the title, except in case of the failure of male heirs from the junior line. In 1547 he bought [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon from Sir Thomas Pomeroy,  although he probably never visited it, and it became the seat of his eldest son from his first marriage, Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593), whose son was made a [[Seymour baronets|baronet \\\"of Berry Pomeroy\\\"]].

She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch (1711\\u20131773), daughter of [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham]]. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748, at [[Petworth House]], [[Sussex]]<ref name=\\\"6th\\\"/> at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Seymour]] (1684\\u20131750).\\n\\n;Later subsidiary titles\\nAlgernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749, the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Hugh Smithson]], husband of Algernon's daughter Elizabeth Seymour (bef. 1730\\u20131776), whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister, Lady Catherine Seymour (1693\\u20131731). Without male issue, on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford, the barony of Beauchamp, and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct; and the dukedom of Somerset, together with the barony of Seymour, devolved on his distant cousin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://familytrees.genopro.com/ralphballard/default.htm?page=BaronPercy7thDukeOfSomers-Algernon-ind00244.htm | title=Algernon Baron Percy, 7th Duke of Somerset, Earl of Northumberland | publisher=Moore, Simpson, Ballard Family Tree \\u2013 England and Scotland to Australia | access-date=27 December 2010}}</ref>\\n\\n;Later descent\\nSir [[Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy]] (1694\\u20131757) became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750. The 1st baronet was (Sir) Edward Seymour (1556\\u20131613), son of Edward Seymour (1527/1535\\u20131593) who was the 1st Duke's eldest son and of Catherine Seymour (n\\u00e9e Filliol). He was a seventh-generation descendant of the 1st Duke. The 4th Baronet had been speaker of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and he moved the family home from [[Berry Pomeroy Castle]] in Devon to Bradley House in [[Maiden Bradley]].<ref>Report and Transactions of The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and the Arts. Vol 133 (2001), p 11-12.</ref>\\n\\nUpon this Duke's death he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward Seymour, 9th Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]] (1717\\u20131792). He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother [[Webb Seymour, 10th Duke of Somerset|Webb Seymour]] (1718\\u20131793) who became the 10th Duke. His son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 11th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1775\\u20131855) was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his father's death. He changed the family name to St. Maur, but Seymour was still very often used.\\n\\n==12th Duke and sons, the Earls St. Maur==\\n[[Image:12th Duke of Somerset.png|thumb|Edward Seymour]]\\nThe 11th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward Adolphus Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset|Edward Adolphus Seymour]] (1804\\u20131885) who was created Earl St. Maur, [[territorial designation|of Berry Pomeroy]] in 1863. His eldest son who predeceased him [[Edward Adolphus Ferdinand Seymour, Earl St. Maur|Edward A. F. Seymour]] (1835\\u20131869) was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted ''Earl St. Maur''. Commonly known as Ferdy, he was an adventurer who joined [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17-year-old maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels, returning to England with her in 1868 to live near [[Brighton]]. Ferdy and Rosina had two children; a girl named [[Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck|Ruth]] (1867\\u20131953) was born whilst the couple were in [[Tangier]] and a boy named Richard 'Harold' St. Maur (1869\\u20131927) was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl [[illegitimate children|married Rosina]], Harold would have been the heir to his grandfather's dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands, offering reward of \\u00a350 (equal to about \\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50|1885|r=-3}}}} today){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} for evidence to support the claim, but was unsuccessful.\\n\\n==13th\\u201319th dukes==\\nThe 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother [[Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour, 13th Duke of Somerset|Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour]] (1810\\u20131891). When he died a few years later, the youngest brother [[Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur, 14th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur]] (1813\\u20131894) became the 14th Duke.<ref>Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, ed.

His son [[Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset|Algernon Seymour]] (1846\\u20131923) became the 15th Duke.\\n\\nHe died without children and the title passed to his distant cousin [[Edward Hamilton Seymour, 16th Duke of Somerset|Edward Hamilton Seymour]] (1860\\u20131931), great-great-grandson of [[Lord Francis Seymour]], [[Dean of Wells]] (1726\\u20131799), youngest son of the 8th Duke. He was succeeded by his son [[Evelyn Francis Seymour, 17th Duke of Somerset|Evelyn Francis Seymour]] (1882\\u20131954) who passed the title on to his son [[Percy Hamilton Seymour, 18th Duke of Somerset|Percy Hamilton Seymour]] (1910\\u20131984). The title is currently held by his son [[John Michael Edward Seymour, 19th Duke of Somerset|John Michael Edward Seymour]] who was born in 1952.
