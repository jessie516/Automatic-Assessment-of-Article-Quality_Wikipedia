Born in Guangzhou into a Chinese family, Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the garden villas at Suzhou, the traditional retreat of the scholar-gentry to which his family belonged. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's architecture school, but quickly transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Unhappy with the focus on Beaux-Arts architecture at both schools, he spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially Le Corbusier.\\nAfter graduating, he joined the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) and befriended the Bauhaus architects Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. In 1948, Pei was recruited by New York City real estate magnate William Zeckendorf, for whom he worked for seven years before establishing an independent design firm, I. M. Pei & Associates, in 1955. In 1966, that became I. M. Pei & Partners, and  became Pei Cobb Freed & Partners in 1989. Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990. In his retirement, he worked as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons' architectural firm Pei Partnership Architects.\\nPei's first major recognition came with the Mesa Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the John F. Kennedy Library in Massachusetts. He went on to design Dallas City Hall and the East Building of the National Gallery of Art. He returned to China for the first time in 1975 to design a hotel at Fragrant Hills and, fifteen years later, designed Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong. In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy when he designed a glass-and-steel pyramid for the Louvre in Paris. He designed the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, the Miho Museum in Japan, Shigaraki, near Kyoto, and the chapel of the junior and high school: MIHO Institute of Aesthetics, the Suzhou Museum in Suzhou, Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar, and the Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art in Luxembourg.\\nPei won prizes and awards in the field of architecture, including the AIA Gold Medal in 1979, the first Praemium Imperiale for Architecture in 1989, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in 2003. In 1983, he won the Pritzker Prize, which is sometimes referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.\\n\\n\\n== Childhood ==\\n\\nI. M. Pei's ancestry traces back to the Ming dynasty, when his family moved from Anhui to Suzhou. The family made their wealth in medicinal herbs, then joined the ranks of the scholar-gentry. Pei Ieoh Ming was born on April 26, 1917, to Tsuyee and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to Hong Kong one year later. It eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist, who was recognized for her skills as a flautist. She invited him, but not his brothers or sisters, to join her on meditation retreats. His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.\\nPei's ancestors' success meant that the family lived in the upper echelons of society, but Pei said his father was \\\"not cultivated in the ways of the arts\\\". The younger Pei, drawn more to music and other cultural forms than to his father's domain of banking, explored art on his own. \\\"I have cultivated myself,\\\" he said later.\\nPei studied in St. Paul's College in Hong Kong as a child. When Pei was 10, his father received a promotion and relocated with his family to Shanghai. Pei attended St. John's Middle School, the secondary school of St. John's University that was run by Anglican missionaries. Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing billiards and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. He also learned rudimentary English by reading the Bible and novels by Charles Dickens.\\n\\nShanghai's many international elements gave it the name \\\"Paris of the East\\\". The city's global architectural flavors had a profound influence on Pei, from The Bund waterfront area to the Park Hotel, built in 1934. He was also impressed by the many gardens of Suzhou, where he spent the summers with extended family and regularly visited a nearby ancestral shrine. The Shizilin Garden, built in the 14th century by a Buddhist monk and owned by Pei's uncle Bei Runsheng, was especially influential. He spoke later of his fondness for the garden's blending of natural and human-built structures.\\nSoon after the move to Shanghai, Pei's mother developed cancer. She was prescribed opium for pain and assigned the task of preparing her pipe to Pei. She died shortly after his thirteenth birthday, and he was profoundly upset. The children were sent to live with extended family, as their father became more consumed by his work. Pei said: \\\"My father began living his own separate life pretty soon after that.\\\"  His father later married a woman named Aileen, who moved to New York later in her life.\\n\\n\\n== Education and formative years ==\\nAs Pei neared the end of his secondary education, he decided to attend university. He was accepted by a number of schools, but enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of Bing Crosby, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. \\\"College life in the U.S. seemed to me to be mostly fun and games\\\", he said in 2000. \\\"Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it ... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me.\\\" Pei added that \\\"Crosby's films in particular had a tremendous influence on my choosing the United States instead of England to pursue my education.\\\"\\nIn 1935, Pei boarded a boat and sailed to San Francisco, then traveled by train to Philadelphia. What he found once he arrived differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the Beaux-Arts style, rooted in the classical traditions of ancient Greece and Rome. Pei was more intrigued by modern architecture, and also felt intimidated by the high level of drafting proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.\\nMIT's architecture faculty was also focused on the Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work. In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. Pei was inspired by the innovative designs of the new International Style, characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in November 1935, an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: \\\"The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education.\\\" Pei was also influenced by the work of U.S. architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1938 he drove to Spring Green, Wisconsin, to visit Wright's famous Taliesin building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.\\nAlthough he disliked the Beaux-Arts emphasis, Pei excelled in his studies. \\\"I certainly don't regret the time at MIT\\\", he said later. \\\"There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture.\\\" Pei received his BArch degree in 1940; his thesis was titled \\\"Standardized Propaganda Units for War Time and Peace Time China\\\".\\nWhile visiting New York City in the late 1930s, Pei met a Wellesley College student named Eileen Loo. They began dating and married in the spring of 1942. She enrolled in the landscape architecture program at Harvard University, and Pei was thus introduced to members of the faculty at Harvard's Graduate School of Design (GSD). He was excited by the lively atmosphere and joined the GSD in December 1942.\\nLess than a month later, Pei suspended his work at Harvard to join the National Defense Research Committee, which coordinated scientific research into U.S. weapons technology during World War II. Pei's background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: \\\"If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy.\\\" The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the Pacific War. The U.S. realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on incendiary bombs. Pei spent two and a half years with the NDRC, but revealed few details of his work.\\nIn 1945, Eileen gave birth to a son, T'ing Chung, and she withdrew from the landscape architecture program in order to care for him. Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design. The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy. At the center were members of the Bauhaus, a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design. The Nazi regime had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of them, Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.\\nOne of Pei's design projects at the GSD was a plan for an art museum in Shanghai. He wanted to create a mood of Chinese authenticity in the architecture without using traditional materials or styles. The design was based on straight modernist structures, organized around a central courtyard garden, with other similar natural settings arranged nearby. It was very well received, with Gropius calling it \\\"the best thing done in [my] master class.\\\" Pei received his MArch degree in 1946, and taught at Harvard for another two years.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1948\\u20131956: early career with Webb and Knapp ===\\nIn the spring of 1948, Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate William Zeckendorf to join a staff of architects for his firm of Webb and Knapp to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.\\nHis first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building, which received funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation, and the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never progressed beyond the model stage.\\n\\nPei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949, when he designed a two-story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front fa\\u00e7ade was retained as part of an apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior curtain wall brought praise from the journal Architectural Forum. Pei's designs echoed the work of Mies van der Rohe in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah, New York in 1952. Soon, Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including Henry N. Cobb and Ulrich Franzen. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall on Long Island. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.\\n\\nIn 1952, Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in Denver, Colorado. The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than 25 percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas. One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography: \\\"I learned the process of development, and about the city as a living organism.\\\" These lessons, he said, became essential for later projects.\\nPei and his team also designed a united urban area for Washington, D.C., called L'Enfant Plaza (named for French-American architect Pierre Charles L'Enfant). Pei's associate Araldo Cossutta was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building and South Building. Vlastimil Koubek was the architect for the East Building (L'Enfant Plaza Hotel), and for the Center Building (now the United States Postal Service headquarters). The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both The Washington Post and Washington Star (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale.\\nIn 1955, Pei's group took a step toward institutional independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I. M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I. M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area on the East Side of Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of cement to check for consistency of color.\\nThe company continued its urban focus with the Society Hill project in central Philadelphia. Pei designed the Society Hill Towers, a three-building residential block injecting cubist design into the local 18th-century milieu. As with previous projects, abundant green spaces were central to Pei's vision, which added traditional townhouses to aid the transition from classical to modern design.\\n\\nFrom 1958 to 1963, Pei and Ray Affleck developed a key downtown block of Montreal in a phased process that involved one of Pei's most admired structures in the Commonwealth, the cruciform tower known as the Royal Bank Plaza (Place Ville Marie). According to The Canadian Encyclopedia : its grand plaza and lower office buildings, designed by internationally famous US architect I. M. Pei, helped to set new standards for architecture in Canada in the 1960s ... The tower's smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate Pei's adherence to the mainstream of 20th-century modern design.\\nAlthough those projects were satisfying, Pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself. In 1959, he was approached by MIT to design a building for its Earth science program. The Green Building continued the grid design of Kips Bay and Society Hill. The pedestrian walkway on the ground floor, however, was prone to sudden gusts of wind, which embarrassed Pei. \\\"Here I was from MIT,\\\" he said, \\\"and I didn't know about wind-tunnel effects.\\\" At the same time, he co-designed the Luce Memorial Chapel at Tunghai University in Taichung, Taiwan. The soaring structure, commissioned by the same organization that had run his middle school in Shanghai, broke severely from the cubist grid patterns of his urban projects.\\nThe challenge of coordinating those projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising the plans for them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. \\\"Design is something you have to put your hand to,\\\" he said. \\\"While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, I had to keep track of the whole enterprise.\\\" Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I. M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.\\n\\n\\n=== NCAR and related projects ===\\n\\nPei was able to return to hands-on design when he was approached in 1961 by Walter Orr Roberts to design the new Mesa Laboratory for the National Center for Atmospheric Research outside Boulder, Colorado. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work because it rested in an open area in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. He drove around the region with his wife, visiting assorted buildings and surveying the natural environs. He was impressed by the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, but felt it was \\\"detached from nature\\\".\\nThe conceptualization stages were important for Pei, presenting a need and an opportunity to break from the Bauhaus tradition. He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: \\\"I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy\\u2014the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again\\u2014just as my mother had taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me.\\\" Pei also drew inspiration from the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings of the Ancestral Puebloans; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings. To this end, he called for a rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.\\nRoberts disliked Pei's initial designs, referring to them as \\\"just a bunch of towers\\\". Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique, but Pei was frustrated. His second attempt, however, fitted Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels. The complex used many elements of cubist design, and the walkways were arranged to increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues.\\n\\nOnce the laboratory was built, several problems with its construction became apparent. Leaks in the roof caused difficulties for researchers, and the shifting of clay soil beneath the building caused cracks which were expensive to repair. Still, both architect and project manager were pleased with the final result. Pei referred to the NCAR complex as his \\\"breakout building\\\", and he remained a friend of Roberts until the scientist died in March 1990.\\nThe success of NCAR brought renewed attention to Pei's design acumen. He was recruited to work on a variety of projects, including the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York, the Sundrome terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, and dormitories at New College of Florida.\\n\\n\\n=== Kennedy Library ===\\n\\nAfter President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, his family and friends discussed constructing a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. \\\"He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,\\\" she said. \\\"He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.\\\" Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it \\\"really an emotional decision\\\", she explained: \\\"He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.\\\"\\nThe project was plagued with problems from the outset. President Kennedy had begun considering the structure of his library soon after taking office, and he wanted to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.\\nPei's first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant to represent the optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the United States. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the first proposed site for the building, as soon as the project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-1970s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. \\\"I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door at the end of the day,\\\" she said. \\\"His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I. M. to see that so many people didn't want the building.\\\"\\nFinally the project moved to Columbia Point, near the University of Massachusetts Boston. The new site was less than ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's architectural team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.\\nThe John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum was dedicated on October 20, 1979. Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. \\\"I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,\\\" he said in 2000. \\\"It could and should have been a great project.\\\" Pei's work on the Kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note.\\n\\n\\n=== \\\"Pei Plan\\\" in Oklahoma City ===\\n\\nThe Pei Plan was a failed urban redevelopment initiative designed for downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1964. The plan called for the demolition of hundreds of old downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens. It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s. The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development. Significant public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures. As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS) initiative in 1993.\\n\\n\\n=== Providence's Cathedral Square ===\\n\\nAnother city which turned to Pei for urban renewal during this time was Providence, Rhode Island. In the late 1960s, Providence hired Pei to redesign Cathedral Square, a once-bustling civic center which had become neglected and empty, as part of an ambitious larger plan to redesign downtown. Pei's new plaza, modeled after the Greek Agora marketplace, opened in 1972. The city ran out of money before Pei's vision could be fully realized. Also, recent construction of a low-income housing complex and Interstate 95 had changed the neighborhood's character permanently. In 1974, The Providence Evening Bulletin called Pei's new plaza a \\\"conspicuous failure\\\". By 2016, media reports characterized the plaza as a neglected, little-visited \\\"hidden gem\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Augusta, Georgia ===\\n\\nIn 1974, the city of Augusta, Georgia turned to Pei and his firm for downtown revitalization. The Chamber of Commerce building and Bicentennial Park were completed from his plan. In 1976, Pei designed a distinctive modern penthouse that was added to the roof of architect William Lee Stoddart's historic Lamar Building, designed in 1916.  In 1980, Pei and his company designed the Augusta Civic Center, now known as the James Brown Arena.\\n\\n\\n=== Dallas City Hall ===\\n\\nKennedy's assassination also led indirectly to another commission for Pei's firm. In 1964 the acting mayor of Dallas, Erik Jonsson, began working to change the community's image. Dallas was known and disliked as the city where the president had been killed, but Jonsson began a program designed to initiate a community renewal. One of the goals was a new city hall, which could be a \\\"symbol of the people\\\". Jonsson, a co-founder of Texas Instruments, learned about Pei from his associate Cecil Howard Green, who had recruited the architect for MIT's Earth Sciences building.\\nPei's approach to the new Dallas City Hall mirrored those of other projects; he surveyed the surrounding area and worked to make the building fit. In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents of the city and was impressed by their civic pride. He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector. He spoke of creating \\\"a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises\\\".\\nWorking with his associate Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design centered on a building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees, which shades the building from the Texas sun. A plaza stretches out before the building, and a series of support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's High Court building in Chandigarh, India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify the building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years to complete. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.\\nThe city of Dallas received the building well, and a local television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially opened to the public in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: \\\"It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse.\\\" He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.\\n\\n\\n=== Hancock Tower, Boston ===\\n\\nWhile Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate Henry Cobb had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. John Hancock Insurance chairman Robert Slater hired I. M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the Prudential Tower, erected by their rival.\\nAfter the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the Trinity Church and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a \\\"background and foil\\\" to the older structures around it. When the Hancock Tower was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in New England.\\n\\nSerious issues of execution became evident in the tower almost immediately. Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. The entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels, significantly increasing costs. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I. M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were \\\"not good and workmanlike\\\". LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I. M. Pei & Partners sued LOF in return. All three companies settled out of court in 1981.\\nThe project became an albatross for Pei's firm. Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in Australia and Pei took on jobs in Singapore, Iran, and Kuwait. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. \\\"Going through this trial toughened us,\\\" he said. \\\"It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== National Gallery East Building, Washington, DC ===\\n\\nIn the mid-1960s, directors of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., declared the need for a new building. Paul Mellon, a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant J. Carter Brown (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the Library of Alexandria. After inspecting Pei's work at the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa and the Johnson Museum at Cornell University, they offered him the commission.\\nPei took to the project with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had recently recruited to the firm, William Pedersen and Yann Weymouth. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a trapezoid of land at the intersection of Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: \\\"No compromises.\\\"\\nThe growing popularity of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, Pei designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights. Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room. A large mobile sculpture by American artist Alexander Calder was later added to the lobby. Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting to the public in the same way as the central room of the Guggenheim Museum is in New York City. The modern museum, he said later, \\\"must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young\\\".\\n\\nMaterials for the building's exterior were chosen with careful precision. To match the look and texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick blocks and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the bottom and lighter blocks on top.\\nThe East Building was honored on May 30, 1978, two days before its public unveiling, with a black-tie party attended by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. Ada Louise Huxtable wrote in The New York Times that Pei's building was \\\"a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture\\\". The sharp angle of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become stained and worn from the hands of visitors.\\nSome critics disliked the unusual design, however, and criticized the reliance on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for Artforum, critic Richard Hennessy described a \\\"shocking fun-house atmosphere\\\" and \\\"aura of ancient Roman patronage\\\". One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. Allan Greenberg had scorned the design when it was first unveiled, but wrote later to J. Carter Brown: \\\"I am forced to admit that you are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Fragrant Hills, China ===\\nAfter U.S. President Richard Nixon made his famous 1972 visit to China, a wave of exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a delegation of the American Institute of Architects in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series of lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.\\n\\nIn 1978, Pei was asked to initiate a project for his home country. After surveying a number of different locations, Pei fell in love with a valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as Fragrant Hills. The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to tear it down and build a new one. As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose. Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting. Thus, he said, it was necessary to find \\\"a third way\\\".\\nAfter visiting his ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration of the relationship between enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favor with government officials and architects.\\nThe hotel, with 325 guest rooms and a four-story central atrium, was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat. The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible. He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country. Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting 230 short tons (210 t) of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic. An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project.\\nDuring construction, a series of mistakes collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders. Whereas 200 or so workers might have been used for a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000 workers. This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used elsewhere. The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials. He later explained that his actions included \\\"shouting and pounding the table\\\" in frustration. The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting. As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work. He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors. The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family.\\nThe Fragrant Hill Hotel opened on October 17, 1982, but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff returned for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings. The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered on the work of American postmodernists such as Michael Graves.\\n\\n\\n=== Javits Convention Center, New York ===\\n\\nAs the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei began work on the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, for which his associate James Freed served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in what was then a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate space frame of interconnected metal rods and spheres.\\nThe convention center was plagued from the start by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes to be used in the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects: 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on April 3, 1986, to a generally positive reception.\\n\\n\\n=== Grand Louvre, Paris ===\\n\\nWhen Fran\\u00e7ois Mitterrand was elected President of France in 1981, he laid out an ambitious plan for a variety of construction projects. One of these was the renovation of the Louvre. Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named \\u00c9mile Biasini to oversee it. After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the U.S. National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team. The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there. Pei finally agreed that a new construction project was not only possible, but necessary for the future of the museum. He thus became the first foreign architect to work on the Louvre.\\nThe heart of the new design included not only a renovation of the Cour Napol\\u00e9on in the midst of the buildings, but also a transformation of the interiors. Pei proposed a central entrance, not unlike the lobby of the National Gallery East Building, which would link the three major wings around the central space. Below would be a complex of additional floors for research, storage, and maintenance purposes. At the center of the courtyard he designed a glass and steel pyramid, first proposed with the Kennedy Library, to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight. It was mirrored by an inverted pyramid to the west, to reflect sunlight into the complex. These designs were partly an homage to the fastidious geometry of the French landscape architect Andr\\u00e9 Le N\\u00f4tre. Pei also found the pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency, and considered it \\\"most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre, especially with the faceted planes of its roofs\\\".\\nBiasini and Mitterrand liked the plans, but the scope of the renovation displeased Louvre administrator Andr\\u00e9 Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was \\\"unfeasible\\\" and posed \\\"architectural risks\\\". Some sections of the French public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid. One critic called it a \\\"gigantic, ruinous gadget\\\"; another charged Mitterrand with \\\"despotism\\\" for inflicting Paris with the \\\"atrocity\\\". Pei estimated that 90 percent of Parisians opposed his design. \\\"I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris,\\\" he said. Some condemnations carried nationalistic overtones. One opponent wrote: \\\"I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France.\\\"\\n\\nSoon, however, Pei and his team won the support of several key cultural icons, including the conductor Pierre Boulez and Claude Pompidou, widow of former French President Georges Pompidou, after whom the similarly controversial Centre Georges Pompidou was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac and placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000 people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid.\\nPei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes. The pyramid was constructed at the same time as the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages. As they worked, construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25,000 historical items; these were incorporated into the rest of the structure to add a new exhibition zone.\\nThe new Cour Napol\\u00e9on was opened to the public on October 14, 1988, and the Pyramid entrance was opened the following March. By this time, public opposition had softened; a poll found a 56 percent approval rating for the pyramid, with 23 percent still opposed. The newspaper Le Figaro had vehemently criticized Pei's design, but later celebrated the tenth anniversary of its magazine supplement at the pyramid. Prince Charles of Britain surveyed the new site with curiosity, and declared it \\\"marvelous, very exciting\\\". A writer in Le Quotidien de Paris wrote: \\\"The much-feared pyramid has become adorable.\\\"\\nThe experience was exhausting for Pei, but also rewarding. \\\"After the Louvre,\\\" he said later, \\\"I thought no project would be too difficult.\\\"  The pyramid achieved further widespread international recognition for its central role in the plot at the denouement of The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown and its appearance in the final scene of the subsequent screen adaptation. The Louvre Pyramid became Pei's most famous structure.\\n\\n\\n=== Meyerson Symphony Center, Dallas ===\\nThe opening of the Louvre Pyramid coincided with four other projects on which Pei had been working, prompting architecture critic Paul Goldberger to declare 1989 \\\"the year of Pei\\\" in The New York Times. It was also the year in which Pei's firm changed its name to Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, to reflect the increasing stature and prominence of his associates. At the age of 72, Pei had begun thinking about retirement, but continued working long hours to see his designs come to light.\\n\\nOne of the projects took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center. The success of city's performing artists, particularly the Dallas Symphony Orchestra then led by conductor Eduardo Mata, led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in Europe. The organizing committee contacted 45 architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that his work on the Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression. One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee. He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission. As one member put it: \\\"We were convinced that we would get the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward.\\\"\\nBecause its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on acoustics first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a shoebox auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and Vienna Musikverein. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect Johann Balthasar Neumann, especially the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the Paris Op\\u00e9ra designed by Charles Garnier.\\nPei's design placed the rigid shoebox at an angle to the surrounding street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like filigree. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. \\\"I can imagine only 60 percent of the space in this building,\\\" he said during the early stages. \\\"The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else.\\\" As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon Ross Perot made a donation of US$10 million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.\\nThe building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending a week of performances in the hall, a music critic for The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was \\\"a very mature building\\\"; he smiled and replied: \\\"Ah, but did I have to wait this long?\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Bank of China, Hong Kong ===\\nA new offer had arrived for Pei from the Chinese government in 1982. With an eye toward the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hills, he agreed to accept the commission.\\nThe proposed site in Hong Kong's Central District was less than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World War II, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in Katonah, New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.\\nPei felt that his design for the Bank of China Tower needed to reflect \\\"the aspirations of the Chinese people\\\".  The design that he developed for the skyscraper was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The building is composed of four triangular shafts rising up from a square base, supported by a visible truss structure that distributes stress to the four corners of the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around  diagonal bracing in a union of structure and form that reiterates the triangle motif established in the plan. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.\\nAs the tower neared completion, Pei was shocked to witness the government's massacre of unarmed civilians at the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times titled \\\"China Won't Ever Be the Same\\\", in which he said that the killings \\\"tore the heart out of a generation that carries the hope for the future of the country\\\". The massacre deeply disturbed his entire family, and he wrote that \\\"China is besmirched.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== 1990\\u20132019: museum projects ===\\n\\nAs the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm. The staff had begun to shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set to work on his last major project as active partner: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and U.S. National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. Pei accepted the commission in part because of the unique challenge it presented.\\nUsing a glass wall for the entrance, similar in appearance to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated the exterior of the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space. The combination of off-centered wraparounds and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide \\\"a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about\\\".\\nThe building opened in 1995, and was received with moderate praise. The New York Times called it \\\"a fine building\\\", but Pei was among those who felt disappointed with the results. The museum's early beginnings in New York combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed. Although the city of Cleveland benefited greatly from the new tourist attraction, Pei was unhappy with it.\\nAt the same time, Pei designed a new museum for Luxembourg, the Mus\\u00e9e d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, commonly known as the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Th\\u00fcngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.\\nIn 1995, Pei was hired to design an extension to the Deutsches Historisches Museum, or German Historical Museum in Berlin. Returning to the challenge of the East Building of the U.S. National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a modernist approach with a classical main structure. He described the glass cylinder addition as a \\\"beacon\\\", and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics. \\\"They thought I was nothing but trouble\\\", he said.\\nPei also worked at this time on two projects for a new Japanese religious movement called Shinji Shumeikai. He was approached by the movement's spiritual leader, Kaishu Koyama, who impressed the architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom. One of the buildings was a bell tower, designed to resemble the bachi used when playing traditional instruments like the shamisen. Pei was unfamiliar with the movement's beliefs, but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in the tower. As he said: \\\"It was a search for the sort of expression that is not at all technical.\\\"\\n\\nThe experience was rewarding for Pei, and he agreed immediately to work with the group again. The new project was the Miho Museum, to display Koyama's collection of tea ceremony artifacts. Pei visited the site in Shiga Prefecture, and during their conversations convinced Koyama to expand her collection. She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300 items showcasing the history of the Silk Road.\\nOne major challenge was the approach to the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80 percent of the building underground.\\nWhen designing the exterior, Pei borrowed from the tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby Kyoto. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone and covered with a glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old keyaki tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350 million.\\nDuring the first decade of the 2000s, Pei designed a variety of buildings, including the Suzhou Museum near his childhood home. He also designed the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar, at the request of the Al-Thani Family. Although it was originally planned for the corniche road along Doha Bay, Pei convinced the project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.\\nOnce again, Pei sought to combine new design elements with the classical aesthetic most appropriate for the location of the building. The sand-colored rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior. Inside, galleries are arranged around a massive atrium, lit from above. The museum's coordinators were pleased with the project; its official website describes its \\\"true splendour unveiled in the sunlight,\\\" and speaks of \\\"the shades of colour and the interplay of shadows paying tribute to the essence of Islamic architecture\\\".\\n\\nThe Macao Science Center in Macau was designed by Pei Partnership Architects in association with I. M. Pei. The project to build the science center was conceived in 2001 and construction started in 2006. The center was completed in 2009 and opened by the Chinese President Hu Jintao. The main part of the building is a distinctive conical shape with a spiral walkway and large atrium inside, similar to that of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Galleries lead off the walkway, mainly consisting of interactive exhibits aimed at science education. The building is in a prominent position by the sea and is now a Macau landmark.\\nPei's career ended with his death in May 2019, at 102 years of age.\\n\\n\\n== Style and method ==\\nPei's style was described as thoroughly modernist, with significant cubist themes. He was known for combining traditional architectural principles with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns\\u2014circles, squares, and triangles are common elements of his work in both plan and elevation. As one critic wrote: \\\"Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method.\\\" In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei \\\"the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice\\\". At the same time, Pei himself rejected simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: The talk about modernism versus post-modernism is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style in which it is going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community. How does it affect life?\\nPei's work is celebrated throughout the world of architecture. His colleague John Portman once told him: \\\"Just once, I'd like to do something like the East Building.\\\" But this originality did not always bring large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: \\\"Just once, I'd like to make the kind of money you do.\\\" His concepts, moreover, were too individualized and dependent on context to have given rise to a particular school of design. Pei referred to his own \\\"analytical approach\\\" when explaining the lack of a \\\"Pei School\\\".\\n\\\"For me,\\\" he said, \\\"the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose ... My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements ... to arrive at an ideal balance among them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\nIn the words of his biographer, Pei won \\\"every award of any consequence in his art\\\", including the Arnold Brunner Award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1963), the Gold Medal for Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1979), the AIA Gold Medal (1979), the first Praemium Imperiale for Architecture from the Japan Art Association (1989), the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, the 1998 Edward MacDowell Medal in the Arts, and the 2010 Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1983 he was awarded the Pritzker Prize, sometimes referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture. In its citation, the jury said: \\\"Ieoh Ming Pei has given this century some of its most beautiful interior spaces and exterior forms ... His versatility and skill in the use of materials approach the level of poetry.\\\" The prize was accompanied by a US$100,000 award, which Pei used to create a scholarship for Chinese students to study architecture in the U.S., on the condition that they return to China to work. In 1986, he was one of twelve recipients of the Medal of Liberty. When he was awarded the 2003 Henry C. Turner Prize by the National Building Museum, museum board chair Carolyn Brody praised his impact on construction innovation: \\\"His magnificent designs have challenged engineers to devise innovative structural solutions, and his exacting expectations for construction quality have encouraged contractors to achieve high standards.\\\" In December 1992, Pei was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush. In 1996, Pei became the first person to be elected a foreign member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Pei was also an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nPei's wife, Eileen Loo, died on June 20, 2014. Together they had three sons, T'ing Chung (1945\\u20132003), Chien Chung (1946\\u20132023; known as Didi), and Li Chung (b. 1949; known as Sandi); and a daughter, Liane (b. 1960). T'ing Chung was an urban planner and alumnus of his father's alma mater MIT and Harvard. Chieng Chung and Li Chung, who are both Harvard Graduate School of Design alumni, founded and run Pei Partnership Architects. Liane is a lawyer.\\nIn 2015, Pei's home health aide, Eter Nikolaishvili, grabbed Pei's right forearm and twisted it, resulting in bruising and bleeding and hospital treatment. Pei alleged that the assault occurred when Pei threatened to call the police about Nikolaishvili. Nikolaishvili agreed to plead guilty in 2016.\\nPei celebrated his 100th birthday on April 26, 2017. He died at his Manhattan apartment on May 16, 2019, at the age of 102.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nIn the 2021 parody film America: The Motion Picture, I. M.

Born in Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but his studies\\u2014and the early stages of his career\\u2014were curtailed by the Second World War. After his demobilisation he returned to acting and found success, initially in revue and sketch productions.\\nIn 1955 Carmichael was noticed by the film producers John and Roy Boulting, who cast him in five of their films as one of the major players. The first was the 1956 film Private's Progress, a satire on the British Army; he received critical and popular praise for the role, including from the American market. In many of his roles he played a likeable, often accident-prone, innocent. In the mid-1960s he played Bertie Wooster in adaptations of the works of P. G. Wodehouse in The World of Wooster for BBC Television, for which he received mostly positive reviews, including from Wodehouse. In the early 1970s he played another upper-class literary character, Lord Peter Wimsey, the amateur but talented investigator created by Dorothy L. Sayers.\\nMuch of Carmichael's success came through a disciplined approach to training and rehearsing for a role. He learned much about the craft and technique of humour while appearing with the comic actor Leo Franklyn. Although Carmichael tired of being typecast as the affable but bumbling upper-class Englishman, his craft ensured that while audiences laughed at his antics, he retained their affection; Dennis Barker, in Carmichael's obituary in The Guardian, wrote that he \\\"could play fool parts in a way that did not cut the characters completely off from human sympathy: a certain dignity was always maintained\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\n\\nIan Gillett Carmichael was born on 18 June 1920 in Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He was the eldest child of Kate (n\\u00e9e Gillett) and her husband Arthur Denholm Carmichael, an optician on the premises of his family's firm of jewellers. Carmichael had two younger sisters, the twins Mary and Margaret, who were born in December 1923. Robert Fairclough, his biographer, describes Carmichael's upbringing as a \\\"privileged, pampered existence\\\"; his parents employed maids and a cook. His infant education included one term at the local Froebel House School when he was four, but this was curtailed after his parents were shocked at the \\\"alarmingly foul language he began bringing home\\\", according to Alex Jennings, Carmichael's biographer in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.\\nIn 1928 Carmichael was sent to Scarborough College, a prep school in North Yorkshire, which he attended between the ages of seven and thirteen. He did not like the spartan and authoritarian regime at the school. He described the discipline as \\\"Dickensian\\\", with corporal punishment used for even minor infringements of the rules; ablutions in the morning and evening were conducted with cold water\\u2014which often had a film of ice on the top during winter.\\nIn 1933 Carmichael left Scarborough College and entered Bromsgrove School, a public school in Worcestershire. He soon concluded that \\\"the new curriculum was not arduous\\\", which gave him the opportunity for focus on matters that were of more interest for him: acting, popular music and cricket. In the late 1930s Carmichael decided to go to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His parents would have preferred he went into the family jewellery business, but accepted their son's decision and supported him financially when he left Yorkshire for London in January 1939.\\n\\n\\n=== Early career and war service, 1939\\u20131946 ===\\n\\nCarmichael enjoyed his time at RADA, including the fact that women outnumbered men on his course, which he described as \\\"heady stuff\\\" after his boys-only boarding school. He remembered the time at RADA in the late 1930s fondly in his autobiography, describing it as:\\n\\nA period of unconfined joy, occasioned by my finally shaking off the shackles of school discipline and being able to mix daily with young men and young women who shared my interests and enthusiasms. This joy was, nevertheless, being tempered by the worsening European situation. The fear that now, just as I was standing on the threshold of a future that I had dreamed about for years, the whole thing might be snuffed out like a candle was too unbearable to contemplate.\\nDuring his second term Carmichael had his first professional acting role: as a robot in Karel \\u010capek's R.U.R. at the People's Palace theatre, in Mile End, East London. He recalled the experience as \\\"a dull play performed in a cold and uninspiring theatre and my particular contribution required absolutely no acting talent whatsoever\\\". He then appeared as Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream at RADA's Vanbrugh Theatre. The opening night was 1 September 1939, the day Hitler invaded Poland. After the play's second performance its run was ended, as RADA shut down in anticipation that war was about to be declared; the following day the UK joined the war. Carmichael returned to his familial home and completed the forms to join the Officer Cadet Reserve, hoping to be commissioned as an officer. He helped gather the harvest in a nearby farm until 2 October, when he was attested into the army; he was told he would have to wait until he was twenty\\u2014on 18 June 1940\\u2014before he started training.\\nAs the early months of the war were marked by limited military action, RADA reassessed its closure, and decided to reopen. Carmichael returned to London and shared lodgings with two fellow RADA students, Geoffrey Hibbert and Patrick Macnee; Carmichael and Macnee became lifelong friends. Between June and August 1940 Carmichael was on a ten-week tour of Nine Sharp, a revue developed by Herbert Farjeon. After the tour Carmichael reported for training on 12 September at Catterick Garrison. After ten weeks' basic training, he was posted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to become an officer cadet. He completed his training and passed out in March 1941 as a second lieutenant in the 22nd Dragoons, part of the Royal Armoured Corps.\\nAt the end of training manoeuvres in November 1941, near Whitby, North Yorkshire, Carmichael was struggling to close the hatch of his Valentine tank when it slammed down, cutting off the top of a finger on his left hand. The surgery was botched and caused him pain for several months; he had a second operation several months later. He described it as \\\"dashed unfortunate\\\" and \\\"my one and only war-wound, albeit a self-inflicted one\\\".\\nIn between training for the liberation of France Carmichael began producing revues and productions as part of his brigade's entertainment. On 16 June 1944, ten days after D-Day, Carmichael and his armoured reconnaissance troop landed in France. He fought through to Germany with the regiment and by the time of Victory in Europe Day in May 1945, he had been promoted to captain and mentioned in despatches.\\n\\nCarmichael's regiment was part of 30 Corps and an initial post-war challenge in Germany was the welfare of the occupying forces. The corps' commanding officer was Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, who ordered a repertory company to be formed for entertainment. When Carmichael auditioned he recognised the major in charge of the unit as Richard Stone, an actor who had been a contemporary at RADA; Carmichael was taken into the company and assisted Stone with auditioning other members. One of the comedians who auditioned was Frankie Howerd, whom Carmichael thought \\\"very gauche ... too undisciplined and not very funny either. Very much the amateur\\\". Stone disagreed and signed the comic up to perform in a Royal Army Service Corps concert party. The corps' company was also joined by actors from Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA); Carmichael did not often appear on stage with them, but worked as the producer of twenty shows. In April 1946 Stone was promoted and was transferred to the UK; Carmichael was promoted to major and took control of the theatrical company. His leadership of the company was short-lived, as he was demobilised that July.\\n\\n\\n=== Early post-war career, 1946\\u20131955 ===\\nIn July 1946 Carmichael signed with Stone, who had also been demobilised and had set up as a theatrical agent. Carmichael obtained his first post-war role in the revue Between Ourselves in mid-1946 before he appeared in two small roles in the comedy She Wanted a Cream Front Door\\u2014 a hotel receptionist and a BBC reporter. The production went on a twelve-week tour round Britain from October 1946, and then ran at the Apollo Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, London, for four months.\\nBetween 1947 and 1951 Carmichael appeared on stage in both plays and revues \\u2014the latter often at the Players' Theatre in Villiers Street, Charing Cross. He made his debut appearance on BBC television in 1947 in New Faces, a revue that also included Zoe Gail, Bill Fraser and Charles Hawtrey. From 1948 he also began appearing in films, including Bond Street (1948), Trottie True and Dear Mr. Prohack (both 1949); these early roles were minor parts and he was uncredited. He spent much of 1949 in a thirty-week tour of Britain with the operetta The Lilac Domino. According to Jennings, Carmichael's \\\"first conspicuous success\\\" was The Lyric Revue in 1951; the production transferred to The Globe (now the Gielgud Theatre) as The Globe Revue in 1952. He received a positive review in the industry publication The Stage, which reported that he \\\"hits the bull's-eye\\\" for his comic performance in one sketch, \\\"Bank Holiday\\\", which involved him undressing on the beach under a mackintosh.\\nCarmichael spent the next three years appearing in stage revues and small roles in films. Although he enjoyed working in revues, he was concerned about being stuck in a career rut. In a 1954 interview in The Stage, he said \\\"I'm afraid that managers and directors may think of me only as a revue artist, and much as I enjoy acting in sketches I feel there must be a limit to the number of characters one is able to create. What I would like now is to be offered a part in light comedy or a farce\\\". Between November 1954 and May 1955 he appeared as David Prentice in the stage production of Simon and Laura alongside Roland Culver and Coral Browne at the Strand Theatre, London. The following year a film version was directed by Muriel Box; she asked Carmichael to repeat his role, while Browne and Culver's roles were taken by Kay Kendall and Peter Finch. The reviewer for The Times thought Carmichael \\\"comes near to stealing the film from both of them\\\". In 1955 Carmichael also appeared in The Colditz Story. He played Robin Cartwright, an officer in the Guards, and spent much of his screen time appearing with Richard Wattis; the two men provided an element of comic relief in the film, with what Fairclough describes as a \\\"Flanagan and Allen tribute act\\\". The Colditz Story was Carmichael's ninth film role and he had, Fairclough notes, risen to sixth in the credits behind John Mills and Eric Portman.\\n\\n\\n=== Screen success, 1955\\u20131962 ===\\n\\nIn 1955 Carmichael was contacted by the filmmaker twins the Boulting brothers. They wanted him to appear in two film versions of novels\\u2014Private's Progress by Alan Hackney and Brothers in Law by Henry Cecil\\u2014with an option for five films in all; the final contract was for a total of six films. The Boultings' first work with Carmichael was the 1956 film Private's Progress, a satire on the British Army. The film opened in February 1956 and starred Carmichael, Richard Attenborough, Dennis Price and Terry-Thomas. The film historian Alan Boulton observed \\\"Reviews were decidedly mixed and the critical response did not match the popular enthusiasm for the film\\\"; it was either the second or third most popular film at the British box office that year. Carmichael received praise for his role, however, including from The Manchester Guardian, which thought he \\\"fulfils his promise as a comedian\\\"; the reviewer for The Times thought Carmichael acted \\\"with an unfailing tact and sympathy\\u2014he even manages to make a drunken scene seem rich in comedy\\\". The film introduced American audiences to Carmichael, and his screen presence in the US was warmly received by reviewers. The reviewer Margaret Hinxman, writing in Picturegoer, considered that after Private's Progress Carmichael had become \\\"one of Britain's choicest screen exports\\\".\\nFrom June to September 1956 Carmichael was involved in the filming of Brothers in Law, which was directed by Roy Boulting; others in the cast included Attenborough and Terry-Thomas. When the film was released in March 1957 Carmichael received positive reviews, including from Philip Oakes, the reviewer from The Evening Standard, who concluded that Carmichael \\\"confirms his placing in my form book as our best light comedian\\\". The reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought Carmichael was \\\"irrepressibly funny in his well-bred, well-intentioned, bewildered ineptitude\\\".\\n\\nIn September 1957 Carmichael appeared in a third Boulting brothers film, Lucky Jim in which he appeared alongside Terry-Thomas and Hugh Griffith in an adaptation of a 1954 novel by Kingsley Amis. Fairclough notes that while the film was not well received by the critics, Carmichael's performance received great praise. The Manchester Guardian considered that Carmichael, \\\"although in many ways excellent, has fewer chances than in Brothers-in-Law to delight us with those studies in agonised embarrassment in which he excels\\\", while The Daily Telegraph reviewer considered \\\"[Carmichael's] Jim, complete with North-Country accent and the ability to pull comic faces, might so easily have been the author's creation brought to life off the page.\\\"\\nCarmichael then appeared in a fourth film with the Boultings, Happy Is the Bride, a lightweight comedy of manners released in March 1958 which also included Janette Scott, Cecil Parker, Terry-Thomas and Joyce Grenfell. Carmichael spent much of the end of 1957 and most of 1958 on stage with The Tunnel of Love. The journalist R. B. Marriott described it as a \\\"slightly crazy, wonderfully ridiculous comedy\\\", and it had a five-week tour around the UK which preceded a run at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, between December 1957 and August 1958. During the run, in April 1958, Carmichael was interviewed for Desert Island Discs by Roy Plomley on the BBC Home Service.\\nCarmichael once again appeared as Stanley Windrush, the character he portrayed in Private's Progress, in his fifth film with the Boultings, I'm All Right Jack, which was released in August 1959. Several other actors from Private's Progress also reprised their roles: Price (as Bertram Tracepurcel); Attenborough (as Sidney De Vere Cox) and Terry-Thomas (as Major Hitchcock). A new character was introduced in the film, Peter Sellers as the trade union shop steward Fred Kite. The film was the highest-grossing at the British box office in 1960 and earned Sellers the award for Best British Actor at the 13th British Academy Film Awards. Although Sellers received most of the plaudits for the film, Carmichael was given good reviews for his role, with The Illustrated London News saying he was \\\"in excellent fooling\\\" and \\\"delicious both at work and at play\\\". In 1960 Carmichael appeared in School for Scoundrels, based on Stephen Potter's \\\"gamesmanship\\\" series of books.  Appearing alongside him were Terry-Thomas, Alastair Sim and Janette Scott. The reviews for the film were not positive, but the actors were praised for their work in it.\\nThe release of School for Scoundrels was Carmichael's tenth film in five years. Fairclough observes that during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Carmichael began to get a reputation among his colleagues as being difficult to work with. Eric Maschwitz, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment for Television, recorded in an internal memo that Carmichael had given \\\"great difficulty\\\" during negotiations, and concluded that \\\"his head seems to have been a little turned by his success\\\". Some actors had to point out to him that he was \\\"doing a Carmichael\\\" whenever he tried to improve his billing, or upstage his fellow actors, including Derek Nimmo in 1962, during the filming of The Amorous Prawn. Despite the criticism, Carmichael described the period as \\\"I think the happiest five or six years of my whole career\\\".\\nIn December 1961 Carmichael was appearing in the comedy mystery play The Gazebo every evening and filming Double Bunk during the day. The mental and physical toll on him was too much, and he collapsed in the middle of a performance. The show's producer, Harold Fielding, instructed Carmichael to take at least two week's holiday to rest, and he paid for Carmichael and his wife to have a holiday in Switzerland. He returned to the show on 23 December, but he lost his voice during the Boxing Day show and could only complete Act 1. He returned to the show after a few days, but left permanently on 28 January 1962 on his doctor's orders.\\n\\n\\n=== Wooster and Wimsey, 1962\\u20131979 ===\\n\\nTastes in film changed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with the new wave of British films moving away from plots centred on the upper classes and the establishment, to works such as Look Back in Anger, Room at the Top (both 1959), Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962), where working class drama came to the fore. One of the effects of the new movement was a downturn in the number of films that wanted a character like those normally played by Carmichael. He was still being offered some film roles, but all, he said, \\\"were variations on the same old bumbling, accident-prone clot\\\" with which he was becoming increasingly bored.\\nIn August 1964 the BBC approached Carmichael to discuss the possibility of his taking the role of Bertie Wooster\\u2014described by Fairclough as \\\"the misadventuring, 1920s upper-class loafer\\\"\\u2014for adaptations of the works of P. G. Wodehouse. He turned it down, as he had agreed to appear on Broadway, taking the lead in a production of the farce Boeing-Boeing. He appeared at the Cort Theatre in February 1965, but the run ended after 23 performances, as the farce was not to the taste of New York audiences. Carmichael was delighted by the early close, as he hated his time in the US and said \\\"I found New York a disturbing, violent city and I disliked it instantly\\\". As soon as he heard the production was to close, he sent a telegram to the BBC to note his availability to play Wooster. Carmichael negotiated a fee of 500 guineas (\\u00a3525) per half-hour episode, and assisted in finding the right person for Jeeves, eventually selecting Dennis Price.\\nThe first series of The World of Wooster received the Guild of Television Producers and Directors award for best comedy series production of 1965, and the programme ran for three series, broadcast between May 1965 and November 1967, comprising twenty episodes in total. Reviews for Carmichael were positive, with a reviewer in The Times declaring \\\"The World of Wooster is also a triumph of casting, for Ian Carmichael and Dennis Price are perfect impersonators of two characters who are by no means lay-figures ... They are a priceless pair.\\\" A different reviewer pointed out one drawback of the 44-year-old Carmichael's performance: \\\"If we have thought of Bertie Wooster as eternally 22, not far in time from enjoyably wasted university days, Mr. Ian Carmichael opposes our view with a Bertie who is older but hopefully fixed in an inescapable mental youth.\\\" The best review, as far as Carmichael and the producer Michael Mills were concerned, was from Wodehouse, who sent a telegram to the BBC:\\n\\nTo the producer and cast of the Jeeves sketches.\\nThank you all for the perfectly wonderful performances. I am simply delighted with it. Bertie and Jeeves are just as I have always imagined them, and every part is played just right.\\nBless you!\\n\\nP. G. Wodehouse\\nWodehouse later reconsidered his opinion and thought Carmichael overacted in the role. Only one of the episodes remains: the others were wiped to reuse the expensive videotape.\\nIn September 1970 Carmichael was the lead role in Bachelor Father, a sitcom loosely based on the true story of a single man who fostered twelve children. There were two series\\u2014one in 1970, one the following year\\u2014and a total of 22 episodes; he negotiated a salary of \\u00a31,500 per episode, making him the best-paid actor at the BBC. The media historian Mark Lewisohn thought that the programme, \\\"although ostensibly a middle-of-the-road family sitcom of no great ambition, came over as a polished and professional piece of work that pleased audiences over two extended series\\\".\\nCarmichael was one of the driving forces behind the BBC's decision to adapt Dorothy L. Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey stories for television. He first had the idea of appearing as Wimsey in 1966, but various factors\\u2014including financing, Carmichael's association with Bertie Wooster in the public's eye and difficulty obtaining the rights\\u2014delayed the project. By January 1971, however, they were able to start filming the first programme, Clouds of Witness, which was broadcast in 1972 in five parts. This was followed by The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, Murder Must Advertise, The Nine Tailors and  The Five Red Herrings between February 1973 and August 1975. Richard Last, writing in The Daily Telegraph thought Carmichael was \\\"an inspired piece of casting. ... he has exactly the right outward touch of aristocratic frivolity but more than the ability to suggest the steel underneath\\\". Clive James, reviewing for The Observer, described Carmichael as \\\"an extremely clever actor\\\", and thought he was \\\"turning in one of those thespian efforts which seem easy at the time but which in retrospect are found to have been the ideal embodiment of the written character\\\". Carmichael went on to play Wimsey on BBC Radio 4, recording nine adaptations with Peter Jones as Mervyn Bunter, Wimsey's valet.\\nIn 1979 Carmichael appeared in The Lady Vanishes, which starred Elliott Gould and Cybill Shepherd; the film was a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1938 film of the same name. Carmichael appeared as Caldicott alongside Arthur Lowe's character Charters, two cricket-obsessed English gentlemen; the roles were played in the original by Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford. The journalist Patrick Humphries, while describing the film as \\\"lamentable\\\", thought that only Carmichael and Lowe \\\"emerge with any credibility\\\". Carmichael was interviewed on Desert Island Discs for a second time in June 1979.\\n\\n\\n=== Semi-retirement, 1979\\u20132009 ===\\nIn 1979 Carmichael published his autobiography Will the Real Ian Carmichael ..., which marked what Fairclough calls his \\\"semi-retirement\\\" in Yorkshire. He continued to work periodically, including providing the voice for Rat in the 1983 film The Wind in the Willows and as the narrator for the television series of the same name between 1984 and 1990. He revisited the works of Wodehouse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, providing the voice of Galahad Threepwood for two radio productions, Pigs Have Wings and Galahad at Blandings.\\nIn 1992 and 1993 he played Sir James Menzies in two series of Strathblair, a BBC family drama set in 1950 broadcast on Sunday evenings. He undertook his last stage role in June 1995, playing Sir Peter Teazle in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The School for Scandal at the Chichester Festival Theatre. From 2003 he took his final role: that of T. J. Middleditch in the ITV hospital drama series The Royal. He continued filming with The Royal until 2009.\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\nIn late March 1941, when Carmichael's regiment was posted to Whitby he met \\\"Pym\\\"\\u2014Jean Pyman Maclean\\u2014who he described as \\\"blonde, just eighteen, five feet six, sensationally pretty and a beautiful dancer\\\"; he thought her personality was \\\"warm ... genuine. There was an innocence about her, an unsophistication that disarmed even the most worldly\\\". The couple became engaged in May 1942 and married on 6 October 1943; they had two daughters, Lee (born in 1946) and Sally (born in 1949). Pym died of cancer in 1983.\\nIn 1984 Carmichael recorded a series of short stories for the BBC; the programmes were produced by Kate Fenton. They began a relationship and she left the BBC in 1985 and moved in with him in the Esk Valley, near Whitby. They were married in July 1992. Carmichael enjoyed playing and watching cricket, and listed it as one of this interests in Who's Who. He was a member of the Lord's Taverners cricket charity from 1956 until October 1976, and would relax on film sets playing a casual game with other members of the cast and crew, a practice he was introduced to by the Boulting brothers. He was also a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club.\\nIn 2003 Carmichael was appointed OBE for services to drama. He died on 5 February 2010 of a pulmonary embolism.\\n\\n\\n== Screen persona and technique ==\\nCarmichael learned much of his technique from the thirty-week tour of The Lilac Domino he undertook in the late 1940s, where he appeared opposite the comic actor Leo Franklyn. Carmichael acknowledged the credit for his development as a light comic actor went \\\"in its entirety to the training, coaxing and encouragement of ... Franklyn\\\", who \\\"showed me how to time my laughs and how to play an audience\\\". Carmichael's experience in revue helped when he worked in a dramatic play; his experience in getting a character across to an audience quickly in a short sketch showed him that \\\"it is very important to establish a comedy character as soon as possible. Your whole performance may depend on this being done\\\".\\nCarmichael polished his performances through extensive rehearsals and training. The screenwriter Paul Dehn acknowledges the effort and discipline needed by Carmichael to achieve a polished feel to his act, describing how Carmichael would \\\"slave for hours to perfect one stumble on a stairway and, having got it, ... [would] make it seem effortless thereafter\\\". Jennings considers much of Carmichael's seemingly effortless light touch \\\"was built on a hugely disciplined and virtuosic technique\\\". Carmichael's choice of comedy was character-, rather than situation-based and when the film or play generated its atmosphere from normal, recognisable aspects of life. He selected his work projects carefully and became involved in the development and production side as closely as possible, or initiated the project himself.\\nThe image he portrayed in many of his works was summarised by one obituarist as \\\"the affable, archetypal silly ass Englishman\\\" with a \\\"wide-eyed boyish grin, bemused courtesy and hapless, trusting manner\\\". He became somewhat typecast with the character, but audiences liked him in the role, and \\\"he polished this persona with great care\\\", according to his obituarist in The Daily Telegraph, even though he tired of playing the role so often. One of the attractions for the public was that he played his parts to get the audience's sympathy for the character, but with a measure of dignity that viewers could relate to. During Carmichael's semi-retirement, the Boulting brothers told him that they had not shown the range of his talents, and that \\\"perhaps they should not virtually have confined him to the playing of twerps\\\". When he took the role of Wimsey\\u2014the intelligent, cultured and effective investigator\\u2014the critic Nancy Banks-Smith wrote that \\\"it was high time that Ian Carmichael was given the opportunity to look intelligent\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Notes and references ==\\n\\n\\n=== Notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== References ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nIan Carmichael at IMDb\\nIan Carmichael discography at Discogs\\nBBC Humber feature on Ian Carmichael\",\n          \"Wayne Township is a township that is located in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States.\\nThe population was 1,296 at the time of the 2020 census, an increase over the figure of 1,200 that was tabulated in 2010.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nWayne Township appears in the 1876 Atlas of Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.

Born in Guangzhou into a Chinese family, Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the garden villas at [[Suzhou]], the traditional retreat of the [[scholar-gentry]] to which his family belonged. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s architecture school, but quickly transferred to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Unhappy with the focus on [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] at both schools, he spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially [[Le Corbusier]].\\n\\nAfter graduating, he joined the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (GSD) and befriended the [[Bauhaus]] architects [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]]. In 1948, Pei was recruited by New York City real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]], for whom he worked for seven years before establishing an independent design firm, I. M. Pei & Associates, in 1955. In 1966, that became I. M. Pei & Partners, and  became [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] in 1989. Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990. In his retirement, he worked as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons' architectural firm [[Pei Partnership Architects]].\\n\\nPei's first major recognition came with the [[Mesa Laboratory]] at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] in Colorado (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] in Massachusetts. He went on to design [[Dallas City Hall]] and the [[National Gallery of Art#Architecture|East Building]] of the [[National Gallery of Art]].<ref name=\\\":0\\\">{{cite web |last1=Goldberger |first1=Paul |title=I.M.

In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy when he designed [[Louvre Pyramid|a glass-and-steel pyramid]] for the [[Louvre]] in Paris. He designed the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]] in [[Dallas]], the [[Miho Museum]] in Japan, Shigaraki, near Kyoto, and the chapel of the junior and high school: MIHO Institute of Aesthetics, the [[Suzhou Museum]] in Suzhou,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://my-travel-in-china.com/category/jiangsu/ |title=Suzhou Museum \\u2013 Suzhou |website=my-travel-in-china.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321151846/https://my-travel-in-china.com/category/jiangsu/ |archive-date=March 21, 2019 |access-date=March 21, 2019}}</ref> [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]] in Qatar, and the [[Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art]] in Luxembourg.\\n\\nPei won prizes and awards in the field of architecture, including the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1979, the first [[Praemium Imperiale]] for Architecture in 1989, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]], in 2003.

It eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], who was recognized for her skills as a flautist. She invited him, but not his brothers or sisters, to join her on meditation retreats.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 31\\u201332; von Boehm, p. 25.</ref> His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.<ref name=\\\"Wiseman, p. 31\\\">Wiseman, p. 31.</ref>\\n\\nPei's ancestors' success meant that the family lived in the upper echelons of society, but Pei said his father was \\\"not cultivated in the ways of the arts\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 31.</ref> The younger Pei, drawn more to music and other cultural forms than to his father's domain of banking, explored art on his own. \\\"I have cultivated myself,\\\" he said later.<ref name=\\\"Wiseman, p. 31\\\" />\\n\\nPei studied in [[St. Paul's College, Hong Kong|St. Paul's College]] in Hong Kong as a child.

Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing [[Cue sports|billiards]] and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. He also learned rudimentary English by reading the Bible and novels by [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name=\\\"w3133\\\">Wiseman, pp. 31\\u201333.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Customs House and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Pedestrians walk before a row of trees and a series of tall buildings.

The [[Lion Grove Garden|Shizilin Garden]], built in the 14th century by a Buddhist monk and owned by Pei's uncle Bei Runsheng, was especially influential.

She was prescribed [[opium]] for pain and assigned the task of preparing her pipe to Pei. She died shortly after his thirteenth birthday, and he was profoundly upset.<ref>Boehm, p. 25.</ref> The children were sent to live with extended family, as their father became more consumed by his work.

He was accepted by a number of schools, but enrolled at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 33\\u201334.</ref> Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him.<ref>Wiseman, p. 34.</ref> The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of [[Bing Crosby]], which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. \\\"College life in the U.S. seemed to me to be mostly fun and games\\\", he said in 2000. \\\"Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it&nbsp;... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me.\\\"<ref>Boehm, p. 34.</ref> Pei added that \\\"Crosby's films in particular had a tremendous influence on my choosing the United States instead of England to pursue my education.\\\"<ref>Boehm, pp. 33\\u201334.</ref>\\n\\nIn 1935, Pei boarded a boat and sailed to [[San Francisco]], then traveled by train to [[Philadelphia]]. What he found once he arrived differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]], rooted in the classical traditions of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]. Pei was more intrigued by [[modern architecture]], and also felt intimidated by the high level of [[architectural drawing|drafting]] proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.<ref>Wiseman, p. 35.</ref>\\n\\nMIT's architecture faculty was also focused on the Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work. In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect [[Le Corbusier]]. Pei was inspired by the innovative designs of the new [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in {{Nowrap|November 1935}}, an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: \\\"The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vb36\\\">Boehm, p. 36.</ref> Pei was also influenced by the work of U.S. architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. In 1938 he drove to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]<!-- DO NOT LINK SEPARATELY, see [[MOS:GEOLINK]] for further guidance -->, to visit Wright's famous [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.<ref name=\\\"wright\\\">Boehm, p. 36; Wiseman, p. 36.</ref>\\n\\nAlthough he disliked the Beaux-Arts emphasis, Pei excelled in his studies. \\\"I certainly don't regret the time at MIT\\\", he said later. \\\"There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vb40\\\">Boehm, p. 40.</ref> Pei received his [[Bachelor of Architecture|BArch]] degree in 1940; his thesis was titled \\\"Standardized Propaganda Units for War Time and Peace Time China\\\".<ref>Boehm, pp. 40\\u201341.

They began dating and married in the spring of 1942. She enrolled in the [[landscape architecture]] program at [[Harvard University]], and Pei was thus introduced to members of the faculty at Harvard's [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design]] (GSD). He was excited by the lively atmosphere and joined the GSD in {{Nowrap|December 1942}}.<ref>Wiseman, p. 39; Boehm, pp. 36\\u201337.</ref>\\n\\nLess than a month later, Pei suspended his work at Harvard to join the [[National Defense Research Committee]], which coordinated scientific research into U.S. weapons technology during [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Pei's background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: \\\"If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy.\\\"<ref>Quoted in von Boehm, p. 42; a slightly different wording appears in Wiseman, p. 39: \\\"If you know how to build a building, you know how to destroy it.\\\"</ref> The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the [[Pacific War]]. The U.S. realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on [[incendiary device|incendiary bombs]]. Pei spent two and a half years with the NDRC, but revealed few details of his work.<ref>Boehm, p. 42.</ref>\\n\\nIn 1945, Eileen gave birth to a son, T'ing Chung, and she withdrew from the landscape architecture program in order to care for him. Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design. The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy. At the center were members of the [[Bauhaus]], a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design. The [[Nazi regime]] had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of them, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]], took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 41\\u201343; Boehm, pp. 37\\u201340.</ref>\\n\\nOne of Pei's design projects at the GSD was a plan for an art museum in Shanghai. He wanted to create a mood of Chinese authenticity in the architecture without using traditional materials or styles.<ref name=\\\"qw44\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p., 44.</ref> The design was based on straight modernist structures, organized around a central courtyard garden, with other similar natural settings arranged nearby. It was very well received, with Gropius calling it \\\"the best thing done in [my] master class.\\\"<ref name=\\\"qw44\\\" /> Pei received his [[Master of Architecture|MArch]] degree in 1946, and taught at Harvard for another two years.<ref name=\\\"Pei Cobb Freed & Partner\\\" /><ref>Wiseman, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n== Career ==\\n=== 1948\\u20131956: early career with Webb and Knapp ===\\nIn the spring of 1948, Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]] to join a staff of architects for his firm of [[Webb and Knapp]] to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 48\\u201349.</ref>\\n\\nHis first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building, which received funding from the [[Housing Act of 1949]]. Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation, and the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never progressed beyond the model stage.<ref>Wiseman, p. 51.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:131 Ponce de Leon Ave., Atlanta - I.M. Pei building.JPG|thumb|left|Pei's first project (1949): [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue]], Atlanta]]\\n\\nPei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf-p.com/a/f/fme/imp/p/p.html|title=I. M. Pei|website=pcf-p.com}}</ref> when he designed a two-story [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue|corporate building for Gulf Oil]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front fa\\u00e7ade was retained as part of an apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] brought praise from the journal ''Architectural Forum''.<ref>Wiseman, p. 52.</ref> Pei's designs echoed the work of [[Mies van der Rohe]] in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in [[Katonah, New York]] in 1952. Soon, Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including [[Henry N. Cobb]] and [[Ulrich Franzen]]. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the [[Roosevelt Field (Shopping Mall)|Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall]] on [[Long Island]]. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with [[teak]] walls and a glass [[clerestory]]. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 53\\u201354.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:L'Enfant Plaza - IMG 1926.JPG|thumb|right|Pei wanted the open spaces and buildings of [[L'Enfant Plaza]] to be \\\"functionally and visually related\\\" to one another.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 61.</ref>]]\\n\\nIn 1952, Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than 25 percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 57\\u201358.</ref> One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography: \\\"I learned the process of development, and about the city as a living organism.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vb52\\\">Boehm, p. 52.</ref> These lessons, he said, became essential for later projects.<ref name=\\\"vb52\\\" />\\n\\nPei and his team also designed a united urban area for Washington, D.C., called [[L'Enfant Plaza]] (named for French-American architect [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]).<ref name=\\\"PeiLenfant\\\">Williams, 2005, p. 120; Moeller and Weeks, 2006, p. 59.</ref> Pei's associate [[Araldo Cossutta]] was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building and South Building.<ref name=\\\"PeiLenfant\\\" /> [[Vlastimil Koubek]] was the architect for the East Building ([[L'Enfant Plaza Hotel]]), and for the Center Building (now the [[United States Postal Service]] headquarters).<ref name=\\\"PeiLenfant\\\" /> The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Washington Star]]'' (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 60\\u201362.</ref>\\n\\nIn 1955, Pei's group took a step toward institutional independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed [[architectural model]]s. They took on the [[Kips Bay]] residential area on the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], where Pei set up [[Kips Bay Towers]], two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of cement to check for consistency of color.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 62\\u201364.</ref>\\n\\nThe company continued its urban focus with the [[Society Hill]] project in central [[Philadelphia]]. Pei designed the [[Society Hill Towers]], a three-building residential block injecting cubist design into the local 18th-century milieu. As with previous projects, abundant green spaces were central to Pei's vision, which added traditional [[townhouse]]s to aid the transition from classical to modern design.<ref>Boehm, p. 51.</ref>\\n\\nFrom 1958 to 1963, Pei and [[Ray Affleck]] developed a key downtown block of [[Montreal]] in a phased process that involved one of Pei's most admired structures in the Commonwealth, the cruciform tower known as the Royal Bank Plaza ([[Place Ville Marie]]). According to ''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' : {{blockquote|its grand plaza and lower office buildings, designed by internationally famous US architect I. M. Pei, helped to set new standards for architecture in Canada in the 1960s ... The tower's smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate Pei's adherence to the mainstream of 20th-century modern design.<ref>The Canadian Encyclopedia online version</ref>}}\\n\\nAlthough those projects were satisfying, Pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself. In 1959, he was approached by MIT to design a building for its [[Earth science]] program. The [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] continued the grid design of Kips Bay and Society Hill. The pedestrian walkway on the ground floor, however, was prone to sudden gusts of wind, which embarrassed Pei. \\\"Here I was from MIT,\\\" he said, \\\"and I didn't know about [[wind-tunnel]] effects.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 67.</ref> At the same time, he co-designed the [[Luce Memorial Chapel]] at [[Tunghai University]] in [[Taichung]], Taiwan<!-- DO NOT LINK, see [[MOS:GEOLINK]] for further guidance -->. The soaring structure, commissioned by the same organization that had run his middle school in Shanghai, broke severely from the cubist grid patterns of his urban projects.<ref>Wiseman, p. 67.</ref><ref>Wiseman, pp. 66\\u201368.</ref>\\n\\nThe challenge of coordinating those projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising the plans for them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. \\\"Design is something you have to put your hand to,\\\" he said. \\\"While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, I had to keep track of the whole enterprise.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 69.</ref> Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.&nbsp;M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 69\\u201371.</ref>\\n\\n=== NCAR and related projects ===\\n[[File:National Center for Atmospheric Research - Boulder, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A series of brown boxlike buildings stand in front of a mountain.|Pei said he wanted the [[Mesa Laboratory]] of the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] to look \\\"as if it were carved out of the mountain\\\".<ref name=\\\"vb60\\\">Boehm, p. 60.</ref>]]\\n\\nPei was able to return to hands-on design when he was approached in 1961 by [[Walter Orr Roberts]] to design the new [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work because it rested in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. He drove around the region with his wife, visiting assorted buildings and surveying the natural environs. He was impressed by the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in Colorado Springs, but felt it was \\\"detached from nature\\\".<ref>Boehm, p. 59.</ref>\\n\\nThe conceptualization stages were important for Pei, presenting a need and an opportunity to break from the Bauhaus tradition. He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: \\\"I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy\\u2014the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again\\u2014just as my mother had taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vb60\\\" /> Pei also drew inspiration from the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde]] cliff dwellings of the [[Ancestral Puebloans]]; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 75\\u201376.</ref> To this end, he called for a rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.<ref>Wiseman, p. 80.</ref>\\n\\nRoberts disliked Pei's initial designs, referring to them as \\\"just a bunch of towers\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 79.</ref> Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique, but Pei was frustrated. His second attempt, however, fitted Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels. The complex used many elements of [[cubism|cubist]] design, and the walkways were arranged to increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 73, 86, and 90; Boehm, p. 61.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Palm court 1995.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A grid of palm trees arranged in a tiled courtyard stands to the right of a dormitory building.|As with NCAR, Pei combined elements of cubism and natural harmony when designing the dormitories at [[New College of Florida]] in the mid-1960s.<ref>Wiseman, p. 94.</ref>]]\\n\\nOnce the laboratory was built, several problems with its construction became apparent. Leaks in the roof caused difficulties for researchers, and the shifting of clay soil beneath the building caused cracks which were expensive to repair. Still, both architect and project manager were pleased with the final result. Pei referred to the NCAR complex as his \\\"breakout building\\\", and he remained a friend of Roberts until the scientist died in {{Nowrap|March 1990}}.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 91 and 74.</ref>\\n\\nThe success of NCAR brought renewed attention to Pei's design acumen. He was recruited to work on a variety of projects, including the [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]] at [[Syracuse University]], the [[Everson Museum of Art]] in [[Syracuse, New York]], the [[Sundrome]] terminal at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York City, and dormitories at [[New College of Florida]].<ref>[http://www.ncf.edu/about-us/history History]. 2009. New College of Florida.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|John F. Kennedy Library]] \\\"the most important commission\\\" in his life.<ref name=\\\"vb56\\\">Boehm, p. 56.</ref>]]\\n\\nAfter President [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] in {{Nowrap|November 1963}}, his family and friends discussed constructing a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 96\\u201398.</ref> Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. \\\"He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,\\\" she said. \\\"He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 98.</ref> Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it \\\"really an emotional decision\\\", she explained: \\\"He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 99.</ref>\\n\\nThe project was plagued with problems from the outset. President Kennedy had begun considering the structure of his library soon after taking office, and he wanted to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 95 and 100.</ref>\\n\\nPei's first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant to represent the optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the United States. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], the first proposed site for the building, as soon as the project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby [[Harvard Square]]. By the mid-1970s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 102\\u2013113.</ref> These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. \\\"I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door at the end of the day,\\\" she said. \\\"His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.&nbsp;M. to see that so many people didn't want the building.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 113.</ref>\\n\\nFinally the project moved to [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]], near the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. The new site was less than ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's architectural team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 115\\u2013116.</ref>\\n\\nThe [[John F. Kennedy Library|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]] was dedicated on October 20, 1979.<ref>{{Cite web |title=I.M.

The plan called for the demolition of hundreds of old downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens. It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s. The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development. Significant public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures. As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan|Metropolitan Area Projects]] (MAPS) initiative in 1993.<ref>[http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ \\\"Pei Plan and Pei Model History\\\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109035740/http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ |date=November 9, 2010 }} IM Pei Oklahoma City.

In 1964 the acting mayor of Dallas, [[J. Erik Jonsson|Erik Jonsson]], began working to change the community's image. Dallas was known and disliked as the city where the president had been killed, but Jonsson began a program designed to initiate a community renewal. One of the goals was a new city hall, which could be a \\\"symbol of the people\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 123.</ref> Jonsson, a co-founder of [[Texas Instruments]], learned about Pei from his associate [[Cecil Howard Green]], who had recruited the architect for MIT's [[Green Building (MIT)|Earth Sciences building]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 121\\u2013123.</ref>\\n\\nPei's approach to the new [[Dallas City Hall]] mirrored those of other projects; he surveyed the surrounding area and worked to make the building fit. In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents of the city and was impressed by their civic pride. He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector. He spoke of creating \\\"a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises\\\".<ref>Wiseman, p. 125.</ref>\\n\\nWorking with his associate Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design centered on a building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees, which shades the building from the Texas sun. A plaza stretches out before the building, and a series of support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's [[Government of Chandigarh|High Court building in Chandigarh]], India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify the building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years to complete. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 127\\u2013135.</ref>\\n\\nThe city of Dallas received the building well, and a local television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially opened to the public in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: \\\"It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse.\\\"<ref name=\\\"w136\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 136.</ref> He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 136\\u2013137.</ref>\\n\\n=== Hancock Tower, Boston ===\\n[[File:Plylwood palace.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two dark buildings rise into the early evening sky. The tower on the right is spotted with plywood on its side.|The disastrous failure of windows on the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] required replacing them with plywood; some called it \\\"the world's tallest wood building\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 149.</ref>]]\\n\\nWhile Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate [[Henry N. Cobb|Henry Cobb]] had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. [[John Hancock Insurance]] chairman Robert Slater hired I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the [[Prudential Tower]], erected by [[Prudential Insurance|their rival]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 140 and 145.</ref>\\n\\nAfter the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the [[Trinity Church (Boston)|Trinity Church]] and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a \\\"background and foil\\\" to the older structures around it.<ref>Wiseman, p. 147.</ref> When the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in [[New England]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 145.</ref>\\n[[File:Johnson-museum-of-art-cornell.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Herbert F. Johnson Museum at Cornell University|[[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art]], Cornell University]]\\nSerious issues of execution became evident in the tower almost immediately. Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. The entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels, significantly increasing costs. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were \\\"not good and workmanlike\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 150.</ref> LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I.&nbsp;M.

Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in Australia and Pei took on jobs in Singapore, [[Iran]], and [[Kuwait]]. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. \\\"Going through this trial toughened us,\\\" he said. \\\"It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 153.</ref>\\n\\n=== National Gallery East Building, Washington, DC ===\\n\\n[[File:National Gallery East Wing by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A large gray building rises above a stone plaza. Short square towers appear on either side of the building, and an array of irregular glass pyramids are in the middle of the plaza.|''Time'' magazine headlined its review of Pei's design for the East Building \\\"Masterpiece on the Mall\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 181.</ref>]]\\n\\nIn the mid-1960s, directors of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., declared the need for a new building. [[Paul Mellon]], a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant [[J. Carter Brown]] (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the [[Library of Alexandria]]. After inspecting Pei's work at the [[Des Moines Art Center]] in Iowa and the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art|Johnson Museum]] at [[Cornell University]], they offered him the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 155\\u2013161.</ref>\\n\\nPei took to the project with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had recently recruited to the firm, [[William Pedersen (architect)|William Pedersen]] and [[Yann Weymouth]]. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a [[trapezoid]] of land at the intersection of [[Constitution Avenue|Constitution]] and [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenues]]. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: \\\"No compromises.\\\"<ref>Wiseman, pp. 164\\u2013165.</ref>\\n\\nThe growing popularity of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, Pei designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights. Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room. A large [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile sculpture]] by American artist [[Alexander Calder]] was later added to the lobby.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 179\\u2013180.</ref> Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting to the public in the same way as the central room of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] is in New York City. The modern museum, he said later, \\\"must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young\\\".<ref>Boehm, p. 65.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Nga fg04.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large open cement room contains several people on the ground far below a balcony.

To match the look and texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick blocks and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the bottom and lighter blocks on top.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 177\\u2013178.</ref>\\n\\nThe East Building was honored on May 30, 1978, two days before its public unveiling, with a black-tie party attended by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Pei's building was \\\"a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture\\\".<ref name=\\\"w182\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 182.</ref> The sharp angle of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become stained and worn from the hands of visitors.<ref>Boehm, p. 68.</ref>\\n\\nSome critics disliked the unusual design, however, and criticized the reliance on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for ''[[Artforum]]'', critic Richard Hennessy described a \\\"shocking fun-house atmosphere\\\" and \\\"aura of ancient Roman patronage\\\".<ref name=\\\"w182\\\" /> One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. [[Allan Greenberg]] had scorned the design when it was first unveiled, but wrote later to [[J. Carter Brown]]: \\\"I am forced to admit that you are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 183.</ref>\\n<!--\\nStarting in 2005, the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk of panels falling off the building onto the public below.  In 2008 officials decided that it would be necessary to remove and reinstall ''all'' the panels.  The project was scheduled for completion in 2013.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=An Ultramodern Building Shows Signs of Age | first=Catesby | last=Leigh | date=December 8, 2009}}</ref>\\n-->\\n\\n=== Fragrant Hills, China ===\\nAfter U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] made his famous [[1972 Nixon visit to China|1972 visit to China]], a wave of exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a delegation of the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series of lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.<ref>Wiseman, p. 189.</ref>\\n[[File:Fragrant Hill Hotel.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A white building with ornamented windows faces a lake ringed with rock structures. Trees appear around the structure.|Pei was surprised by public resistance to his traditional design of the hotel at [[Fragrant Hills]] in China. \\\"Many people thought I was being reactionary,\\\" he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 193.</ref>]]\\nIn 1978, Pei was asked to initiate a project for his home country. After surveying a number of different locations, Pei fell in love with a valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as [[Fragrant Hills]]. The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to tear it down and build a new one. As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose. Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting. Thus, he said, it was necessary to find \\\"a third way\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 192; Wiseman, pp. 189\\u201392.</ref>\\n\\nAfter visiting his ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration of the relationship between enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favor with government officials and architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 192\\u2013193.</ref>\\n\\nThe hotel, with 325 guest rooms and a four-story central atrium, was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat. The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible. He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country. Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting {{convert|230|ST|t}} of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic. An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 201\\u2013203.</ref>\\n\\nDuring construction, a series of mistakes collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders. Whereas 200&nbsp;or so workers might have been used for a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000&nbsp;workers. This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used elsewhere. The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials. He later explained that his actions included \\\"shouting and pounding the table\\\" in frustration.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 205.</ref> The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting. As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work. He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors. The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 204\\u2013205.</ref>\\n\\nThe Fragrant Hill Hotel opened on October 17, 1982, but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff returned for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 206.</ref> The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered on the work of American [[postmodern architecture|postmodernists]] such as [[Michael Graves]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 206\\u2013207.</ref>\\n\\n=== Javits Convention Center, New York ===\\n[[File:Javits Center 11av jeh.JPG|thumb|alt=A building of dark tinted glass stands over a city street. The corners of the building are smoothed at 45-degree angles.|Pei said of the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]]: \\\"The complications exceeded even my expectations.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 211.</ref>]]\\n\\nAs the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei began work on the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] in New York City, for which his associate [[James Ingo Freed|James Freed]] served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in what was then a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate [[space frame]] of interconnected metal rods and spheres.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 211\\u2013216.</ref>\\n\\nThe convention center was plagued from the start by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes to be used in the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects: 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 222\\u2013224.</ref> The Javits Center opened on April 3, 1986, to a generally positive reception.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gottlieb |first=Martin |date=1986-04-04 |title=Javits Center Bustles on Opening Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/04/nyregion/javits-center-bustles-on-opening-day.html |access-date=2023-12-01 |website=The New York Times |language=en-US}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Grand Louvre, Paris ===\\n{{main|Grand Louvre}}\\n[[File:Paris 75001 Cour Napol\\u00e9on Louvre Aile Turgot 02a.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A classical building with ornamental design rises above a small crowd.

One of these was the renovation of the [[Louvre]]. Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named {{ill|\\u00c9mile Biasini|fr}} to oversee it. After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the U.S. National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team. The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there.<ref>Wiseman, p. 233; Boehm, p. 77.</ref> Pei finally agreed that a new construction project was not only possible, but necessary for the future of the museum. He thus became the first foreign architect to work on the Louvre.<ref>Wiseman, p. 234.</ref>\\n\\nThe heart of the new design included not only a renovation of the [[Cour Napol\\u00e9on]] in the midst of the buildings, but also a transformation of the interiors. Pei proposed a central entrance, not unlike the lobby of the National Gallery East Building, which would link the three major wings around the central space. Below would be a complex of additional floors for research, storage, and maintenance purposes. At the center of the courtyard he designed a [[Louvre Pyramid|glass and steel pyramid]], first proposed with the Kennedy Library, to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight. It was mirrored by an [[Pyramide Invers\\u00e9e|inverted pyramid]] to the west, to reflect sunlight into the complex. These designs were partly an homage to the fastidious geometry of the French landscape architect [[Andr\\u00e9 Le N\\u00f4tre]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 235\\u2013236.</ref> Pei also found the pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency, and considered it \\\"most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre, especially with the faceted planes of its roofs\\\".<ref name=\\\"Boehm, p. 84\\\" />\\n\\nBiasini and Mitterrand liked the plans, but the scope of the renovation displeased Louvre administrator Andr\\u00e9 Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was \\\"unfeasible\\\" and posed \\\"architectural risks\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 240.</ref> Some sections of the French public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 249\\u2013250.</ref> One critic called it a \\\"gigantic, ruinous gadget\\\";<ref name=\\\"w249\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 249.</ref> another charged Mitterrand with \\\"despotism\\\" for inflicting Paris with the \\\"atrocity\\\".<ref name=\\\"w249\\\" /> Pei estimated that 90&nbsp;percent of Parisians opposed his design. \\\"I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris,\\\" he said.<ref>Boehm, p. 80.</ref> Some condemnations carried [[nationalism|nationalistic]] overtones. One opponent wrote: \\\"I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 250.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Louvre Museum Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A gray pyramid sits in the center of a courtyard, surrounded by ancient buildings.|Pei decided that a pyramid was \\\"most compatible\\\" with the other structures at the Louvre, complementing their roofs' faceted planes.<ref name=\\\"Boehm, p. 84\\\" />]]\\nSoon, however, Pei and his team won the support of several key cultural icons, including the conductor [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Claude Pompidou]], widow of former French President [[Georges Pompidou]], after whom the similarly controversial [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris [[Jacques Chirac]] and placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000&nbsp;people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 251\\u2013252.</ref>\\n\\nPei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes. The pyramid was constructed at the same time as the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages. As they worked, construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25,000&nbsp;historical items; these were incorporated into the rest of the structure to add a new exhibition zone.<ref>Wiseman, p. 257.</ref>\\n\\nThe new [[Cour Napol\\u00e9on]] was opened to the public on October 14, 1988, and the Pyramid entrance was opened the following March. By this time, public opposition had softened; a poll found a 56 percent approval rating for the pyramid, with 23 percent still opposed. The newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' had vehemently criticized Pei's design, but later celebrated the tenth anniversary of its magazine supplement at the pyramid.<ref name=\\\"w255\\\">Wiseman, pp. 255\\u2013259.</ref> [[Charles III of the United Kingdom|Prince Charles]] of Britain surveyed the new site with curiosity, and declared it \\\"marvelous, very exciting\\\".<ref name=\\\"w259\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 259.</ref> A writer in ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]'' wrote: \\\"The much-feared pyramid has become adorable.\\\"<ref name=\\\"w259\\\" />\\n\\nThe experience was exhausting for Pei, but also rewarding. \\\"After the Louvre,\\\" he said later, \\\"I thought no project would be too difficult.\\\"<ref>Boehm, p. 90.</ref>  The pyramid achieved further widespread international recognition for its central role in the plot at the denouement of ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' by [[Dan Brown]] and its appearance in the final scene of the subsequent [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|screen adaptation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/routes/da-vinci-code|title=Visitor trails : The Da Vinci Code: Between Fiction and Fact \\u2013 Louvre Museum \\u2013 Paris|website=louvre.fr}}</ref> The ''[[Louvre Pyramid]]'' became Pei's most famous structure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Francis|author2=Jarxombek, Mark|others=Prakash, Vikramaditya|title=A Global History of Architecture|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc|location=New Jersey|year=2007|page=[https://archive.org/details/globalhistoryofa0000chin/page/742 742]|isbn=978-0-471-26892-5|url=https://archive.org/details/globalhistoryofa0000chin/page/742}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Meyerson Symphony Center, Dallas ===\\nThe opening of the Louvre Pyramid coincided with four other projects on which Pei had been working, prompting architecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] to declare 1989 \\\"the year of Pei\\\" in ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/17/arts/architecture-view-a-year-of-years-for-the-high-priest-of-modernism.html?pagewanted=all|title=Architecture View; A Year of Years for the High Priest of Modernism|work=The New York Times |author-link=Paul Goldberger|first=Paul|last=Goldberger|date=September 17, 1989|access-date=January 4, 2010}}</ref> It was also the year in which Pei's firm changed its name to [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]], to reflect the increasing stature and prominence of his associates. At the age of 72, Pei had begun thinking about retirement, but continued working long hours to see his designs come to light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 263\\u2013264.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Dallas Meyerson Center 02.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A beige cube rises at an angle around a half-cone made of glass and steel. In front, a square archway overlooks a stone courtyard.|Although he usually designed entirely by hand, Pei used a computer to \\\"confirm the spaces\\\" for the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]] in [[Dallas]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 272.</ref>]]\\nOne of the projects took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]]. The success of city's performing artists, particularly the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] then led by conductor [[Eduardo Mata]], led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in Europe. The organizing committee contacted 45&nbsp;architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that his work on the Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression. One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee. He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission. As one member put it: \\\"We were convinced that we would get the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 267.</ref>\\n\\nBecause its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on [[acoustics]] first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a [[Shoebox style (architecture)|shoebox]] auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the [[Concertgebouw, Amsterdam|Amsterdam Concertgebouw]] and [[Musikverein|Vienna Musikverein]]. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect [[Johann Balthasar Neumann]], especially the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]]. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Op\\u00e9ra]] designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 269\\u2013270.</ref>\\n\\nPei's design placed the rigid shoebox at an angle to the surrounding street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like [[filigree]]. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. \\\"I can imagine only 60&nbsp;percent of the space in this building,\\\" he said during the early stages. \\\"The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 272.</ref> As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon [[Ross Perot]] made a donation of US$10&nbsp;million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 273\\u2013274.</ref>\\n\\nThe building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending a week of performances in the hall, a music critic for ''The New York Times'' wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was \\\"a very mature building\\\"; he smiled and replied: \\\"Ah, but did I have to wait this long?\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 286.</ref>\\n\\n=== Bank of China, Hong Kong ===\\n\\nA new offer had arrived for Pei from the Chinese government in 1982. With an eye toward the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the [[Bank of China]]. The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hills, he agreed to accept the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 286\\u2013287.</ref>\\n\\nThe proposed site in Hong Kong's [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]] was less than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World War&nbsp;II, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in [[Katonah, New York|Katonah]], New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 287\\u2013288.</ref>\\n\\nPei felt that his design for the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] needed to reflect \\\"the aspirations of the Chinese people\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 288.</ref>  The design that he developed for the skyscraper was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The building is composed of four triangular shafts rising up from a square base, supported by a visible [[truss]] structure that distributes stress to the four corners of the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around  diagonal bracing in a union of structure and form that reiterates the triangle motif established in the plan. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of ''[[feng shui]]'' in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 289\\u2013291.</ref>\\n\\nAs the tower neared completion, Pei was shocked to witness the government's massacre of unarmed civilians at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. He wrote an opinion piece for ''The New York Times'' titled \\\"China Won't Ever Be the Same\\\", in which he said that the killings \\\"tore the heart out of a generation that carries the hope for the future of the country\\\".<ref name=\\\"WQ294\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 294.</ref> The massacre deeply disturbed his entire family, and he wrote that \\\"China is besmirched.\\\"<ref name=\\\"WQ294\\\" />\\n\\n=== 1990\\u20132019: museum projects ===\\n[[File:Cleveland August 2015 47 (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A gray tiled building rises over a lake, with a cylinder set on a narrow pole, and a sloping glass wall on one end.|One staff member sympathized with Pei's frustrations with the lack of organization at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], admitting that he was \\\"operating in a vacuum\\\".<ref name=\\\"WQ307\\\" />]]\\n\\nAs the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm. The staff had begun to shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set to work on his last major project as active partner: the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of [[high culture]] as the Louvre and U.S. National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to [[low culture]]. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. Pei accepted the commission in part because of the unique challenge it presented.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 303\\u2013306.</ref>\\n\\nUsing a glass wall for the entrance, similar in appearance to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated the exterior of the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space. The combination of off-centered wraparounds and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide \\\"a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 306.</ref>\\n\\nThe building opened in 1995, and was received with moderate praise. ''The New York Times'' called it \\\"a fine building\\\", but Pei was among those who felt disappointed with the results. The museum's early beginnings in New York combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed.<ref name=\\\"WQ307\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 307.</ref> Although the city of Cleveland benefited greatly from the new tourist attraction, Pei was unhappy with it.<ref name=\\\"WQ307\\\" />\\n\\nAt the same time, Pei designed a new museum for [[Luxembourg]], the ''Mus\\u00e9e d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean'', commonly known as the [[Mudam]]. Drawing from the original shape of the [[Fort Th\\u00fcngen]] walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 311\\u2013313.</ref>\\n\\nIn 1995, Pei was hired to design an extension to the ''[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]'', or German Historical Museum in Berlin. Returning to the challenge of the East Building of the U.S. National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a [[Modernism|modernist]] approach with a classical main structure. He described the glass cylinder addition as a \\\"beacon\\\",<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 315.</ref> and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics. \\\"They thought I was nothing but trouble\\\", he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 316.</ref>\\n\\nPei also worked at this time on two projects for a [[Japanese new religions|new Japanese religious movement]] called ''[[Shinji Shumeikai]]''. He was approached by the movement's spiritual leader, Kaishu Koyama, who impressed the architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom. One of the buildings was a bell tower, designed to resemble the ''[[bachi]]'' used when playing traditional instruments like the ''[[shamisen]]''. Pei was unfamiliar with the movement's beliefs, but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in the tower. As he said: \\\"It was a search for the sort of expression that is not at all technical.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 300.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Miho museum02n3872.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A curving circular tunnel opens to reveal a building with a tall sloping roof and a circular window in the front door.|Pei's tunnel through a mountain leading to the [[Miho Museum]] was partly inspired by a story from fourth-century Chinese poet [[Tao Yuanming]].<ref>Boehm, pp. 99\\u2013100.</ref>]]\\nThe experience was rewarding for Pei, and he agreed immediately to work with the group again. The new project was the [[Miho Museum]], to display Koyama's collection of [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] artifacts. Pei visited the site in [[Shiga Prefecture]], and during their conversations convinced Koyama to expand her collection. She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300&nbsp;items showcasing the history of the [[Silk Road]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 317\\u2013319.</ref>\\n\\nOne major challenge was the approach to the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80&nbsp;percent of the building underground.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 318\\u2013320.</ref>\\n\\nWhen designing the exterior, Pei borrowed from the tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby [[Kyoto]]. He created a concise [[Space frame|spaceframe]] wrapped into French limestone and covered with a glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old ''[[Zelkova serrata|keyaki]]'' tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350&nbsp;million.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 320\\u2013322.</ref>\\n\\nDuring the first decade of the 2000s, Pei designed a variety of buildings, including the [[Suzhou Museum]] near his childhood home.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/arts/design/09pei.html |title=I.

Although it was originally planned for the [[corniche]] road along [[Doha Bay]], Pei convinced the project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in [[Cairo]].\\n\\nOnce again, Pei sought to combine new design elements with the classical aesthetic most appropriate for the location of the building. The sand-colored rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior. Inside, galleries are arranged around a massive atrium, lit from above. The museum's coordinators were pleased with the project; its official website describes its \\\"true splendour unveiled in the sunlight,\\\" and speaks of \\\"the shades of colour and the interplay of shadows paying tribute to the essence of Islamic architecture\\\".<ref name=\\\"mia\\\">[http://www.mia.org.qa/en/about/the-museum-building \\\"The Architect: Introduction\\\"].

Born in [[Kingston upon Hull]], in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], he trained at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], but his studies\\u2014and the early stages of his career\\u2014were curtailed by the [[Second World War]]. After his [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilisation]] he returned to acting and found success, initially in [[revue]] and [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] productions.\\n\\nIn 1955 Carmichael was noticed by the film producers [[Boulting brothers|John and Roy Boulting]], who cast him in five of their films as one of the major players. The first was the 1956 film ''[[Private's Progress]]'', a satire on the [[British Army]]; he received critical and popular praise for the role, including from the American market. In many of his roles he played a likeable, often accident-prone, innocent. In the mid-1960s he played [[Bertie Wooster]] in adaptations of the works of [[P. G. Wodehouse]] in ''[[The World of Wooster]]'' for [[BBC Television]], for which he received mostly positive reviews, including from Wodehouse. In the early 1970s he played another [[upper-class]] literary character, [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], the amateur but talented investigator created by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]].\\n\\nMuch of Carmichael's success came through a disciplined approach to training and rehearsing for a role. He learned much about the craft and technique of humour while appearing with the comic actor [[Leo Franklyn]].

''The Times''}} A different reviewer pointed out one drawback of the 44-year-old Carmichael's performance: \\\"If we have thought of Bertie Wooster as eternally 22, not far in time from enjoyably wasted university days, Mr. Ian Carmichael opposes our view with a Bertie who is older but hopefully fixed in an inescapable mental youth.\\\"{{sfn|\\\"A Jeeves to Fit the Picture\\\". ''The Times''}} The best review, as far as Carmichael and the producer [[Michael Mills (British producer)|Michael Mills]] were concerned, was from Wodehouse, who sent a telegram to the BBC:\\n\\n<blockquote>To the producer and cast of the Jeeves sketches.<br>\\nThank you all for the perfectly wonderful performances.

There were two series\\u2014one in 1970, one the following year\\u2014and a total of 22 episodes; he negotiated a salary of \\u00a31,500 per episode, making him the best-paid actor at the BBC.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|pp=214, 220\\u2013223}}{{efn|According to calculations based on the [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation, \\u00a31,500 in 1970 is approximately \\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|1500|1970|cursign=\\u00a3|fmt=c|r=-1}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}, according to calculations based on [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{sfn|Clark|2023}}}} The media historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] thought that the programme, \\\"although ostensibly a middle-of-the-road family sitcom of no great ambition, came over as a polished and professional piece of work that pleased audiences over two extended series\\\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1998|p=53}}\\n\\nCarmichael was one of the driving forces behind the BBC's decision to adapt [[Dorothy L.

Born in Guangzhou into a Chinese family, Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the garden villas at Suzhou, the traditional retreat of the scholar-gentry to which his family belonged. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's architecture school, but quickly transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Unhappy with the focus on Beaux-Arts architecture at both schools, he spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially Le Corbusier.\\nAfter graduating, he joined the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) and befriended the Bauhaus architects Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. In 1948, Pei was recruited by New York City real estate magnate William Zeckendorf, for whom he worked for seven years before establishing an independent design firm, I. M. Pei & Associates, in 1955. In 1966, that became I. M. Pei & Partners, and  became Pei Cobb Freed & Partners in 1989. Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990. In his retirement, he worked as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons' architectural firm Pei Partnership Architects.\\nPei's first major recognition came with the Mesa Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the John F. Kennedy Library in Massachusetts. He went on to design Dallas City Hall and the East Building of the National Gallery of Art. He returned to China for the first time in 1975 to design a hotel at Fragrant Hills and, fifteen years later, designed Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong. In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy when he designed a glass-and-steel pyramid for the Louvre in Paris. He designed the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, the Miho Museum in Japan, Shigaraki, near Kyoto, and the chapel of the junior and high school: MIHO Institute of Aesthetics, the Suzhou Museum in Suzhou, Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar, and the Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art in Luxembourg.\\nPei won prizes and awards in the field of architecture, including the AIA Gold Medal in 1979, the first Praemium Imperiale for Architecture in 1989, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in 2003. In 1983, he won the Pritzker Prize, which is sometimes referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.\\n\\n\\n== Childhood ==\\n\\nI. M. Pei's ancestry traces back to the Ming dynasty, when his family moved from Anhui to Suzhou. The family made their wealth in medicinal herbs, then joined the ranks of the scholar-gentry. Pei Ieoh Ming was born on April 26, 1917, to Tsuyee and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to Hong Kong one year later. It eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist, who was recognized for her skills as a flautist. She invited him, but not his brothers or sisters, to join her on meditation retreats. His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.\\nPei's ancestors' success meant that the family lived in the upper echelons of society, but Pei said his father was \\\"not cultivated in the ways of the arts\\\". The younger Pei, drawn more to music and other cultural forms than to his father's domain of banking, explored art on his own. \\\"I have cultivated myself,\\\" he said later.\\nPei studied in St. Paul's College in Hong Kong as a child. When Pei was 10, his father received a promotion and relocated with his family to Shanghai. Pei attended St. John's Middle School, the secondary school of St. John's University that was run by Anglican missionaries. Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing billiards and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. He also learned rudimentary English by reading the Bible and novels by Charles Dickens.\\n\\nShanghai's many international elements gave it the name \\\"Paris of the East\\\". The city's global architectural flavors had a profound influence on Pei, from The Bund waterfront area to the Park Hotel, built in 1934. He was also impressed by the many gardens of Suzhou, where he spent the summers with extended family and regularly visited a nearby ancestral shrine. The Shizilin Garden, built in the 14th century by a Buddhist monk and owned by Pei's uncle Bei Runsheng, was especially influential. He spoke later of his fondness for the garden's blending of natural and human-built structures.\\nSoon after the move to Shanghai, Pei's mother developed cancer. She was prescribed opium for pain and assigned the task of preparing her pipe to Pei. She died shortly after his thirteenth birthday, and he was profoundly upset. The children were sent to live with extended family, as their father became more consumed by his work. Pei said: \\\"My father began living his own separate life pretty soon after that.\\\"  His father later married a woman named Aileen, who moved to New York later in her life.\\n\\n\\n== Education and formative years ==\\nAs Pei neared the end of his secondary education, he decided to attend university. He was accepted by a number of schools, but enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of Bing Crosby, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. \\\"College life in the U.S. seemed to me to be mostly fun and games\\\", he said in 2000. \\\"Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it ... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me.\\\" Pei added that \\\"Crosby's films in particular had a tremendous influence on my choosing the United States instead of England to pursue my education.\\\"\\nIn 1935, Pei boarded a boat and sailed to San Francisco, then traveled by train to Philadelphia. What he found once he arrived differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the Beaux-Arts style, rooted in the classical traditions of ancient Greece and Rome. Pei was more intrigued by modern architecture, and also felt intimidated by the high level of drafting proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.\\nMIT's architecture faculty was also focused on the Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work. In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. Pei was inspired by the innovative designs of the new International Style, characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in November 1935, an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: \\\"The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education.\\\" Pei was also influenced by the work of U.S. architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1938 he drove to Spring Green, Wisconsin, to visit Wright's famous Taliesin building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.\\nAlthough he disliked the Beaux-Arts emphasis, Pei excelled in his studies. \\\"I certainly don't regret the time at MIT\\\", he said later. \\\"There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture.\\\" Pei received his BArch degree in 1940; his thesis was titled \\\"Standardized Propaganda Units for War Time and Peace Time China\\\".\\nWhile visiting New York City in the late 1930s, Pei met a Wellesley College student named Eileen Loo. They began dating and married in the spring of 1942. She enrolled in the landscape architecture program at Harvard University, and Pei was thus introduced to members of the faculty at Harvard's Graduate School of Design (GSD). He was excited by the lively atmosphere and joined the GSD in December 1942.\\nLess than a month later, Pei suspended his work at Harvard to join the National Defense Research Committee, which coordinated scientific research into U.S. weapons technology during World War II. Pei's background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: \\\"If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy.\\\" The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the Pacific War. The U.S. realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on incendiary bombs. Pei spent two and a half years with the NDRC, but revealed few details of his work.\\nIn 1945, Eileen gave birth to a son, T'ing Chung, and she withdrew from the landscape architecture program in order to care for him. Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design. The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy. At the center were members of the Bauhaus, a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design. The Nazi regime had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of them, Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.\\nOne of Pei's design projects at the GSD was a plan for an art museum in Shanghai. He wanted to create a mood of Chinese authenticity in the architecture without using traditional materials or styles. The design was based on straight modernist structures, organized around a central courtyard garden, with other similar natural settings arranged nearby. It was very well received, with Gropius calling it \\\"the best thing done in [my] master class.\\\" Pei received his MArch degree in 1946, and taught at Harvard for another two years.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1948\\u20131956: early career with Webb and Knapp ===\\nIn the spring of 1948, Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate William Zeckendorf to join a staff of architects for his firm of Webb and Knapp to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.\\nHis first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building, which received funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation, and the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never progressed beyond the model stage.\\n\\nPei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949, when he designed a two-story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front fa\\u00e7ade was retained as part of an apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior curtain wall brought praise from the journal Architectural Forum. Pei's designs echoed the work of Mies van der Rohe in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah, New York in 1952. Soon, Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including Henry N. Cobb and Ulrich Franzen. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall on Long Island. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.\\n\\nIn 1952, Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in Denver, Colorado. The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than 25 percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas. One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography: \\\"I learned the process of development, and about the city as a living organism.\\\" These lessons, he said, became essential for later projects.\\nPei and his team also designed a united urban area for Washington, D.C., called L'Enfant Plaza (named for French-American architect Pierre Charles L'Enfant). Pei's associate Araldo Cossutta was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building and South Building. Vlastimil Koubek was the architect for the East Building (L'Enfant Plaza Hotel), and for the Center Building (now the United States Postal Service headquarters). The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both The Washington Post and Washington Star (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale.\\nIn 1955, Pei's group took a step toward institutional independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I. M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I. M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area on the East Side of Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of cement to check for consistency of color.\\nThe company continued its urban focus with the Society Hill project in central Philadelphia. Pei designed the Society Hill Towers, a three-building residential block injecting cubist design into the local 18th-century milieu. As with previous projects, abundant green spaces were central to Pei's vision, which added traditional townhouses to aid the transition from classical to modern design.\\n\\nFrom 1958 to 1963, Pei and Ray Affleck developed a key downtown block of Montreal in a phased process that involved one of Pei's most admired structures in the Commonwealth, the cruciform tower known as the Royal Bank Plaza (Place Ville Marie). According to The Canadian Encyclopedia : its grand plaza and lower office buildings, designed by internationally famous US architect I. M. Pei, helped to set new standards for architecture in Canada in the 1960s ... The tower's smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate Pei's adherence to the mainstream of 20th-century modern design.\\nAlthough those projects were satisfying, Pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself. In 1959, he was approached by MIT to design a building for its Earth science program. The Green Building continued the grid design of Kips Bay and Society Hill. The pedestrian walkway on the ground floor, however, was prone to sudden gusts of wind, which embarrassed Pei. \\\"Here I was from MIT,\\\" he said, \\\"and I didn't know about wind-tunnel effects.\\\" At the same time, he co-designed the Luce Memorial Chapel at Tunghai University in Taichung, Taiwan. The soaring structure, commissioned by the same organization that had run his middle school in Shanghai, broke severely from the cubist grid patterns of his urban projects.\\nThe challenge of coordinating those projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising the plans for them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. \\\"Design is something you have to put your hand to,\\\" he said. \\\"While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, I had to keep track of the whole enterprise.\\\" Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I. M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.\\n\\n\\n=== NCAR and related projects ===\\n\\nPei was able to return to hands-on design when he was approached in 1961 by Walter Orr Roberts to design the new Mesa Laboratory for the National Center for Atmospheric Research outside Boulder, Colorado. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work because it rested in an open area in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. He drove around the region with his wife, visiting assorted buildings and surveying the natural environs. He was impressed by the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, but felt it was \\\"detached from nature\\\".\\nThe conceptualization stages were important for Pei, presenting a need and an opportunity to break from the Bauhaus tradition. He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: \\\"I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy\\u2014the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again\\u2014just as my mother had taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me.\\\" Pei also drew inspiration from the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings of the Ancestral Puebloans; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings. To this end, he called for a rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.\\nRoberts disliked Pei's initial designs, referring to them as \\\"just a bunch of towers\\\". Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique, but Pei was frustrated. His second attempt, however, fitted Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels. The complex used many elements of cubist design, and the walkways were arranged to increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues.\\n\\nOnce the laboratory was built, several problems with its construction became apparent. Leaks in the roof caused difficulties for researchers, and the shifting of clay soil beneath the building caused cracks which were expensive to repair. Still, both architect and project manager were pleased with the final result. Pei referred to the NCAR complex as his \\\"breakout building\\\", and he remained a friend of Roberts until the scientist died in March 1990.\\nThe success of NCAR brought renewed attention to Pei's design acumen. He was recruited to work on a variety of projects, including the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York, the Sundrome terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, and dormitories at New College of Florida.\\n\\n\\n=== Kennedy Library ===\\n\\nAfter President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, his family and friends discussed constructing a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. \\\"He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,\\\" she said. \\\"He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.\\\" Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it \\\"really an emotional decision\\\", she explained: \\\"He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.\\\"\\nThe project was plagued with problems from the outset. President Kennedy had begun considering the structure of his library soon after taking office, and he wanted to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.\\nPei's first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant to represent the optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the United States. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the first proposed site for the building, as soon as the project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-1970s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. \\\"I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door at the end of the day,\\\" she said. \\\"His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I. M. to see that so many people didn't want the building.\\\"\\nFinally the project moved to Columbia Point, near the University of Massachusetts Boston. The new site was less than ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's architectural team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.\\nThe John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum was dedicated on October 20, 1979. Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. \\\"I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,\\\" he said in 2000. \\\"It could and should have been a great project.\\\" Pei's work on the Kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note.\\n\\n\\n=== \\\"Pei Plan\\\" in Oklahoma City ===\\n\\nThe Pei Plan was a failed urban redevelopment initiative designed for downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1964. The plan called for the demolition of hundreds of old downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens. It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s. The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development. Significant public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures. As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS) initiative in 1993.\\n\\n\\n=== Providence's Cathedral Square ===\\n\\nAnother city which turned to Pei for urban renewal during this time was Providence, Rhode Island. In the late 1960s, Providence hired Pei to redesign Cathedral Square, a once-bustling civic center which had become neglected and empty, as part of an ambitious larger plan to redesign downtown. Pei's new plaza, modeled after the Greek Agora marketplace, opened in 1972. The city ran out of money before Pei's vision could be fully realized. Also, recent construction of a low-income housing complex and Interstate 95 had changed the neighborhood's character permanently. In 1974, The Providence Evening Bulletin called Pei's new plaza a \\\"conspicuous failure\\\". By 2016, media reports characterized the plaza as a neglected, little-visited \\\"hidden gem\\\".\\n\\n\\n=== Augusta, Georgia ===\\n\\nIn 1974, the city of Augusta, Georgia turned to Pei and his firm for downtown revitalization. The Chamber of Commerce building and Bicentennial Park were completed from his plan. In 1976, Pei designed a distinctive modern penthouse that was added to the roof of architect William Lee Stoddart's historic Lamar Building, designed in 1916.  In 1980, Pei and his company designed the Augusta Civic Center, now known as the James Brown Arena.\\n\\n\\n=== Dallas City Hall ===\\n\\nKennedy's assassination also led indirectly to another commission for Pei's firm. In 1964 the acting mayor of Dallas, Erik Jonsson, began working to change the community's image. Dallas was known and disliked as the city where the president had been killed, but Jonsson began a program designed to initiate a community renewal. One of the goals was a new city hall, which could be a \\\"symbol of the people\\\". Jonsson, a co-founder of Texas Instruments, learned about Pei from his associate Cecil Howard Green, who had recruited the architect for MIT's Earth Sciences building.\\nPei's approach to the new Dallas City Hall mirrored those of other projects; he surveyed the surrounding area and worked to make the building fit. In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents of the city and was impressed by their civic pride. He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector. He spoke of creating \\\"a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises\\\".\\nWorking with his associate Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design centered on a building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees, which shades the building from the Texas sun. A plaza stretches out before the building, and a series of support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's High Court building in Chandigarh, India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify the building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years to complete. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.\\nThe city of Dallas received the building well, and a local television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially opened to the public in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: \\\"It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse.\\\" He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.\\n\\n\\n=== Hancock Tower, Boston ===\\n\\nWhile Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate Henry Cobb had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. John Hancock Insurance chairman Robert Slater hired I. M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the Prudential Tower, erected by their rival.\\nAfter the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the Trinity Church and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a \\\"background and foil\\\" to the older structures around it. When the Hancock Tower was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in New England.\\n\\nSerious issues of execution became evident in the tower almost immediately. Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. The entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels, significantly increasing costs. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I. M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were \\\"not good and workmanlike\\\". LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I. M. Pei & Partners sued LOF in return. All three companies settled out of court in 1981.\\nThe project became an albatross for Pei's firm. Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in Australia and Pei took on jobs in Singapore, Iran, and Kuwait. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. \\\"Going through this trial toughened us,\\\" he said. \\\"It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== National Gallery East Building, Washington, DC ===\\n\\nIn the mid-1960s, directors of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., declared the need for a new building. Paul Mellon, a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant J. Carter Brown (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the Library of Alexandria. After inspecting Pei's work at the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa and the Johnson Museum at Cornell University, they offered him the commission.\\nPei took to the project with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had recently recruited to the firm, William Pedersen and Yann Weymouth. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a trapezoid of land at the intersection of Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: \\\"No compromises.\\\"\\nThe growing popularity of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, Pei designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights. Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room. A large mobile sculpture by American artist Alexander Calder was later added to the lobby. Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting to the public in the same way as the central room of the Guggenheim Museum is in New York City. The modern museum, he said later, \\\"must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young\\\".\\n\\nMaterials for the building's exterior were chosen with careful precision. To match the look and texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick blocks and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the bottom and lighter blocks on top.\\nThe East Building was honored on May 30, 1978, two days before its public unveiling, with a black-tie party attended by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. Ada Louise Huxtable wrote in The New York Times that Pei's building was \\\"a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture\\\". The sharp angle of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become stained and worn from the hands of visitors.\\nSome critics disliked the unusual design, however, and criticized the reliance on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for Artforum, critic Richard Hennessy described a \\\"shocking fun-house atmosphere\\\" and \\\"aura of ancient Roman patronage\\\". One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. Allan Greenberg had scorned the design when it was first unveiled, but wrote later to J. Carter Brown: \\\"I am forced to admit that you are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Fragrant Hills, China ===\\nAfter U.S. President Richard Nixon made his famous 1972 visit to China, a wave of exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a delegation of the American Institute of Architects in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series of lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.\\n\\nIn 1978, Pei was asked to initiate a project for his home country. After surveying a number of different locations, Pei fell in love with a valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as Fragrant Hills. The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to tear it down and build a new one. As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose. Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting. Thus, he said, it was necessary to find \\\"a third way\\\".\\nAfter visiting his ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration of the relationship between enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favor with government officials and architects.\\nThe hotel, with 325 guest rooms and a four-story central atrium, was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat. The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible. He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country. Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting 230 short tons (210 t) of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic. An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project.\\nDuring construction, a series of mistakes collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders. Whereas 200 or so workers might have been used for a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000 workers. This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used elsewhere. The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials. He later explained that his actions included \\\"shouting and pounding the table\\\" in frustration. The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting. As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work. He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors. The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family.\\nThe Fragrant Hill Hotel opened on October 17, 1982, but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff returned for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings. The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered on the work of American postmodernists such as Michael Graves.\\n\\n\\n=== Javits Convention Center, New York ===\\n\\nAs the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei began work on the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, for which his associate James Freed served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in what was then a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate space frame of interconnected metal rods and spheres.\\nThe convention center was plagued from the start by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes to be used in the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects: 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on April 3, 1986, to a generally positive reception.\\n\\n\\n=== Grand Louvre, Paris ===\\n\\nWhen Fran\\u00e7ois Mitterrand was elected President of France in 1981, he laid out an ambitious plan for a variety of construction projects. One of these was the renovation of the Louvre. Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named \\u00c9mile Biasini to oversee it. After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the U.S. National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team. The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there. Pei finally agreed that a new construction project was not only possible, but necessary for the future of the museum. He thus became the first foreign architect to work on the Louvre.\\nThe heart of the new design included not only a renovation of the Cour Napol\\u00e9on in the midst of the buildings, but also a transformation of the interiors. Pei proposed a central entrance, not unlike the lobby of the National Gallery East Building, which would link the three major wings around the central space. Below would be a complex of additional floors for research, storage, and maintenance purposes. At the center of the courtyard he designed a glass and steel pyramid, first proposed with the Kennedy Library, to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight. It was mirrored by an inverted pyramid to the west, to reflect sunlight into the complex. These designs were partly an homage to the fastidious geometry of the French landscape architect Andr\\u00e9 Le N\\u00f4tre. Pei also found the pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency, and considered it \\\"most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre, especially with the faceted planes of its roofs\\\".\\nBiasini and Mitterrand liked the plans, but the scope of the renovation displeased Louvre administrator Andr\\u00e9 Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was \\\"unfeasible\\\" and posed \\\"architectural risks\\\". Some sections of the French public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid. One critic called it a \\\"gigantic, ruinous gadget\\\"; another charged Mitterrand with \\\"despotism\\\" for inflicting Paris with the \\\"atrocity\\\". Pei estimated that 90 percent of Parisians opposed his design. \\\"I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris,\\\" he said. Some condemnations carried nationalistic overtones. One opponent wrote: \\\"I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France.\\\"\\n\\nSoon, however, Pei and his team won the support of several key cultural icons, including the conductor Pierre Boulez and Claude Pompidou, widow of former French President Georges Pompidou, after whom the similarly controversial Centre Georges Pompidou was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac and placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000 people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid.\\nPei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes. The pyramid was constructed at the same time as the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages. As they worked, construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25,000 historical items; these were incorporated into the rest of the structure to add a new exhibition zone.\\nThe new Cour Napol\\u00e9on was opened to the public on October 14, 1988, and the Pyramid entrance was opened the following March. By this time, public opposition had softened; a poll found a 56 percent approval rating for the pyramid, with 23 percent still opposed. The newspaper Le Figaro had vehemently criticized Pei's design, but later celebrated the tenth anniversary of its magazine supplement at the pyramid. Prince Charles of Britain surveyed the new site with curiosity, and declared it \\\"marvelous, very exciting\\\". A writer in Le Quotidien de Paris wrote: \\\"The much-feared pyramid has become adorable.\\\"\\nThe experience was exhausting for Pei, but also rewarding. \\\"After the Louvre,\\\" he said later, \\\"I thought no project would be too difficult.\\\"  The pyramid achieved further widespread international recognition for its central role in the plot at the denouement of The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown and its appearance in the final scene of the subsequent screen adaptation. The Louvre Pyramid became Pei's most famous structure.\\n\\n\\n=== Meyerson Symphony Center, Dallas ===\\nThe opening of the Louvre Pyramid coincided with four other projects on which Pei had been working, prompting architecture critic Paul Goldberger to declare 1989 \\\"the year of Pei\\\" in The New York Times. It was also the year in which Pei's firm changed its name to Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, to reflect the increasing stature and prominence of his associates. At the age of 72, Pei had begun thinking about retirement, but continued working long hours to see his designs come to light.\\n\\nOne of the projects took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center. The success of city's performing artists, particularly the Dallas Symphony Orchestra then led by conductor Eduardo Mata, led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in Europe. The organizing committee contacted 45 architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that his work on the Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression. One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee. He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission. As one member put it: \\\"We were convinced that we would get the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward.\\\"\\nBecause its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on acoustics first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a shoebox auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and Vienna Musikverein. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect Johann Balthasar Neumann, especially the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the Paris Op\\u00e9ra designed by Charles Garnier.\\nPei's design placed the rigid shoebox at an angle to the surrounding street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like filigree. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. \\\"I can imagine only 60 percent of the space in this building,\\\" he said during the early stages. \\\"The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else.\\\" As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon Ross Perot made a donation of US$10 million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.\\nThe building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending a week of performances in the hall, a music critic for The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was \\\"a very mature building\\\"; he smiled and replied: \\\"Ah, but did I have to wait this long?\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Bank of China, Hong Kong ===\\nA new offer had arrived for Pei from the Chinese government in 1982. With an eye toward the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hills, he agreed to accept the commission.\\nThe proposed site in Hong Kong's Central District was less than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World War II, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in Katonah, New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.\\nPei felt that his design for the Bank of China Tower needed to reflect \\\"the aspirations of the Chinese people\\\".  The design that he developed for the skyscraper was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The building is composed of four triangular shafts rising up from a square base, supported by a visible truss structure that distributes stress to the four corners of the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around  diagonal bracing in a union of structure and form that reiterates the triangle motif established in the plan. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.\\nAs the tower neared completion, Pei was shocked to witness the government's massacre of unarmed civilians at the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times titled \\\"China Won't Ever Be the Same\\\", in which he said that the killings \\\"tore the heart out of a generation that carries the hope for the future of the country\\\". The massacre deeply disturbed his entire family, and he wrote that \\\"China is besmirched.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== 1990\\u20132019: museum projects ===\\n\\nAs the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm. The staff had begun to shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set to work on his last major project as active partner: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and U.S. National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. Pei accepted the commission in part because of the unique challenge it presented.\\nUsing a glass wall for the entrance, similar in appearance to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated the exterior of the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space. The combination of off-centered wraparounds and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide \\\"a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about\\\".\\nThe building opened in 1995, and was received with moderate praise. The New York Times called it \\\"a fine building\\\", but Pei was among those who felt disappointed with the results. The museum's early beginnings in New York combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed. Although the city of Cleveland benefited greatly from the new tourist attraction, Pei was unhappy with it.\\nAt the same time, Pei designed a new museum for Luxembourg, the Mus\\u00e9e d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean, commonly known as the Mudam. Drawing from the original shape of the Fort Th\\u00fcngen walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.\\nIn 1995, Pei was hired to design an extension to the Deutsches Historisches Museum, or German Historical Museum in Berlin. Returning to the challenge of the East Building of the U.S. National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a modernist approach with a classical main structure. He described the glass cylinder addition as a \\\"beacon\\\", and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics. \\\"They thought I was nothing but trouble\\\", he said.\\nPei also worked at this time on two projects for a new Japanese religious movement called Shinji Shumeikai. He was approached by the movement's spiritual leader, Kaishu Koyama, who impressed the architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom. One of the buildings was a bell tower, designed to resemble the bachi used when playing traditional instruments like the shamisen. Pei was unfamiliar with the movement's beliefs, but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in the tower. As he said: \\\"It was a search for the sort of expression that is not at all technical.\\\"\\n\\nThe experience was rewarding for Pei, and he agreed immediately to work with the group again. The new project was the Miho Museum, to display Koyama's collection of tea ceremony artifacts. Pei visited the site in Shiga Prefecture, and during their conversations convinced Koyama to expand her collection. She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300 items showcasing the history of the Silk Road.\\nOne major challenge was the approach to the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80 percent of the building underground.\\nWhen designing the exterior, Pei borrowed from the tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby Kyoto. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone and covered with a glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old keyaki tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350 million.\\nDuring the first decade of the 2000s, Pei designed a variety of buildings, including the Suzhou Museum near his childhood home. He also designed the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar, at the request of the Al-Thani Family. Although it was originally planned for the corniche road along Doha Bay, Pei convinced the project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.\\nOnce again, Pei sought to combine new design elements with the classical aesthetic most appropriate for the location of the building. The sand-colored rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior. Inside, galleries are arranged around a massive atrium, lit from above. The museum's coordinators were pleased with the project; its official website describes its \\\"true splendour unveiled in the sunlight,\\\" and speaks of \\\"the shades of colour and the interplay of shadows paying tribute to the essence of Islamic architecture\\\".\\n\\nThe Macao Science Center in Macau was designed by Pei Partnership Architects in association with I. M. Pei. The project to build the science center was conceived in 2001 and construction started in 2006. The center was completed in 2009 and opened by the Chinese President Hu Jintao. The main part of the building is a distinctive conical shape with a spiral walkway and large atrium inside, similar to that of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Galleries lead off the walkway, mainly consisting of interactive exhibits aimed at science education. The building is in a prominent position by the sea and is now a Macau landmark.\\nPei's career ended with his death in May 2019, at 102 years of age.\\n\\n\\n== Style and method ==\\nPei's style was described as thoroughly modernist, with significant cubist themes. He was known for combining traditional architectural principles with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns\\u2014circles, squares, and triangles are common elements of his work in both plan and elevation. As one critic wrote: \\\"Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method.\\\" In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei \\\"the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice\\\". At the same time, Pei himself rejected simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: The talk about modernism versus post-modernism is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style in which it is going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community. How does it affect life?\\nPei's work is celebrated throughout the world of architecture. His colleague John Portman once told him: \\\"Just once, I'd like to do something like the East Building.\\\" But this originality did not always bring large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: \\\"Just once, I'd like to make the kind of money you do.\\\" His concepts, moreover, were too individualized and dependent on context to have given rise to a particular school of design. Pei referred to his own \\\"analytical approach\\\" when explaining the lack of a \\\"Pei School\\\".\\n\\\"For me,\\\" he said, \\\"the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose ... My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements ... to arrive at an ideal balance among them.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\nIn the words of his biographer, Pei won \\\"every award of any consequence in his art\\\", including the Arnold Brunner Award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1963), the Gold Medal for Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1979), the AIA Gold Medal (1979), the first Praemium Imperiale for Architecture from the Japan Art Association (1989), the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, the 1998 Edward MacDowell Medal in the Arts, and the 2010 Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1983 he was awarded the Pritzker Prize, sometimes referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture. In its citation, the jury said: \\\"Ieoh Ming Pei has given this century some of its most beautiful interior spaces and exterior forms ... His versatility and skill in the use of materials approach the level of poetry.\\\" The prize was accompanied by a US$100,000 award, which Pei used to create a scholarship for Chinese students to study architecture in the U.S., on the condition that they return to China to work. In 1986, he was one of twelve recipients of the Medal of Liberty. When he was awarded the 2003 Henry C. Turner Prize by the National Building Museum, museum board chair Carolyn Brody praised his impact on construction innovation: \\\"His magnificent designs have challenged engineers to devise innovative structural solutions, and his exacting expectations for construction quality have encouraged contractors to achieve high standards.\\\" In December 1992, Pei was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush. In 1996, Pei became the first person to be elected a foreign member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Pei was also an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nPei's wife, Eileen Loo, died on June 20, 2014. Together they had three sons, T'ing Chung (1945\\u20132003), Chien Chung (1946\\u20132023; known as Didi), and Li Chung (b. 1949; known as Sandi); and a daughter, Liane (b. 1960). T'ing Chung was an urban planner and alumnus of his father's alma mater MIT and Harvard. Chieng Chung and Li Chung, who are both Harvard Graduate School of Design alumni, founded and run Pei Partnership Architects. Liane is a lawyer.\\nIn 2015, Pei's home health aide, Eter Nikolaishvili, grabbed Pei's right forearm and twisted it, resulting in bruising and bleeding and hospital treatment. Pei alleged that the assault occurred when Pei threatened to call the police about Nikolaishvili. Nikolaishvili agreed to plead guilty in 2016.\\nPei celebrated his 100th birthday on April 26, 2017. He died at his Manhattan apartment on May 16, 2019, at the age of 102.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nIn the 2021 parody film America: The Motion Picture, I. M.

Born in Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, he trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but his studies\\u2014and the early stages of his career\\u2014were curtailed by the Second World War. After his demobilisation he returned to acting and found success, initially in revue and sketch productions.\\nIn 1955 Carmichael was noticed by the film producers John and Roy Boulting, who cast him in five of their films as one of the major players. The first was the 1956 film Private's Progress, a satire on the British Army; he received critical and popular praise for the role, including from the American market. In many of his roles he played a likeable, often accident-prone, innocent. In the mid-1960s he played Bertie Wooster in adaptations of the works of P. G. Wodehouse in The World of Wooster for BBC Television, for which he received mostly positive reviews, including from Wodehouse. In the early 1970s he played another upper-class literary character, Lord Peter Wimsey, the amateur but talented investigator created by Dorothy L. Sayers.\\nMuch of Carmichael's success came through a disciplined approach to training and rehearsing for a role. He learned much about the craft and technique of humour while appearing with the comic actor Leo Franklyn. Although Carmichael tired of being typecast as the affable but bumbling upper-class Englishman, his craft ensured that while audiences laughed at his antics, he retained their affection; Dennis Barker, in Carmichael's obituary in The Guardian, wrote that he \\\"could play fool parts in a way that did not cut the characters completely off from human sympathy: a certain dignity was always maintained\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\n\\nIan Gillett Carmichael was born on 18 June 1920 in Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He was the eldest child of Kate (n\\u00e9e Gillett) and her husband Arthur Denholm Carmichael, an optician on the premises of his family's firm of jewellers. Carmichael had two younger sisters, the twins Mary and Margaret, who were born in December 1923. Robert Fairclough, his biographer, describes Carmichael's upbringing as a \\\"privileged, pampered existence\\\"; his parents employed maids and a cook. His infant education included one term at the local Froebel House School when he was four, but this was curtailed after his parents were shocked at the \\\"alarmingly foul language he began bringing home\\\", according to Alex Jennings, Carmichael's biographer in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.\\nIn 1928 Carmichael was sent to Scarborough College, a prep school in North Yorkshire, which he attended between the ages of seven and thirteen. He did not like the spartan and authoritarian regime at the school. He described the discipline as \\\"Dickensian\\\", with corporal punishment used for even minor infringements of the rules; ablutions in the morning and evening were conducted with cold water\\u2014which often had a film of ice on the top during winter.\\nIn 1933 Carmichael left Scarborough College and entered Bromsgrove School, a public school in Worcestershire. He soon concluded that \\\"the new curriculum was not arduous\\\", which gave him the opportunity for focus on matters that were of more interest for him: acting, popular music and cricket. In the late 1930s Carmichael decided to go to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His parents would have preferred he went into the family jewellery business, but accepted their son's decision and supported him financially when he left Yorkshire for London in January 1939.\\n\\n\\n=== Early career and war service, 1939\\u20131946 ===\\n\\nCarmichael enjoyed his time at RADA, including the fact that women outnumbered men on his course, which he described as \\\"heady stuff\\\" after his boys-only boarding school. He remembered the time at RADA in the late 1930s fondly in his autobiography, describing it as:\\n\\nA period of unconfined joy, occasioned by my finally shaking off the shackles of school discipline and being able to mix daily with young men and young women who shared my interests and enthusiasms. This joy was, nevertheless, being tempered by the worsening European situation. The fear that now, just as I was standing on the threshold of a future that I had dreamed about for years, the whole thing might be snuffed out like a candle was too unbearable to contemplate.\\nDuring his second term Carmichael had his first professional acting role: as a robot in Karel \\u010capek's R.U.R. at the People's Palace theatre, in Mile End, East London. He recalled the experience as \\\"a dull play performed in a cold and uninspiring theatre and my particular contribution required absolutely no acting talent whatsoever\\\". He then appeared as Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream at RADA's Vanbrugh Theatre. The opening night was 1 September 1939, the day Hitler invaded Poland. After the play's second performance its run was ended, as RADA shut down in anticipation that war was about to be declared; the following day the UK joined the war. Carmichael returned to his familial home and completed the forms to join the Officer Cadet Reserve, hoping to be commissioned as an officer. He helped gather the harvest in a nearby farm until 2 October, when he was attested into the army; he was told he would have to wait until he was twenty\\u2014on 18 June 1940\\u2014before he started training.\\nAs the early months of the war were marked by limited military action, RADA reassessed its closure, and decided to reopen. Carmichael returned to London and shared lodgings with two fellow RADA students, Geoffrey Hibbert and Patrick Macnee; Carmichael and Macnee became lifelong friends. Between June and August 1940 Carmichael was on a ten-week tour of Nine Sharp, a revue developed by Herbert Farjeon. After the tour Carmichael reported for training on 12 September at Catterick Garrison. After ten weeks' basic training, he was posted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to become an officer cadet. He completed his training and passed out in March 1941 as a second lieutenant in the 22nd Dragoons, part of the Royal Armoured Corps.\\nAt the end of training manoeuvres in November 1941, near Whitby, North Yorkshire, Carmichael was struggling to close the hatch of his Valentine tank when it slammed down, cutting off the top of a finger on his left hand. The surgery was botched and caused him pain for several months; he had a second operation several months later. He described it as \\\"dashed unfortunate\\\" and \\\"my one and only war-wound, albeit a self-inflicted one\\\".\\nIn between training for the liberation of France Carmichael began producing revues and productions as part of his brigade's entertainment. On 16 June 1944, ten days after D-Day, Carmichael and his armoured reconnaissance troop landed in France. He fought through to Germany with the regiment and by the time of Victory in Europe Day in May 1945, he had been promoted to captain and mentioned in despatches.\\n\\nCarmichael's regiment was part of 30 Corps and an initial post-war challenge in Germany was the welfare of the occupying forces. The corps' commanding officer was Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks, who ordered a repertory company to be formed for entertainment. When Carmichael auditioned he recognised the major in charge of the unit as Richard Stone, an actor who had been a contemporary at RADA; Carmichael was taken into the company and assisted Stone with auditioning other members. One of the comedians who auditioned was Frankie Howerd, whom Carmichael thought \\\"very gauche ... too undisciplined and not very funny either. Very much the amateur\\\". Stone disagreed and signed the comic up to perform in a Royal Army Service Corps concert party. The corps' company was also joined by actors from Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA); Carmichael did not often appear on stage with them, but worked as the producer of twenty shows. In April 1946 Stone was promoted and was transferred to the UK; Carmichael was promoted to major and took control of the theatrical company. His leadership of the company was short-lived, as he was demobilised that July.\\n\\n\\n=== Early post-war career, 1946\\u20131955 ===\\nIn July 1946 Carmichael signed with Stone, who had also been demobilised and had set up as a theatrical agent. Carmichael obtained his first post-war role in the revue Between Ourselves in mid-1946 before he appeared in two small roles in the comedy She Wanted a Cream Front Door\\u2014 a hotel receptionist and a BBC reporter. The production went on a twelve-week tour round Britain from October 1946, and then ran at the Apollo Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, London, for four months.\\nBetween 1947 and 1951 Carmichael appeared on stage in both plays and revues \\u2014the latter often at the Players' Theatre in Villiers Street, Charing Cross. He made his debut appearance on BBC television in 1947 in New Faces, a revue that also included Zoe Gail, Bill Fraser and Charles Hawtrey. From 1948 he also began appearing in films, including Bond Street (1948), Trottie True and Dear Mr. Prohack (both 1949); these early roles were minor parts and he was uncredited. He spent much of 1949 in a thirty-week tour of Britain with the operetta The Lilac Domino. According to Jennings, Carmichael's \\\"first conspicuous success\\\" was The Lyric Revue in 1951; the production transferred to The Globe (now the Gielgud Theatre) as The Globe Revue in 1952. He received a positive review in the industry publication The Stage, which reported that he \\\"hits the bull's-eye\\\" for his comic performance in one sketch, \\\"Bank Holiday\\\", which involved him undressing on the beach under a mackintosh.\\nCarmichael spent the next three years appearing in stage revues and small roles in films. Although he enjoyed working in revues, he was concerned about being stuck in a career rut. In a 1954 interview in The Stage, he said \\\"I'm afraid that managers and directors may think of me only as a revue artist, and much as I enjoy acting in sketches I feel there must be a limit to the number of characters one is able to create. What I would like now is to be offered a part in light comedy or a farce\\\". Between November 1954 and May 1955 he appeared as David Prentice in the stage production of Simon and Laura alongside Roland Culver and Coral Browne at the Strand Theatre, London. The following year a film version was directed by Muriel Box; she asked Carmichael to repeat his role, while Browne and Culver's roles were taken by Kay Kendall and Peter Finch. The reviewer for The Times thought Carmichael \\\"comes near to stealing the film from both of them\\\". In 1955 Carmichael also appeared in The Colditz Story. He played Robin Cartwright, an officer in the Guards, and spent much of his screen time appearing with Richard Wattis; the two men provided an element of comic relief in the film, with what Fairclough describes as a \\\"Flanagan and Allen tribute act\\\". The Colditz Story was Carmichael's ninth film role and he had, Fairclough notes, risen to sixth in the credits behind John Mills and Eric Portman.\\n\\n\\n=== Screen success, 1955\\u20131962 ===\\n\\nIn 1955 Carmichael was contacted by the filmmaker twins the Boulting brothers. They wanted him to appear in two film versions of novels\\u2014Private's Progress by Alan Hackney and Brothers in Law by Henry Cecil\\u2014with an option for five films in all; the final contract was for a total of six films. The Boultings' first work with Carmichael was the 1956 film Private's Progress, a satire on the British Army. The film opened in February 1956 and starred Carmichael, Richard Attenborough, Dennis Price and Terry-Thomas. The film historian Alan Boulton observed \\\"Reviews were decidedly mixed and the critical response did not match the popular enthusiasm for the film\\\"; it was either the second or third most popular film at the British box office that year. Carmichael received praise for his role, however, including from The Manchester Guardian, which thought he \\\"fulfils his promise as a comedian\\\"; the reviewer for The Times thought Carmichael acted \\\"with an unfailing tact and sympathy\\u2014he even manages to make a drunken scene seem rich in comedy\\\". The film introduced American audiences to Carmichael, and his screen presence in the US was warmly received by reviewers. The reviewer Margaret Hinxman, writing in Picturegoer, considered that after Private's Progress Carmichael had become \\\"one of Britain's choicest screen exports\\\".\\nFrom June to September 1956 Carmichael was involved in the filming of Brothers in Law, which was directed by Roy Boulting; others in the cast included Attenborough and Terry-Thomas. When the film was released in March 1957 Carmichael received positive reviews, including from Philip Oakes, the reviewer from The Evening Standard, who concluded that Carmichael \\\"confirms his placing in my form book as our best light comedian\\\". The reviewer for The Manchester Guardian thought Carmichael was \\\"irrepressibly funny in his well-bred, well-intentioned, bewildered ineptitude\\\".\\n\\nIn September 1957 Carmichael appeared in a third Boulting brothers film, Lucky Jim in which he appeared alongside Terry-Thomas and Hugh Griffith in an adaptation of a 1954 novel by Kingsley Amis. Fairclough notes that while the film was not well received by the critics, Carmichael's performance received great praise. The Manchester Guardian considered that Carmichael, \\\"although in many ways excellent, has fewer chances than in Brothers-in-Law to delight us with those studies in agonised embarrassment in which he excels\\\", while The Daily Telegraph reviewer considered \\\"[Carmichael's] Jim, complete with North-Country accent and the ability to pull comic faces, might so easily have been the author's creation brought to life off the page.\\\"\\nCarmichael then appeared in a fourth film with the Boultings, Happy Is the Bride, a lightweight comedy of manners released in March 1958 which also included Janette Scott, Cecil Parker, Terry-Thomas and Joyce Grenfell. Carmichael spent much of the end of 1957 and most of 1958 on stage with The Tunnel of Love. The journalist R. B. Marriott described it as a \\\"slightly crazy, wonderfully ridiculous comedy\\\", and it had a five-week tour around the UK which preceded a run at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, between December 1957 and August 1958. During the run, in April 1958, Carmichael was interviewed for Desert Island Discs by Roy Plomley on the BBC Home Service.\\nCarmichael once again appeared as Stanley Windrush, the character he portrayed in Private's Progress, in his fifth film with the Boultings, I'm All Right Jack, which was released in August 1959. Several other actors from Private's Progress also reprised their roles: Price (as Bertram Tracepurcel); Attenborough (as Sidney De Vere Cox) and Terry-Thomas (as Major Hitchcock). A new character was introduced in the film, Peter Sellers as the trade union shop steward Fred Kite. The film was the highest-grossing at the British box office in 1960 and earned Sellers the award for Best British Actor at the 13th British Academy Film Awards. Although Sellers received most of the plaudits for the film, Carmichael was given good reviews for his role, with The Illustrated London News saying he was \\\"in excellent fooling\\\" and \\\"delicious both at work and at play\\\". In 1960 Carmichael appeared in School for Scoundrels, based on Stephen Potter's \\\"gamesmanship\\\" series of books.  Appearing alongside him were Terry-Thomas, Alastair Sim and Janette Scott. The reviews for the film were not positive, but the actors were praised for their work in it.\\nThe release of School for Scoundrels was Carmichael's tenth film in five years. Fairclough observes that during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Carmichael began to get a reputation among his colleagues as being difficult to work with. Eric Maschwitz, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment for Television, recorded in an internal memo that Carmichael had given \\\"great difficulty\\\" during negotiations, and concluded that \\\"his head seems to have been a little turned by his success\\\". Some actors had to point out to him that he was \\\"doing a Carmichael\\\" whenever he tried to improve his billing, or upstage his fellow actors, including Derek Nimmo in 1962, during the filming of The Amorous Prawn. Despite the criticism, Carmichael described the period as \\\"I think the happiest five or six years of my whole career\\\".\\nIn December 1961 Carmichael was appearing in the comedy mystery play The Gazebo every evening and filming Double Bunk during the day. The mental and physical toll on him was too much, and he collapsed in the middle of a performance. The show's producer, Harold Fielding, instructed Carmichael to take at least two week's holiday to rest, and he paid for Carmichael and his wife to have a holiday in Switzerland. He returned to the show on 23 December, but he lost his voice during the Boxing Day show and could only complete Act 1. He returned to the show after a few days, but left permanently on 28 January 1962 on his doctor's orders.\\n\\n\\n=== Wooster and Wimsey, 1962\\u20131979 ===\\n\\nTastes in film changed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with the new wave of British films moving away from plots centred on the upper classes and the establishment, to works such as Look Back in Anger, Room at the Top (both 1959), Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962), where working class drama came to the fore. One of the effects of the new movement was a downturn in the number of films that wanted a character like those normally played by Carmichael. He was still being offered some film roles, but all, he said, \\\"were variations on the same old bumbling, accident-prone clot\\\" with which he was becoming increasingly bored.\\nIn August 1964 the BBC approached Carmichael to discuss the possibility of his taking the role of Bertie Wooster\\u2014described by Fairclough as \\\"the misadventuring, 1920s upper-class loafer\\\"\\u2014for adaptations of the works of P. G. Wodehouse. He turned it down, as he had agreed to appear on Broadway, taking the lead in a production of the farce Boeing-Boeing. He appeared at the Cort Theatre in February 1965, but the run ended after 23 performances, as the farce was not to the taste of New York audiences. Carmichael was delighted by the early close, as he hated his time in the US and said \\\"I found New York a disturbing, violent city and I disliked it instantly\\\". As soon as he heard the production was to close, he sent a telegram to the BBC to note his availability to play Wooster. Carmichael negotiated a fee of 500 guineas (\\u00a3525) per half-hour episode, and assisted in finding the right person for Jeeves, eventually selecting Dennis Price.\\nThe first series of The World of Wooster received the Guild of Television Producers and Directors award for best comedy series production of 1965, and the programme ran for three series, broadcast between May 1965 and November 1967, comprising twenty episodes in total. Reviews for Carmichael were positive, with a reviewer in The Times declaring \\\"The World of Wooster is also a triumph of casting, for Ian Carmichael and Dennis Price are perfect impersonators of two characters who are by no means lay-figures ... They are a priceless pair.\\\" A different reviewer pointed out one drawback of the 44-year-old Carmichael's performance: \\\"If we have thought of Bertie Wooster as eternally 22, not far in time from enjoyably wasted university days, Mr. Ian Carmichael opposes our view with a Bertie who is older but hopefully fixed in an inescapable mental youth.\\\" The best review, as far as Carmichael and the producer Michael Mills were concerned, was from Wodehouse, who sent a telegram to the BBC:\\n\\nTo the producer and cast of the Jeeves sketches.\\nThank you all for the perfectly wonderful performances. I am simply delighted with it. Bertie and Jeeves are just as I have always imagined them, and every part is played just right.\\nBless you!\\n\\nP. G. Wodehouse\\nWodehouse later reconsidered his opinion and thought Carmichael overacted in the role. Only one of the episodes remains: the others were wiped to reuse the expensive videotape.\\nIn September 1970 Carmichael was the lead role in Bachelor Father, a sitcom loosely based on the true story of a single man who fostered twelve children. There were two series\\u2014one in 1970, one the following year\\u2014and a total of 22 episodes; he negotiated a salary of \\u00a31,500 per episode, making him the best-paid actor at the BBC. The media historian Mark Lewisohn thought that the programme, \\\"although ostensibly a middle-of-the-road family sitcom of no great ambition, came over as a polished and professional piece of work that pleased audiences over two extended series\\\".\\nCarmichael was one of the driving forces behind the BBC's decision to adapt Dorothy L. Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey stories for television. He first had the idea of appearing as Wimsey in 1966, but various factors\\u2014including financing, Carmichael's association with Bertie Wooster in the public's eye and difficulty obtaining the rights\\u2014delayed the project. By January 1971, however, they were able to start filming the first programme, Clouds of Witness, which was broadcast in 1972 in five parts. This was followed by The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, Murder Must Advertise, The Nine Tailors and  The Five Red Herrings between February 1973 and August 1975. Richard Last, writing in The Daily Telegraph thought Carmichael was \\\"an inspired piece of casting. ... he has exactly the right outward touch of aristocratic frivolity but more than the ability to suggest the steel underneath\\\". Clive James, reviewing for The Observer, described Carmichael as \\\"an extremely clever actor\\\", and thought he was \\\"turning in one of those thespian efforts which seem easy at the time but which in retrospect are found to have been the ideal embodiment of the written character\\\". Carmichael went on to play Wimsey on BBC Radio 4, recording nine adaptations with Peter Jones as Mervyn Bunter, Wimsey's valet.\\nIn 1979 Carmichael appeared in The Lady Vanishes, which starred Elliott Gould and Cybill Shepherd; the film was a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1938 film of the same name. Carmichael appeared as Caldicott alongside Arthur Lowe's character Charters, two cricket-obsessed English gentlemen; the roles were played in the original by Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford. The journalist Patrick Humphries, while describing the film as \\\"lamentable\\\", thought that only Carmichael and Lowe \\\"emerge with any credibility\\\". Carmichael was interviewed on Desert Island Discs for a second time in June 1979.\\n\\n\\n=== Semi-retirement, 1979\\u20132009 ===\\nIn 1979 Carmichael published his autobiography Will the Real Ian Carmichael ..., which marked what Fairclough calls his \\\"semi-retirement\\\" in Yorkshire. He continued to work periodically, including providing the voice for Rat in the 1983 film The Wind in the Willows and as the narrator for the television series of the same name between 1984 and 1990. He revisited the works of Wodehouse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, providing the voice of Galahad Threepwood for two radio productions, Pigs Have Wings and Galahad at Blandings.\\nIn 1992 and 1993 he played Sir James Menzies in two series of Strathblair, a BBC family drama set in 1950 broadcast on Sunday evenings. He undertook his last stage role in June 1995, playing Sir Peter Teazle in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The School for Scandal at the Chichester Festival Theatre. From 2003 he took his final role: that of T. J. Middleditch in the ITV hospital drama series The Royal. He continued filming with The Royal until 2009.\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\nIn late March 1941, when Carmichael's regiment was posted to Whitby he met \\\"Pym\\\"\\u2014Jean Pyman Maclean\\u2014who he described as \\\"blonde, just eighteen, five feet six, sensationally pretty and a beautiful dancer\\\"; he thought her personality was \\\"warm ... genuine. There was an innocence about her, an unsophistication that disarmed even the most worldly\\\". The couple became engaged in May 1942 and married on 6 October 1943; they had two daughters, Lee (born in 1946) and Sally (born in 1949). Pym died of cancer in 1983.\\nIn 1984 Carmichael recorded a series of short stories for the BBC; the programmes were produced by Kate Fenton. They began a relationship and she left the BBC in 1985 and moved in with him in the Esk Valley, near Whitby. They were married in July 1992. Carmichael enjoyed playing and watching cricket, and listed it as one of this interests in Who's Who. He was a member of the Lord's Taverners cricket charity from 1956 until October 1976, and would relax on film sets playing a casual game with other members of the cast and crew, a practice he was introduced to by the Boulting brothers. He was also a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club.\\nIn 2003 Carmichael was appointed OBE for services to drama. He died on 5 February 2010 of a pulmonary embolism.\\n\\n\\n== Screen persona and technique ==\\nCarmichael learned much of his technique from the thirty-week tour of The Lilac Domino he undertook in the late 1940s, where he appeared opposite the comic actor Leo Franklyn. Carmichael acknowledged the credit for his development as a light comic actor went \\\"in its entirety to the training, coaxing and encouragement of ... Franklyn\\\", who \\\"showed me how to time my laughs and how to play an audience\\\". Carmichael's experience in revue helped when he worked in a dramatic play; his experience in getting a character across to an audience quickly in a short sketch showed him that \\\"it is very important to establish a comedy character as soon as possible. Your whole performance may depend on this being done\\\".\\nCarmichael polished his performances through extensive rehearsals and training. The screenwriter Paul Dehn acknowledges the effort and discipline needed by Carmichael to achieve a polished feel to his act, describing how Carmichael would \\\"slave for hours to perfect one stumble on a stairway and, having got it, ... [would] make it seem effortless thereafter\\\". Jennings considers much of Carmichael's seemingly effortless light touch \\\"was built on a hugely disciplined and virtuosic technique\\\". Carmichael's choice of comedy was character-, rather than situation-based and when the film or play generated its atmosphere from normal, recognisable aspects of life. He selected his work projects carefully and became involved in the development and production side as closely as possible, or initiated the project himself.\\nThe image he portrayed in many of his works was summarised by one obituarist as \\\"the affable, archetypal silly ass Englishman\\\" with a \\\"wide-eyed boyish grin, bemused courtesy and hapless, trusting manner\\\". He became somewhat typecast with the character, but audiences liked him in the role, and \\\"he polished this persona with great care\\\", according to his obituarist in The Daily Telegraph, even though he tired of playing the role so often. One of the attractions for the public was that he played his parts to get the audience's sympathy for the character, but with a measure of dignity that viewers could relate to. During Carmichael's semi-retirement, the Boulting brothers told him that they had not shown the range of his talents, and that \\\"perhaps they should not virtually have confined him to the playing of twerps\\\". When he took the role of Wimsey\\u2014the intelligent, cultured and effective investigator\\u2014the critic Nancy Banks-Smith wrote that \\\"it was high time that Ian Carmichael was given the opportunity to look intelligent\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Notes and references ==\\n\\n\\n=== Notes ===\\n\\n\\n=== References ===\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nIan Carmichael at IMDb\\nIan Carmichael discography at Discogs\\nBBC Humber feature on Ian Carmichael\",\n          \"Wayne Township is a township that is located in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, United States.\\nThe population was 1,296 at the time of the 2020 census, an increase over the figure of 1,200 that was tabulated in 2010.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nWayne Township appears in the 1876 Atlas of Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.

Born in Guangzhou into a Chinese family, Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the garden villas at [[Suzhou]], the traditional retreat of the [[scholar-gentry]] to which his family belonged. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s architecture school, but quickly transferred to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Unhappy with the focus on [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] at both schools, he spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially [[Le Corbusier]].\\n\\nAfter graduating, he joined the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (GSD) and befriended the [[Bauhaus]] architects [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]]. In 1948, Pei was recruited by New York City real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]], for whom he worked for seven years before establishing an independent design firm, I. M. Pei & Associates, in 1955. In 1966, that became I. M. Pei & Partners, and  became [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] in 1989. Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990. In his retirement, he worked as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons' architectural firm [[Pei Partnership Architects]].\\n\\nPei's first major recognition came with the [[Mesa Laboratory]] at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] in Colorado (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] in Massachusetts. He went on to design [[Dallas City Hall]] and the [[National Gallery of Art#Architecture|East Building]] of the [[National Gallery of Art]].<ref name=\\\":0\\\">{{cite web |last1=Goldberger |first1=Paul |title=I.M.

He also learned rudimentary English by reading the Bible and novels by [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name=\\\"w3133\\\">Wiseman, pp. 31\\u201333.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Customs House and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Pedestrians walk before a row of trees and a series of tall buildings.

He was also impressed by the many gardens of Suzhou, where he spent the summers with extended family and regularly visited a nearby ancestral shrine. The [[Lion Grove Garden|Shizilin Garden]], built in the 14th century by a Buddhist monk and owned by Pei's uncle Bei Runsheng, was especially influential. He spoke later of his fondness for the garden's blending of natural and human-built structures.<ref name=\\\"vb18\\\" /><ref name=\\\"w3133\\\" />\\n\\nSoon after the move to Shanghai, Pei's mother developed cancer. She was prescribed [[opium]] for pain and assigned the task of preparing her pipe to Pei. She died shortly after his thirteenth birthday, and he was profoundly upset.<ref>Boehm, p. 25.</ref> The children were sent to live with extended family, as their father became more consumed by his work. Pei said: \\\"My father began living his own separate life pretty soon after that.\\\"<ref>Boehm, p. 26.</ref>  His father later married a woman named Aileen, who moved to New York later in her life.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gonzalez |first=David |date=1998-11-28 |title=About New York; A Chinese Oasis for the Soul on Staten Island |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/28/nyregion/about-new-york-a-chinese-oasis-for-the-soul-on-staten-island.html |access-date=2023-12-01 |website=The New York Times |language=en-US}}</ref>\\n\\n== Education and formative years ==\\nAs Pei neared the end of his secondary education, he decided to attend university. He was accepted by a number of schools, but enrolled at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 33\\u201334.</ref> Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him.<ref>Wiseman, p. 34.</ref> The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of [[Bing Crosby]], which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. \\\"College life in the U.S. seemed to me to be mostly fun and games\\\", he said in 2000. \\\"Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it&nbsp;... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me.\\\"<ref>Boehm, p. 34.</ref> Pei added that \\\"Crosby's films in particular had a tremendous influence on my choosing the United States instead of England to pursue my education.\\\"<ref>Boehm, pp. 33\\u201334.</ref>\\n\\nIn 1935, Pei boarded a boat and sailed to [[San Francisco]], then traveled by train to [[Philadelphia]]. What he found once he arrived differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]], rooted in the classical traditions of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]. Pei was more intrigued by [[modern architecture]], and also felt intimidated by the high level of [[architectural drawing|drafting]] proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.<ref>Wiseman, p. 35.</ref>\\n\\nMIT's architecture faculty was also focused on the Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work. In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect [[Le Corbusier]]. Pei was inspired by the innovative designs of the new [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in {{Nowrap|November 1935}}, an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: \\\"The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vb36\\\">Boehm, p. 36.</ref> Pei was also influenced by the work of U.S. architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. In 1938 he drove to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]<!-- DO NOT LINK SEPARATELY, see [[MOS:GEOLINK]] for further guidance -->, to visit Wright's famous [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.<ref name=\\\"wright\\\">Boehm, p. 36; Wiseman, p. 36.</ref>\\n\\nAlthough he disliked the Beaux-Arts emphasis, Pei excelled in his studies. \\\"I certainly don't regret the time at MIT\\\", he said later. \\\"There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vb40\\\">Boehm, p. 40.</ref> Pei received his [[Bachelor of Architecture|BArch]] degree in 1940; his thesis was titled \\\"Standardized Propaganda Units for War Time and Peace Time China\\\".<ref>Boehm, pp. 40\\u201341. Pei believed the term \\\"propaganda\\\" to be value-neutral; his advisers disapproved.</ref><ref name=\\\":1\\\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/renowned-architect-mit-alumnus-im-pei-dies-0517|title=Renowned architect I.M.

They began dating and married in the spring of 1942. She enrolled in the [[landscape architecture]] program at [[Harvard University]], and Pei was thus introduced to members of the faculty at Harvard's [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design]] (GSD). He was excited by the lively atmosphere and joined the GSD in {{Nowrap|December 1942}}.<ref>Wiseman, p. 39; Boehm, pp. 36\\u201337.</ref>\\n\\nLess than a month later, Pei suspended his work at Harvard to join the [[National Defense Research Committee]], which coordinated scientific research into U.S. weapons technology during [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Pei's background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: \\\"If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy.\\\"<ref>Quoted in von Boehm, p. 42; a slightly different wording appears in Wiseman, p. 39: \\\"If you know how to build a building, you know how to destroy it.\\\"</ref> The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the [[Pacific War]]. The U.S. realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on [[incendiary device|incendiary bombs]]. Pei spent two and a half years with the NDRC, but revealed few details of his work.<ref>Boehm, p. 42.</ref>\\n\\nIn 1945, Eileen gave birth to a son, T'ing Chung, and she withdrew from the landscape architecture program in order to care for him. Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design. The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy. At the center were members of the [[Bauhaus]], a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design. The [[Nazi regime]] had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of them, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]], took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 41\\u201343; Boehm, pp. 37\\u201340.</ref>\\n\\nOne of Pei's design projects at the GSD was a plan for an art museum in Shanghai. He wanted to create a mood of Chinese authenticity in the architecture without using traditional materials or styles.<ref name=\\\"qw44\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p., 44.</ref> The design was based on straight modernist structures, organized around a central courtyard garden, with other similar natural settings arranged nearby. It was very well received, with Gropius calling it \\\"the best thing done in [my] master class.\\\"<ref name=\\\"qw44\\\" /> Pei received his [[Master of Architecture|MArch]] degree in 1946, and taught at Harvard for another two years.<ref name=\\\"Pei Cobb Freed & Partner\\\" /><ref>Wiseman, p. 45.</ref>\\n\\n== Career ==\\n=== 1948\\u20131956: early career with Webb and Knapp ===\\nIn the spring of 1948, Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]] to join a staff of architects for his firm of [[Webb and Knapp]] to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 48\\u201349.</ref>\\n\\nHis first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building, which received funding from the [[Housing Act of 1949]]. Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation, and the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never progressed beyond the model stage.<ref>Wiseman, p. 51.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:131 Ponce de Leon Ave., Atlanta - I.M. Pei building.JPG|thumb|left|Pei's first project (1949): [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue]], Atlanta]]\\n\\nPei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf-p.com/a/f/fme/imp/p/p.html|title=I. M. Pei|website=pcf-p.com}}</ref> when he designed a two-story [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue|corporate building for Gulf Oil]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front fa\\u00e7ade was retained as part of an apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] brought praise from the journal ''Architectural Forum''.<ref>Wiseman, p. 52.</ref> Pei's designs echoed the work of [[Mies van der Rohe]] in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in [[Katonah, New York]] in 1952. Soon, Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including [[Henry N. Cobb]] and [[Ulrich Franzen]]. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the [[Roosevelt Field (Shopping Mall)|Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall]] on [[Long Island]]. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with [[teak]] walls and a glass [[clerestory]]. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 53\\u201354.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:L'Enfant Plaza - IMG 1926.JPG|thumb|right|Pei wanted the open spaces and buildings of [[L'Enfant Plaza]] to be \\\"functionally and visually related\\\" to one another.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 61.</ref>]]\\n\\nIn 1952, Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than 25 percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 57\\u201358.</ref> One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography: \\\"I learned the process of development, and about the city as a living organism.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vb52\\\">Boehm, p. 52.</ref> These lessons, he said, became essential for later projects.<ref name=\\\"vb52\\\" />\\n\\nPei and his team also designed a united urban area for Washington, D.C., called [[L'Enfant Plaza]] (named for French-American architect [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]).<ref name=\\\"PeiLenfant\\\">Williams, 2005, p. 120; Moeller and Weeks, 2006, p. 59.</ref> Pei's associate [[Araldo Cossutta]] was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building and South Building.<ref name=\\\"PeiLenfant\\\" /> [[Vlastimil Koubek]] was the architect for the East Building ([[L'Enfant Plaza Hotel]]), and for the Center Building (now the [[United States Postal Service]] headquarters).<ref name=\\\"PeiLenfant\\\" /> The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Washington Star]]'' (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 60\\u201362.</ref>\\n\\nIn 1955, Pei's group took a step toward institutional independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed [[architectural model]]s. They took on the [[Kips Bay]] residential area on the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], where Pei set up [[Kips Bay Towers]], two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of cement to check for consistency of color.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 62\\u201364.</ref>\\n\\nThe company continued its urban focus with the [[Society Hill]] project in central [[Philadelphia]]. Pei designed the [[Society Hill Towers]], a three-building residential block injecting cubist design into the local 18th-century milieu. As with previous projects, abundant green spaces were central to Pei's vision, which added traditional [[townhouse]]s to aid the transition from classical to modern design.<ref>Boehm, p. 51.</ref>\\n\\nFrom 1958 to 1963, Pei and [[Ray Affleck]] developed a key downtown block of [[Montreal]] in a phased process that involved one of Pei's most admired structures in the Commonwealth, the cruciform tower known as the Royal Bank Plaza ([[Place Ville Marie]]). According to ''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' : {{blockquote|its grand plaza and lower office buildings, designed by internationally famous US architect I. M. Pei, helped to set new standards for architecture in Canada in the 1960s ... The tower's smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate Pei's adherence to the mainstream of 20th-century modern design.<ref>The Canadian Encyclopedia online version</ref>}}\\n\\nAlthough those projects were satisfying, Pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself. In 1959, he was approached by MIT to design a building for its [[Earth science]] program. The [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] continued the grid design of Kips Bay and Society Hill. The pedestrian walkway on the ground floor, however, was prone to sudden gusts of wind, which embarrassed Pei. \\\"Here I was from MIT,\\\" he said, \\\"and I didn't know about [[wind-tunnel]] effects.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 67.</ref> At the same time, he co-designed the [[Luce Memorial Chapel]] at [[Tunghai University]] in [[Taichung]], Taiwan<!-- DO NOT LINK, see [[MOS:GEOLINK]] for further guidance -->. The soaring structure, commissioned by the same organization that had run his middle school in Shanghai, broke severely from the cubist grid patterns of his urban projects.<ref>Wiseman, p. 67.</ref><ref>Wiseman, pp. 66\\u201368.</ref>\\n\\nThe challenge of coordinating those projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising the plans for them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. \\\"Design is something you have to put your hand to,\\\" he said. \\\"While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, I had to keep track of the whole enterprise.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 69.</ref> Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.&nbsp;M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 69\\u201371.</ref>\\n\\n=== NCAR and related projects ===\\n[[File:National Center for Atmospheric Research - Boulder, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A series of brown boxlike buildings stand in front of a mountain.|Pei said he wanted the [[Mesa Laboratory]] of the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] to look \\\"as if it were carved out of the mountain\\\".<ref name=\\\"vb60\\\">Boehm, p. 60.</ref>]]\\n\\nPei was able to return to hands-on design when he was approached in 1961 by [[Walter Orr Roberts]] to design the new [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work because it rested in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. He drove around the region with his wife, visiting assorted buildings and surveying the natural environs. He was impressed by the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in Colorado Springs, but felt it was \\\"detached from nature\\\".<ref>Boehm, p. 59.</ref>\\n\\nThe conceptualization stages were important for Pei, presenting a need and an opportunity to break from the Bauhaus tradition. He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: \\\"I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy\\u2014the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again\\u2014just as my mother had taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vb60\\\" /> Pei also drew inspiration from the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde]] cliff dwellings of the [[Ancestral Puebloans]]; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 75\\u201376.</ref> To this end, he called for a rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.<ref>Wiseman, p. 80.</ref>\\n\\nRoberts disliked Pei's initial designs, referring to them as \\\"just a bunch of towers\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 79.</ref> Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique, but Pei was frustrated. His second attempt, however, fitted Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels. The complex used many elements of [[cubism|cubist]] design, and the walkways were arranged to increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 73, 86, and 90; Boehm, p. 61.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Palm court 1995.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A grid of palm trees arranged in a tiled courtyard stands to the right of a dormitory building.|As with NCAR, Pei combined elements of cubism and natural harmony when designing the dormitories at [[New College of Florida]] in the mid-1960s.<ref>Wiseman, p. 94.</ref>]]\\n\\nOnce the laboratory was built, several problems with its construction became apparent. Leaks in the roof caused difficulties for researchers, and the shifting of clay soil beneath the building caused cracks which were expensive to repair. Still, both architect and project manager were pleased with the final result. Pei referred to the NCAR complex as his \\\"breakout building\\\", and he remained a friend of Roberts until the scientist died in {{Nowrap|March 1990}}.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 91 and 74.</ref>\\n\\nThe success of NCAR brought renewed attention to Pei's design acumen. He was recruited to work on a variety of projects, including the [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]] at [[Syracuse University]], the [[Everson Museum of Art]] in [[Syracuse, New York]], the [[Sundrome]] terminal at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York City, and dormitories at [[New College of Florida]].<ref>[http://www.ncf.edu/about-us/history History]. 2009. New College of Florida. Retrieved November 12, 2009.</ref>\\n\\n=== Kennedy Library ===\\n[[File:JFK library Stitch Crop.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A white triangular tower rises beside a black glass building, with circular structures on either side.|Pei considered the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|John F. Kennedy Library]] \\\"the most important commission\\\" in his life.<ref name=\\\"vb56\\\">Boehm, p. 56.</ref>]]\\n\\nAfter President [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] in {{Nowrap|November 1963}}, his family and friends discussed constructing a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 96\\u201398.</ref> Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. \\\"He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,\\\" she said. \\\"He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 98.</ref> Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it \\\"really an emotional decision\\\", she explained: \\\"He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 99.</ref>\\n\\nThe project was plagued with problems from the outset. President Kennedy had begun considering the structure of his library soon after taking office, and he wanted to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 95 and 100.</ref>\\n\\nPei's first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant to represent the optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the United States. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], the first proposed site for the building, as soon as the project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby [[Harvard Square]]. By the mid-1970s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 102\\u2013113.</ref> These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. \\\"I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door at the end of the day,\\\" she said. \\\"His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.&nbsp;M. to see that so many people didn't want the building.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 113.</ref>\\n\\nFinally the project moved to [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]], near the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. The new site was less than ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's architectural team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 115\\u2013116.</ref>\\n\\nThe [[John F. Kennedy Library|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]] was dedicated on October 20, 1979.<ref>{{Cite web |title=I.M.

The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. \\\"I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,\\\" he said in 2000. \\\"It could and should have been a great project.\\\"<ref name=\\\"vb56\\\" /> Pei's work on the Kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note.<ref>Wiseman, p. 119.</ref>\\n\\n{{anchor|\\\"Pei Plan\\\" in Oklahoma City}}\\n\\n=== \\\"Pei Plan\\\" in Oklahoma City ===\\n{{Main|Pei Plan}}\\n\\nThe Pei Plan was a failed urban redevelopment initiative designed for downtown [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma, in 1964. The plan called for the demolition of hundreds of old downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens. It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s. The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development. Significant public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures. As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan|Metropolitan Area Projects]] (MAPS) initiative in 1993.<ref>[http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ \\\"Pei Plan and Pei Model History\\\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109035740/http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ |date=November 9, 2010 }} IM Pei Oklahoma City.

In 1964 the acting mayor of Dallas, [[J. Erik Jonsson|Erik Jonsson]], began working to change the community's image. Dallas was known and disliked as the city where the president had been killed, but Jonsson began a program designed to initiate a community renewal. One of the goals was a new city hall, which could be a \\\"symbol of the people\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 123.</ref> Jonsson, a co-founder of [[Texas Instruments]], learned about Pei from his associate [[Cecil Howard Green]], who had recruited the architect for MIT's [[Green Building (MIT)|Earth Sciences building]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 121\\u2013123.</ref>\\n\\nPei's approach to the new [[Dallas City Hall]] mirrored those of other projects; he surveyed the surrounding area and worked to make the building fit. In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents of the city and was impressed by their civic pride. He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector. He spoke of creating \\\"a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises\\\".<ref>Wiseman, p. 125.</ref>\\n\\nWorking with his associate Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design centered on a building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees, which shades the building from the Texas sun. A plaza stretches out before the building, and a series of support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's [[Government of Chandigarh|High Court building in Chandigarh]], India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify the building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years to complete. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 127\\u2013135.</ref>\\n\\nThe city of Dallas received the building well, and a local television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially opened to the public in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: \\\"It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse.\\\"<ref name=\\\"w136\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 136.</ref> He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 136\\u2013137.</ref>\\n\\n=== Hancock Tower, Boston ===\\n[[File:Plylwood palace.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two dark buildings rise into the early evening sky. The tower on the right is spotted with plywood on its side.|The disastrous failure of windows on the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] required replacing them with plywood; some called it \\\"the world's tallest wood building\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 149.</ref>]]\\n\\nWhile Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate [[Henry N. Cobb|Henry Cobb]] had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. [[John Hancock Insurance]] chairman Robert Slater hired I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the [[Prudential Tower]], erected by [[Prudential Insurance|their rival]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 140 and 145.</ref>\\n\\nAfter the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the [[Trinity Church (Boston)|Trinity Church]] and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a \\\"background and foil\\\" to the older structures around it.<ref>Wiseman, p. 147.</ref> When the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in [[New England]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 145.</ref>\\n[[File:Johnson-museum-of-art-cornell.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Herbert F. Johnson Museum at Cornell University|[[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art]], Cornell University]]\\nSerious issues of execution became evident in the tower almost immediately. Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. The entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels, significantly increasing costs. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were \\\"not good and workmanlike\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 150.</ref> LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners sued LOF in return. All three companies settled out of court in 1981.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 149\\u2013150.</ref>\\n\\nThe project became an [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] for Pei's firm. Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in Australia and Pei took on jobs in Singapore, [[Iran]], and [[Kuwait]]. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. \\\"Going through this trial toughened us,\\\" he said. \\\"It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 153.</ref>\\n\\n=== National Gallery East Building, Washington, DC ===\\n\\n[[File:National Gallery East Wing by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A large gray building rises above a stone plaza. Short square towers appear on either side of the building, and an array of irregular glass pyramids are in the middle of the plaza.|''Time'' magazine headlined its review of Pei's design for the East Building \\\"Masterpiece on the Mall\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 181.</ref>]]\\n\\nIn the mid-1960s, directors of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., declared the need for a new building. [[Paul Mellon]], a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant [[J. Carter Brown]] (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the [[Library of Alexandria]]. After inspecting Pei's work at the [[Des Moines Art Center]] in Iowa and the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art|Johnson Museum]] at [[Cornell University]], they offered him the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 155\\u2013161.</ref>\\n\\nPei took to the project with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had recently recruited to the firm, [[William Pedersen (architect)|William Pedersen]] and [[Yann Weymouth]]. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a [[trapezoid]] of land at the intersection of [[Constitution Avenue|Constitution]] and [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenues]]. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: \\\"No compromises.\\\"<ref>Wiseman, pp. 164\\u2013165.</ref>\\n\\nThe growing popularity of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, Pei designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights. Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room. A large [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile sculpture]] by American artist [[Alexander Calder]] was later added to the lobby.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 179\\u2013180.</ref> Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting to the public in the same way as the central room of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] is in New York City. The modern museum, he said later, \\\"must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young\\\".<ref>Boehm, p. 65.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Nga fg04.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large open cement room contains several people on the ground far below a balcony. Several trees are planted in the concrete floor, and an array of clear windows let in sunshine from above.|Critic Richard Hennessy complained in  ''[[Artforum]]'' about the East Building's \\\"shocking fun-house atmosphere\\\".<ref name=\\\"w182\\\" />]]\\n\\nMaterials for the building's exterior were chosen with careful precision. To match the look and texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick blocks and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the bottom and lighter blocks on top.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 177\\u2013178.</ref>\\n\\nThe East Building was honored on May 30, 1978, two days before its public unveiling, with a black-tie party attended by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Pei's building was \\\"a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture\\\".<ref name=\\\"w182\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 182.</ref> The sharp angle of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become stained and worn from the hands of visitors.<ref>Boehm, p. 68.</ref>\\n\\nSome critics disliked the unusual design, however, and criticized the reliance on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for ''[[Artforum]]'', critic Richard Hennessy described a \\\"shocking fun-house atmosphere\\\" and \\\"aura of ancient Roman patronage\\\".<ref name=\\\"w182\\\" /> One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. [[Allan Greenberg]] had scorned the design when it was first unveiled, but wrote later to [[J. Carter Brown]]: \\\"I am forced to admit that you are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 183.</ref>\\n<!--\\nStarting in 2005, the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk of panels falling off the building onto the public below.  In 2008 officials decided that it would be necessary to remove and reinstall ''all'' the panels.  The project was scheduled for completion in 2013.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=An Ultramodern Building Shows Signs of Age | first=Catesby | last=Leigh | date=December 8, 2009}}</ref>\\n-->\\n\\n=== Fragrant Hills, China ===\\nAfter U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] made his famous [[1972 Nixon visit to China|1972 visit to China]], a wave of exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a delegation of the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series of lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.<ref>Wiseman, p. 189.</ref>\\n[[File:Fragrant Hill Hotel.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A white building with ornamented windows faces a lake ringed with rock structures. Trees appear around the structure.|Pei was surprised by public resistance to his traditional design of the hotel at [[Fragrant Hills]] in China. \\\"Many people thought I was being reactionary,\\\" he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 193.</ref>]]\\nIn 1978, Pei was asked to initiate a project for his home country. After surveying a number of different locations, Pei fell in love with a valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as [[Fragrant Hills]]. The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to tear it down and build a new one. As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose. Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting. Thus, he said, it was necessary to find \\\"a third way\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 192; Wiseman, pp. 189\\u201392.</ref>\\n\\nAfter visiting his ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration of the relationship between enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favor with government officials and architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 192\\u2013193.</ref>\\n\\nThe hotel, with 325 guest rooms and a four-story central atrium, was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat. The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible. He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country. Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting {{convert|230|ST|t}} of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic. An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 201\\u2013203.</ref>\\n\\nDuring construction, a series of mistakes collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders. Whereas 200&nbsp;or so workers might have been used for a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000&nbsp;workers. This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used elsewhere. The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials. He later explained that his actions included \\\"shouting and pounding the table\\\" in frustration.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 205.</ref> The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting. As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work. He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors. The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 204\\u2013205.</ref>\\n\\nThe Fragrant Hill Hotel opened on October 17, 1982, but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff returned for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 206.</ref> The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered on the work of American [[postmodern architecture|postmodernists]] such as [[Michael Graves]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 206\\u2013207.</ref>\\n\\n=== Javits Convention Center, New York ===\\n[[File:Javits Center 11av jeh.JPG|thumb|alt=A building of dark tinted glass stands over a city street. The corners of the building are smoothed at 45-degree angles.|Pei said of the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]]: \\\"The complications exceeded even my expectations.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 211.</ref>]]\\n\\nAs the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei began work on the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] in New York City, for which his associate [[James Ingo Freed|James Freed]] served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in what was then a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate [[space frame]] of interconnected metal rods and spheres.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 211\\u2013216.</ref>\\n\\nThe convention center was plagued from the start by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes to be used in the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects: 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 222\\u2013224.</ref> The Javits Center opened on April 3, 1986, to a generally positive reception.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gottlieb |first=Martin |date=1986-04-04 |title=Javits Center Bustles on Opening Day |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/04/nyregion/javits-center-bustles-on-opening-day.html |access-date=2023-12-01 |website=The New York Times |language=en-US}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Grand Louvre, Paris ===\\n{{main|Grand Louvre}}\\n[[File:Paris 75001 Cour Napol\\u00e9on Louvre Aile Turgot 02a.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A classical building with ornamental design rises above a small crowd. Rounded archways line the front of the structure.|Pei was acutely aware, as he said, that \\\"the history of Paris was embedded in the stones of the Louvre.\\\"<ref name=\\\"Boehm, p. 84\\\">Boehm, p. 84.</ref>]]\\n\\nWhen [[Fran\\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] was elected President of France in 1981, he laid out an ambitious plan for a variety of construction projects. One of these was the renovation of the [[Louvre]]. Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named {{ill|\\u00c9mile Biasini|fr}} to oversee it. After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the U.S. National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team. The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there.<ref>Wiseman, p. 233; Boehm, p. 77.</ref> Pei finally agreed that a new construction project was not only possible, but necessary for the future of the museum. He thus became the first foreign architect to work on the Louvre.<ref>Wiseman, p. 234.</ref>\\n\\nThe heart of the new design included not only a renovation of the [[Cour Napol\\u00e9on]] in the midst of the buildings, but also a transformation of the interiors. Pei proposed a central entrance, not unlike the lobby of the National Gallery East Building, which would link the three major wings around the central space. Below would be a complex of additional floors for research, storage, and maintenance purposes. At the center of the courtyard he designed a [[Louvre Pyramid|glass and steel pyramid]], first proposed with the Kennedy Library, to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight. It was mirrored by an [[Pyramide Invers\\u00e9e|inverted pyramid]] to the west, to reflect sunlight into the complex. These designs were partly an homage to the fastidious geometry of the French landscape architect [[Andr\\u00e9 Le N\\u00f4tre]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 235\\u2013236.</ref> Pei also found the pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency, and considered it \\\"most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre, especially with the faceted planes of its roofs\\\".<ref name=\\\"Boehm, p. 84\\\" />\\n\\nBiasini and Mitterrand liked the plans, but the scope of the renovation displeased Louvre administrator Andr\\u00e9 Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was \\\"unfeasible\\\" and posed \\\"architectural risks\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 240.</ref> Some sections of the French public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 249\\u2013250.</ref> One critic called it a \\\"gigantic, ruinous gadget\\\";<ref name=\\\"w249\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 249.</ref> another charged Mitterrand with \\\"despotism\\\" for inflicting Paris with the \\\"atrocity\\\".<ref name=\\\"w249\\\" /> Pei estimated that 90&nbsp;percent of Parisians opposed his design. \\\"I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris,\\\" he said.<ref>Boehm, p. 80.</ref> Some condemnations carried [[nationalism|nationalistic]] overtones. One opponent wrote: \\\"I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 250.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Louvre Museum Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A gray pyramid sits in the center of a courtyard, surrounded by ancient buildings.|Pei decided that a pyramid was \\\"most compatible\\\" with the other structures at the Louvre, complementing their roofs' faceted planes.<ref name=\\\"Boehm, p. 84\\\" />]]\\nSoon, however, Pei and his team won the support of several key cultural icons, including the conductor [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Claude Pompidou]], widow of former French President [[Georges Pompidou]], after whom the similarly controversial [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris [[Jacques Chirac]] and placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000&nbsp;people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 251\\u2013252.</ref>\\n\\nPei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes. The pyramid was constructed at the same time as the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages. As they worked, construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25,000&nbsp;historical items; these were incorporated into the rest of the structure to add a new exhibition zone.<ref>Wiseman, p. 257.</ref>\\n\\nThe new [[Cour Napol\\u00e9on]] was opened to the public on October 14, 1988, and the Pyramid entrance was opened the following March. By this time, public opposition had softened; a poll found a 56 percent approval rating for the pyramid, with 23 percent still opposed.

At the age of 72, Pei had begun thinking about retirement, but continued working long hours to see his designs come to light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 263\\u2013264.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Dallas Meyerson Center 02.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A beige cube rises at an angle around a half-cone made of glass and steel. In front, a square archway overlooks a stone courtyard.|Although he usually designed entirely by hand, Pei used a computer to \\\"confirm the spaces\\\" for the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]] in [[Dallas]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 272.</ref>]]\\nOne of the projects took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]]. The success of city's performing artists, particularly the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] then led by conductor [[Eduardo Mata]], led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in Europe. The organizing committee contacted 45&nbsp;architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that his work on the Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression. One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee. He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission. As one member put it: \\\"We were convinced that we would get the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 267.</ref>\\n\\nBecause its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on [[acoustics]] first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a [[Shoebox style (architecture)|shoebox]] auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the [[Concertgebouw, Amsterdam|Amsterdam Concertgebouw]] and [[Musikverein|Vienna Musikverein]]. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect [[Johann Balthasar Neumann]], especially the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]]. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Op\\u00e9ra]] designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 269\\u2013270.</ref>\\n\\nPei's design placed the rigid shoebox at an angle to the surrounding street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like [[filigree]]. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. \\\"I can imagine only 60&nbsp;percent of the space in this building,\\\" he said during the early stages. \\\"The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 272.</ref> As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon [[Ross Perot]] made a donation of US$10&nbsp;million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 273\\u2013274.</ref>\\n\\nThe building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending a week of performances in the hall, a music critic for ''The New York Times'' wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was \\\"a very mature building\\\"; he smiled and replied: \\\"Ah, but did I have to wait this long?\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 286.</ref>\\n\\n=== Bank of China, Hong Kong ===\\n\\nA new offer had arrived for Pei from the Chinese government in 1982. With an eye toward the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the [[Bank of China]]. The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hills, he agreed to accept the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 286\\u2013287.</ref>\\n\\nThe proposed site in Hong Kong's [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]] was less than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World War&nbsp;II, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in [[Katonah, New York|Katonah]], New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 287\\u2013288.</ref>\\n\\nPei felt that his design for the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] needed to reflect \\\"the aspirations of the Chinese people\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 288.</ref>  The design that he developed for the skyscraper was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The building is composed of four triangular shafts rising up from a square base, supported by a visible [[truss]] structure that distributes stress to the four corners of the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around  diagonal bracing in a union of structure and form that reiterates the triangle motif established in the plan. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of ''[[feng shui]]'' in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 289\\u2013291.</ref>\\n\\nAs the tower neared completion, Pei was shocked to witness the government's massacre of unarmed civilians at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. He wrote an opinion piece for ''The New York Times'' titled \\\"China Won't Ever Be the Same\\\", in which he said that the killings \\\"tore the heart out of a generation that carries the hope for the future of the country\\\".<ref name=\\\"WQ294\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 294.</ref> The massacre deeply disturbed his entire family, and he wrote that \\\"China is besmirched.\\\"<ref name=\\\"WQ294\\\" />\\n\\n=== 1990\\u20132019: museum projects ===\\n[[File:Cleveland August 2015 47 (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A gray tiled building rises over a lake, with a cylinder set on a narrow pole, and a sloping glass wall on one end.|One staff member sympathized with Pei's frustrations with the lack of organization at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], admitting that he was \\\"operating in a vacuum\\\".<ref name=\\\"WQ307\\\" />]]\\n\\nAs the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm. The staff had begun to shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set to work on his last major project as active partner: the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of [[high culture]] as the Louvre and U.S. National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to [[low culture]]. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. Pei accepted the commission in part because of the unique challenge it presented.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 303\\u2013306.</ref>\\n\\nUsing a glass wall for the entrance, similar in appearance to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated the exterior of the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space. The combination of off-centered wraparounds and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide \\\"a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about\\\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 306.</ref>\\n\\nThe building opened in 1995, and was received with moderate praise. ''The New York Times'' called it \\\"a fine building\\\", but Pei was among those who felt disappointed with the results. The museum's early beginnings in New York combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed.<ref name=\\\"WQ307\\\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 307.</ref> Although the city of Cleveland benefited greatly from the new tourist attraction, Pei was unhappy with it.<ref name=\\\"WQ307\\\" />\\n\\nAt the same time, Pei designed a new museum for [[Luxembourg]], the ''Mus\\u00e9e d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean'', commonly known as the [[Mudam]]. Drawing from the original shape of the [[Fort Th\\u00fcngen]] walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 311\\u2013313.</ref>\\n\\nIn 1995, Pei was hired to design an extension to the ''[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]'', or German Historical Museum in Berlin. Returning to the challenge of the East Building of the U.S. National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a [[Modernism|modernist]] approach with a classical main structure. He described the glass cylinder addition as a \\\"beacon\\\",<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 315.</ref> and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics. \\\"They thought I was nothing but trouble\\\", he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 316.</ref>\\n\\nPei also worked at this time on two projects for a [[Japanese new religions|new Japanese religious movement]] called ''[[Shinji Shumeikai]]''. He was approached by the movement's spiritual leader, Kaishu Koyama, who impressed the architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom. One of the buildings was a bell tower, designed to resemble the ''[[bachi]]'' used when playing traditional instruments like the ''[[shamisen]]''. Pei was unfamiliar with the movement's beliefs, but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in the tower. As he said: \\\"It was a search for the sort of expression that is not at all technical.\\\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 300.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Miho museum02n3872.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A curving circular tunnel opens to reveal a building with a tall sloping roof and a circular window in the front door.|Pei's tunnel through a mountain leading to the [[Miho Museum]] was partly inspired by a story from fourth-century Chinese poet [[Tao Yuanming]].<ref>Boehm, pp. 99\\u2013100.</ref>]]\\nThe experience was rewarding for Pei, and he agreed immediately to work with the group again. The new project was the [[Miho Museum]], to display Koyama's collection of [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] artifacts. Pei visited the site in [[Shiga Prefecture]], and during their conversations convinced Koyama to expand her collection. She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300&nbsp;items showcasing the history of the [[Silk Road]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 317\\u2013319.</ref>\\n\\nOne major challenge was the approach to the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80&nbsp;percent of the building underground.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 318\\u2013320.</ref>\\n\\nWhen designing the exterior, Pei borrowed from the tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby [[Kyoto]]. He created a concise [[Space frame|spaceframe]] wrapped into French limestone and covered with a glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old ''[[Zelkova serrata|keyaki]]'' tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350&nbsp;million.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 320\\u2013322.</ref>\\n\\nDuring the first decade of the 2000s, Pei designed a variety of buildings, including the [[Suzhou Museum]] near his childhood home.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/arts/design/09pei.html |title=I.

He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in [[Cairo]].\\n\\nOnce again, Pei sought to combine new design elements with the classical aesthetic most appropriate for the location of the building. The sand-colored rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior. Inside, galleries are arranged around a massive atrium, lit from above.

Born in [[Kingston upon Hull]], in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], he trained at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], but his studies\\u2014and the early stages of his career\\u2014were curtailed by the [[Second World War]]. After his [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilisation]] he returned to acting and found success, initially in [[revue]] and [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] productions.\\n\\nIn 1955 Carmichael was noticed by the film producers [[Boulting brothers|John and Roy Boulting]], who cast him in five of their films as one of the major players. The first was the 1956 film ''[[Private's Progress]]'', a satire on the [[British Army]]; he received critical and popular praise for the role, including from the American market. In many of his roles he played a likeable, often accident-prone, innocent. In the mid-1960s he played [[Bertie Wooster]] in adaptations of the works of [[P. G. Wodehouse]] in ''[[The World of Wooster]]'' for [[BBC Television]], for which he received mostly positive reviews, including from Wodehouse. In the early 1970s he played another [[upper-class]] literary character, [[Lord Peter Wimsey]], the amateur but talented investigator created by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]].\\n\\nMuch of Carmichael's success came through a disciplined approach to training and rehearsing for a role. He learned much about the craft and technique of humour while appearing with the comic actor [[Leo Franklyn]]. Although Carmichael tired of being [[typecast]] as the affable but bumbling upper-class Englishman, his craft ensured that while audiences laughed at his antics, he retained their affection; [[Dennis Barker]], in Carmichael's obituary in ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote that he \\\"could play fool parts in a way that did not cut the characters completely off from human sympathy: a certain dignity was always maintained\\\".{{sfn|Barker|2010|p=35}}\\n\\n==Biography==\\n===Early life===\\n[[File:Bromsgrove School.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Large red-brick Georgian building|[[Bromsgrove School]]]]\\nIan Gillett Carmichael was born on 18 June 1920 in [[Kingston upon Hull]], in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]. He was the eldest child of Kate ({{nee}} Gillett) and her husband Arthur Denholm Carmichael, an optician on the premises of his family's firm of jewellers.{{sfn|Hubbard|O'Donnell|Steen|1989|p=63}}{{sfn|Jennings|2014}} Carmichael had two younger sisters, the twins Mary and Margaret, who were born in December 1923.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=11}} Robert Fairclough, his biographer, describes Carmichael's upbringing as a \\\"privileged, pampered existence\\\"; his parents employed maids and a cook.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|pp=5, 11}} His infant education included one term at the local Froebel House School when he was four, but this was curtailed after his parents were shocked at the \\\"alarmingly foul language he began bringing home\\\", according to Alex Jennings, Carmichael's biographer in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''.{{sfn|Jennings|2014}}{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|p=29}}\\n\\nIn 1928 Carmichael was sent to [[Scarborough College]], a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]] in [[North Yorkshire]], which he attended between the ages of seven and thirteen.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|pp=13\\u201315}} He did not like the [[wikt:spartan#Adjective|spartan]] and authoritarian regime at the school. He described the discipline as \\\"[[wikt:Dickensian#Adjective|Dickensian]]\\\", with [[corporal punishment]] used for even minor infringements of the rules; ablutions in the morning and evening were conducted with cold water\\u2014which often had a film of ice on the top during winter.{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|pp=32\\u201333}}\\n\\nIn 1933 Carmichael left Scarborough College and entered [[Bromsgrove School]], a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in [[Worcestershire]].{{sfn|Jennings|2014}}{{efn|A [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in the UK is a fee-paying institution, associated with the [[ruling class]] and upper echelons of banking, business and industry.{{sfn|Sampson|1982|p=124}}}} He soon concluded that \\\"the new curriculum was not arduous\\\",{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|p=48}} which gave him the opportunity for focus on matters that were of more interest for him: acting, popular music and cricket.{{sfn|Jennings|2014}}{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|pp=48, 55\\u201359}} In the late 1930s Carmichael decided to go to the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London. His parents would have preferred he went into the family jewellery business, but accepted their son's decision and supported him financially when he left Yorkshire for London in January 1939.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|pp=22\\u201323}}{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|p=69}}\\n\\n===Early career and war service, 1939\\u20131946===\\n{{main|Ian Carmichael on stage, screen and radio}}\\nCarmichael enjoyed his time at RADA, including the fact that women outnumbered men on his course, which he described as \\\"heady stuff\\\" after his boys-only boarding school.{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|pp=74\\u201375}} He remembered the time at RADA in the late 1930s fondly in his autobiography, describing it as:\\n\\n<blockquote>A period of unconfined joy, occasioned by my finally shaking off the shackles of school discipline and being able to mix daily with young men and young women who shared my interests and enthusiasms. This joy was, nevertheless, being tempered by the worsening European situation. The fear that now, just as I was standing on the threshold of a future that I had dreamed about for years, the whole thing might be snuffed out like a candle was too unbearable to contemplate.{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|p=72}}</blockquote>\\n\\nDuring his second term Carmichael had his first professional acting role: as a robot in [[Karel \\u010capek]]'s ''[[R.U.R.]]'' at the People's Palace theatre, in [[Mile End]], East London.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=27}} He recalled the experience as \\\"a dull play performed in a cold and uninspiring theatre and my particular contribution required absolutely no acting talent whatsoever\\\".{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|pp=77\\u201378}} He then appeared as [[Francis Flute|Flute]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' at RADA's [[Vanbrugh Theatre]]. The opening night was 1 September 1939, the day [[Invasion of Poland|Hitler invaded Poland]]. After the play's second performance its run was ended, as RADA shut down in anticipation that war was about to be declared; the following day the UK joined the war. Carmichael returned to his familial home and completed the forms to join the Officer Cadet Reserve, hoping to be commissioned as an officer. He helped gather the harvest in a nearby farm until 2 October, when he was [[Oath of Allegiance (United_Kingdom)#Armed_forces|attested]] into the army; he was told he would have to wait until he was twenty\\u2014on 18 June 1940\\u2014before he started training.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|pp=27\\u201328}}\\n\\nAs the early months of the war were marked by [[Phoney War|limited military action]], RADA reassessed its closure, and decided to reopen. Carmichael returned to London and shared lodgings with two fellow RADA students, [[Geoffrey Hibbert]] and [[Patrick Macnee]]; Carmichael and Macnee became lifelong friends. Between June and August 1940 Carmichael was on a ten-week tour of ''Nine Sharp'', a [[revue]] developed by [[Herbert Farjeon]]. After the tour Carmichael reported for training on 12 September at [[Catterick Garrison]].{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|pp=29\\u201331}} After ten weeks' basic training, he was posted to the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] to become an officer cadet.{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|p=108}} He completed his training and [[Passing out (military)|passed out]] in March 1941 as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[22nd Dragoons]], part of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]].{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|''The London Gazette''. 28 March 1941}}\\n\\nAt the end of training manoeuvres in November 1941, near [[Whitby]], North Yorkshire, Carmichael was struggling to close the hatch of his [[Valentine tank]] when it slammed down, cutting off the top of a finger on his left hand. The surgery was botched and caused him pain for several months; he had a second operation several months later.{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|pp=127\\u2013129}} He described it as \\\"dashed unfortunate\\\"{{sfn|\\\"Ian Carmichael: Actor\\\". ''The Times''. 8 February 2010}} and \\\"my one and only war-wound, albeit a self-inflicted one\\\".{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|pp=127\\u2013129}}\\n\\nIn between training for the [[liberation of France]] Carmichael began producing revues and productions as part of his brigade's entertainment. On 16 June 1944, ten days after [[D-Day]], Carmichael and his armoured reconnaissance troop landed in France. He fought through to Germany with the regiment and by the time of [[Victory in Europe Day]] in May 1945, he had been promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and [[mentioned in despatches]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carmichael|1y=1979|1pp=145\\u2013146, 160\\u2013179|2a1=Fairclough|2y=2011|2pp=36\\u201340|3a1=Barker|3y=2010|3p=35}}{{sfn|''The London Gazette''. 7 August 1945}}\\n\\n[[File:Frankie Howard Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Howerd looking directly at the camera|[[Frankie Howerd]], whom Carmichael auditioned and thought \\\"very gauche&nbsp;... too undisciplined and not very funny either\\\".{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=41}}]]\\nCarmichael's regiment was part of [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|30 Corps]] and an initial post-war challenge in Germany was the welfare of the occupying forces. The corps' commanding officer was Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]], who ordered a [[repertory company]] to be formed for entertainment. When Carmichael auditioned he recognised the [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] in charge of the unit as Richard Stone, an actor who had been a contemporary at RADA; Carmichael was taken into the company and assisted Stone with auditioning other members.{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|pp=182\\u2013184}}{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=41}} One of the comedians who auditioned was [[Frankie Howerd]], whom Carmichael thought \\\"very gauche&nbsp;... too undisciplined and not very funny either. Very much the amateur\\\".{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|p=184}} Stone disagreed and signed the comic up to perform in a [[Royal Army Service Corps]] concert party.{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=42}} The corps' company was also joined by actors from [[Entertainments National Service Association]] (ENSA); Carmichael did not often appear on stage with them, but worked as the producer of twenty shows. In April 1946 Stone was promoted and was transferred to the UK; Carmichael was promoted to major and took control of the theatrical company. His leadership of the company was short-lived, as he was [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilised]] that July.{{sfn|Carmichael|1979|pp=190\\u2013191}}{{sfn|\\\"Ian Carmichael: Actor\\\". ''The Times''. 8 February 2010}}\\n\\n===Early post-war career, 1946\\u20131955===\\nIn July 1946 Carmichael signed with Stone, who had also been demobilised and had set up as a [[theatrical agent]]. Carmichael obtained his first post-war role in the revue ''Between Ourselves'' in mid-1946 before he appeared in two small roles in the comedy ''[[She Wanted a Cream Front Door]]''\\u2014 a hotel receptionist and a BBC reporter. The production went on a twelve-week tour round Britain from October 1946, and then ran at the [[Apollo Theatre]] in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], London, for four months.{{sfnm|1a1=Carmichael|1y=1979|1pp=197\\u2013199|2a1=Fairclough|2y=2011|2pp=44\\u201345|3a1=Herbert|3y=1972|3p=609}}\\n\\nBetween 1947 and 1951 Carmichael appeared on stage in both plays and revues \\u2014the latter often at the [[Players' Theatre]] in [[Villiers Street]], Charing Cross. He made his debut appearance on [[BBC television]] in 1947 in ''New Faces'', a revue that also included [[Zoe Gail]], [[Bill Fraser]] and [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]].{{sfn|\\\"New Faces\\\". ''Radio Times''}} From 1948 he also began appearing in films, including ''[[Bond Street (film)|Bond Street]]'' (1948), ''[[Trottie True]]'' and ''[[Dear Mr. Prohack]]'' (both 1949); these early roles were minor parts and he was [[Motion picture credits|uncredited]].{{sfn|Pettigrew|1982|p=30}} He spent much of 1949 in a thirty-week tour of Britain with the operetta ''[[The Lilac Domino]]''.{{sfn|Quinlan|1992|p=52}} According to Jennings, Carmichael's \\\"first conspicuous success\\\" was ''The Lyric Revue'' in 1951; the production transferred to The Globe (now the [[Gielgud Theatre]]) as ''The Globe Revue'' in 1952.{{sfn|Jennings|2014}} He received a positive review in the industry publication ''[[The Stage]]'', which reported that he \\\"[[wikt:bullseye#Interjection|hits the bull's-eye]]\\\" for his comic performance in one [[Sketch comedy|sketch]], \\\"Bank Holiday\\\", which involved him undressing on the beach under a [[mackintosh]].{{sfn|\\\"The Globe\\\". ''The Stage''}}\\n\\nCarmichael spent the next three years appearing in stage revues and small roles in films.{{sfn|Jennings|2014}} Although he enjoyed working in revues, he was concerned about being stuck in a career rut. In a 1954 interview in ''The Stage'', he said \\\"I'm afraid that managers and directors may think of me only as a revue artist, and much as I enjoy acting in sketches I feel there must be a limit to the number of characters one is able to create. What I would like now is to be offered a part in light comedy or a farce\\\".{{sfn|Bullock|1954|p=10}} Between November 1954 and May 1955 he appeared as David Prentice in the stage production of ''Simon and Laura'' alongside [[Roland Culver]] and [[Coral Browne]] at the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]], London. The following year [[Simon and Laura|a film version]] was directed by [[Muriel Box]]; she asked Carmichael to repeat his role, while Browne and Culver's roles were taken by [[Kay Kendall]] and [[Peter Finch]].{{sfn|Jennings|2014}} The reviewer for ''[[The Times]]'' thought Carmichael \\\"comes near to stealing the film from both of them\\\".{{sfn|\\\"Television's Ideal Married Couple Date\\\". ''The Times''}} In 1955 Carmichael also appeared in ''[[The Colditz Story]]''. He played Robin Cartwright, an officer in [[Foot guards#United Kingdom|the Guards]], and spent much of his screen time appearing with [[Richard Wattis]]; the two men provided an element of [[comic relief]] in the film, with what Fairclough describes as a \\\"[[Flanagan and Allen]] tribute act\\\".{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|pp=70\\u201371}} ''The Colditz Story'' was Carmichael's ninth film role and he had, Fairclough notes, risen to sixth in the credits behind [[John Mills]] and [[Eric Portman]].{{sfn|Fairclough|2011|p=71}}\\n\\n===Screen success, 1955\\u20131962===\\n[[File:Ian Carmichael and Jill Adams in Private's Progress.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Carmichael and Adams dressed in army uniforms on the set of an office|Carmichael and [[Jill Adams]] in ''[[Private's Progress]]'' (1956)]]\\nIn 1955 Carmichael was contacted by the filmmaker twins the [[Boulting brothers]].
